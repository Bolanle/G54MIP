        <headline>Darden Rejects Proposal to Sell Real Estate</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Darden Restaurants (DRI) Inc., the owner
            of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, said splitting off its real
            estate holdings wouldn't increase shareholder value, rejecting a
            strategy pushed by activist investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Darden spurned the idea after consulting with financial
            advisers Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), according
            to a statement today. The company's board also worked with law
            firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen Katz to assess the demands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Darden is facing increased pressure from activists,
            including Starboard Value LP and Barington Capital Group LP, to
            spin off its restaurant properties and shake up company
            management. The real estate is worth about $4 billion, Starboard
            said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A real estate separation would not enhance long-term
            shareholder value,' Darden responded in today's statement.
            'The company will review the latest Starboard materials and
            looks forward to addressing them in its ongoing conversations
            with Darden shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the Orlando, Florida-based company have declined
            5.3 percent this year. The stock gained 1.4 percent to $51.48 at
            the close today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, Barington asked Darden to consider replacing
            Chief Executive Officer Clarence Otis, saying the company has
            underperformed during his tenure and that his restructuring plan
            may destroy value. Otis, who became CEO in 2004 and chairman in
            2005, is working to separate Darden's Red Lobster seafood chain
            through a tax-free spinoff or sale. Starboard has joined
            Barington in opposing Otis's plan. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Cohn Says Banks Other Than Goldman, JPMorgan Retrenching</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) are among the only top banks in the world
            that aren't reducing capacity, Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You're seeing big international banks, outside of
            ourselves and JPMorgan, really taking a pretty substantial step
            back from the markets, and we hadn't seen that in the entire
            history of banking,' Cohn, 52, told journalists today at
            Goldman Sachs's office in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn cited plans by Zurich-based UBS AG and Credit Suisse
            Group AG to cut risk-weighted assets, reduce balance sheets and
            withdraw from certain markets and regions after suffering losses
            during the credit crisis. Deutsche Bank AG plans to reduce
            balance-sheet leverage as well, and London-based Barclays Plc is
            facing restrictions from the U.K. government, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The only capacity we've ever seen taken out of banks is
            banks merging with each other over the last 50 years,' Cohn
            said. 'Now we are actually seeing banks withdraw from
            investment banking and the capital-markets business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While competition from major international institutions is
            easing, New York-based Goldman Sachs is confronting stronger
            local banks in regions including Brazil, Singapore, Japan and
            Hong Kong, Cohn said. Goldman Sachs faces the strongest local
            competitors in Brazil, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sopra Said to Plan Steria Merger in Computer Services Tie-Up</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sopra Group SA (SOP) and Groupe Steria
            SCA (RIA), two of France's oldest computer-services providers, are
            planning to merge in an attempt to win business from rivals
            including Atos and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), a
            person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies' boards are meeting today to decide on a
            combination, said the person, who asked not to be identified
            because the discussions are private. The companies have been
            negotiating for six months, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A merger could help the companies offer a wider array of
            services and reduce costs as they compete against larger peers
            IBM and Accenture Plc (ACN) as well as local rivals Atos and Cap
            Gemini SA. (CAP) Sopra, based in Paris, has a market value of about 1
            billion euros ($1.4 billion), while that of Velizy, France-based
            Steria is 522 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a good idea because for these kind of mid-cap
            companies in IT services, critical size is very important for
            winning contracts,' said Emmanuel Parot, an analyst at Gilbert
            Dupont in Paris. The companies are complementary geographically,
            he said. Sopra had 68 percent of revenue coming from France in
            2012, while Steria got 40 percent of sales from the U.K. that
            year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wells Fargo Sells Servicing on Fannie Mae Loans to Walter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the nation's
            biggest home lender, sold servicing rights to $12.2 billion of
            reverse mortgages to Walter Investment Management Corp. (WAC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The loans are owned by Fannie Mae, and Wells Fargo will
            continue to service other reverse-mortgage loans in its
            portfolio, Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-
            based bank, said in an e-mail. Terms weren't disclosed in a
            statement today from Tampa, Florida-based Walter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo was ranked as the largest U.S. residential
            mortgage servicer at the end of December, with contracts on
            $1.87 trillion in unpaid home loans. The bank said in 2011 that
            it would stop originating reverse mortgages. Today's transaction
            won't significantly affect earnings, Adams said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo's decision to exit the business was tied to the
            possibility that home values would fall, according to its
            statement at the time. Prices declined 5.3 percent from the end
            of that month through March last year before rebounding 9
            percent through January, according to the SP/Case-Shiller index
            of data from 20 U.S. cities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's transaction, which involves 76,000 loans, will
            double the size of Walter's serviced book and be completed in
            the third quarter, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reverse-mortgage lenders issue loans to homeowners and
            accept real estate equity as collateral, allowing borrowers, age
            62 or older, to remain in their homes and receive either a lump-
            sum payment or a stream of income. Mortgage servicers handle
            billing and collections on behalf of lenders or investors that
            own the loans and oversee foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Drops on Goldman Says PC Share Falling</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) tumbled the most in
            more than a year after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
            software maker is struggling with slack personal-computer sales
            and its push into consumer devices has failed to gain traction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a note to investors today, Heather Bellini, a New York-
            based analyst at Goldman Sachs, recommended that investors sell
            the stock. She downgraded the shares from a neutral rating.
            Since yesterday, at least two other analysts have also reduced
            their ratings on shares of the world's largest software company,
            based in Redmond, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lackluster corporate demand for Microsoft's new Windows 8
            operating system helped send PC shipments plummeting 14 percent
            worldwide in the first quarter, according to IDC, making it the
            worst quarter since the researcher starting tracking sales.
            Consumers are also increasingly opting to forgo PCs in favor of
            smartphones and tablet machines, markets where Microsoft's
            offerings are selling poorly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The company faces critical secular challenges given the
            deteriorating PC demand backdrop,' Bellini wrote. Financial
            results will 'gradually deteriorate unless Microsoft
            successfully repositions itself as a more meaningful participant
            in the new era of consumer compute.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Walter Gains After Market Close as Quarterly Coal Sales Rise</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
            metallurgical coal in the U.S. and Canada, advanced in post-
            market trading after reporting steelmaking coal sales increased
            17 percent during the first quarter from the year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter shares jumped 5.7 percent to $25.50 at 5:26 p.m. in
            New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal sales rose to 2.8 million metric tons in
            the first quarter, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in
            a statement after the close of regular trading today. Average
            first-quarter prices 'are expected to improve slightly,'
            compared with the previous quarter, the company said. Walter
            received $149 a metric ton on average in the fourth quarter, the
            company said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment adviser Audley Capital Advisors LLP has
            nominated five new members to Walter's board, saying the current
            board has taken on too much debt and failed to create
            shareholder value. Shareholders will vote for directors at the
            company's annual meeting on April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is scheduled to report first-quarter results on
            May 2. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Onex Pay for Schwartz Tops Disney, Coca-Cola, Visa</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Onex Corp. (OCX), Canada's largest buyout
            firm, paid Chief Executive Officer and founder Gerald Schwartz
            $85.3 million in 2013 compensation, higher than payouts for the
            top executives of Walt Disney Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Visa Inc.
            combined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 72, received an annual salary of $1.3 million, a
            bonus of $24.4 million and $59.6 million in stock options -- his
            first stock-option award in a decade -- the Toronto-based firm
            said in an April 7 filing with Canadian regulators. By
            comparison, Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger was paid $34.3 million
            in annual compensation, while Visa's top executive Charles Scharf received $24.2 million and Coca-Cola CEO
            Muhtar Kent got
            $20.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The committee and the board are of the view that stock
            options are an integral part of executive compensation and are
            fundamental to the alignment of interests and the
            incentivization of future performance,' Onex said in its
            filing, as an explanation for awarding Schwartz 3,950,000
            options. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A message left with Onex spokeswoman Emma Thompson wasn't
            immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz' pay is more than any executive in the Standard
            and Poor's 500 Index this year, including Tim Cook, who received
            compensation of $4.3 million as chief executive of Apple Inc.,
            the U.S.'s biggest company by market value, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The data ranks the highest-paid
            executives as reported in the summary compensation table for SP
            500 companies with a fiscal year-end of Sept. 1, 2013 or later,
            and have filed proxy statements for 2013 as of the market close
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Paid Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Onex said in its filing that Schwartz last received options
            in early 2004 and exercised those last year, shortly prior to
            their expiry. As a result, Schwartz ceased to hold any options
            to buy Onex shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Onex has gained 26 percent over the past 12 months,
            compared with a total return of 18 percent for the SP/TSX
            Composite Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz also received $28.5 million in carried interest
            payments, or his slice of investment profits, as well as $12.5
            million from co-investments made with Onex, the filing said. He
            also received about $2.8 million in dividend payouts from owning
            20.1 million shares, according to calculations by Bloomberg.
            That would lift Schwartz's total from pay, investments and
            dividends to about $129 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP chief Steve Schwarzman received $374.5
            million last year in pay and cash dividends, according to a Feb.
            28 company filing. Schwarzman was paid a $350,000 salary and got
            $21.6 million in carried interest. He received $352.5 million in
            cash distributions during the year from ownership of partnership
            units in the New York-based firm he co-founded in 1985 as a
            leveraged-buyout group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Onex awarded stock options to senior managing directors due
            to an 'evolution' in the company's management structure. The
            firm last year appointed four senior managing directors -- Ewout Heersink, Robert Le Blanc, Seth Mersky and
            Anthony Munk -- along
            with Schwartz to a newly formed executive committee, to help the
            CEO guide the strategic direction of the firm. Le Blanc, Mersky
            and Munk received a one-time grant of 850,000 options to buy
            subordinate voting shares, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These option grants do not represent a routine practice
            of the committee or the board, but rather were intended to
            acknowledge an expectation as to the senior managing directors'
            future contribution to growth and management of the firm,' the
            filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Munk's Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Le Blanc's total compensation was $23.3 million, while Munk
            was paid $19 million and Seth Mersky received $17.3 million, the
            filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Summary compensation tables are mandated by the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission and show some awards in the
            year they're granted rather than for the year they're earned.
            Some awards are restricted, vesting and paying out over a set
            time frame, and the receipt of others may depend on future
            performance goals. The summary compensation table also counts
            changes in pension and the value of perks. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last-minute proposal may lead to a protracted battle for Maker, a supplier of video
            content to YouTube and one of the top online networks for young audiences. The deal is further complicated
            by a lawsuit filed by Danny Zappin, a former chief executive of Maker Studios, and three co-founders, who
            are trying to stop a shareholder vote set for tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relativity made an initial bid
            yesterday, offering as much as $1 billion, and amended it today, the person said. The Wall Street Journal
            reported on the proposal earlier today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dena Cook, a spokeswoman for Maker, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The offer includes a 'substantial opportunity for Maker's talent and employees
            to directly and significantly participate in the long-term growth of Relativity,' said David Shane, a
            spokesman for Relativity, which is based in Beverly Hills, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, based in
            Burbank, California, agreed on March 24 to acquire Maker, a supplier of content for Google Inc.'s YouTube
            video-sharing site, for $500 million, plus as much as $450 million more if performance targets are met. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Maker Vote &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maker has scheduled a vote on Disney's offer for tomorrow. The
            company has more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and 5.5 billion views a month on YouTube,
            Disney said at time of its purchase announcement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zappin and three other co-founders of
            Maker asked a state court judge in Los Angeles to block the April 15 vote on the Disney offer, saying the
            notice to shareholders was misleading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Certain Maker directors illegally issued shares
            to themselves and diluted the common stock for their own financial gain to the detriment of other Maker
            shareholders and take control of Makers' board so that they could rapidly create a liquidity event,' Zappin
            said in a filing last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Walter Energy Declines the Most in 18 Months After China Slows</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S.
            producer of metallurgical coal that is the target of a
            shareholder action, fell the most in 18 months after unexpected
            slowing of economic growth in China, the metal's biggest user. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter tumbled 12 percent to $21.28 at 1:50 p.m. in New
            York after the Birmingham, Alabama-based company fell as much as
            13 percent, the most since Sept. 21, 2011. Alpha Natural
            Resources Inc. (ANR), the country's second-largest coal miner by
            sales, fell as much as 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's economic growth lost momentum as factory output
            weakened last month, according to data from the National Bureau
            of Statistics in Beijing. The economy expanded at a 7.7 percent
            annual pace in the first quarter, the bureau said today,
            compared with 8 percent expected by analysts' estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter led declines in companies producing metals and
            steelmaking ingredients because investors are concerned about
            the outcome of a shareholder action at the company, said Daniel Scott, an analyst at Cowen and Co. in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everything is getting obliterated by the Chinese data,'
            Scott said in an interview by phone today. Walter 'has just got
            the stigma of uncertainty to it on top of everything else.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Audley Capital Advisors LLC has nominated five directors to
            Walter's board, saying the company's administrative costs and
            debt are too high. Egan-Jones Ratings Co., Institutional
            Shareholder Services Inc., and Glass Lewis Co. LLC have
            recommended shareholders vote for the existing directors.
            Walter's annual meeting is scheduled for April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. expects the price of metallurgical coal to
            fall 4 percent to $165 a ton in the third quarter from $172 this
            quarter, according to an April 12 report. Low-volatility coking
            coal traded at $157.50 on March 22, according to data from
            Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy Publishing Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. coal producer is Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Bond Market Needs Improved Fairness, SEC's Walter Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The $38 trillion U.S. bond market
            needs to be improved to allow better access for all investors,
            said Securities and Exchange Commission member Elisse Walter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The more I look at it the more concerns about fairness I
            have,' she said today at the start of a series of roundtable
            discussions the agency is holding in Washington on fixed-income
            markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter sought to assure participants that the agency isn't
            trying to impose an equity-market structure on bonds with
            exchange trading and pre-trade price transparency. The
            challenge, she said, is for regulators to understand the
            complexity of how debt trades to discover what must be changed.
            'In this arena, I keep having to reassure people that we get
            it,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dealers have scaled back principal trading in the market
            amid pressure to increase capital to meet international
            standards and as they face lower profits from more transparency
            created by Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, according to a report
            today by consulting firm Tabb Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bond inventories at primary dealers that trade
            directly with the Federal Reserve have dropped to $56 billion,
            below the average of $69.3 billion since the end of 2009 and
            down from a peak of $235 billion in October 2007, Fed data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Leaving Footprints &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dealers cannot quote in size and wide enough spread to
            justify the capital deployment' to hold an inventory of bonds,
            Will Rhode and Henry Chien wrote in the Tabb report. A system
            for creating instantaneous quotes needs to be developed, they
            said. 'The challenge is simple: how do you price a bond trade
            in real time?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One concern for investors is showing large trades to the
            entire market on bond trading systems, said Robert Auwaerter,
            head of the fixed-income group at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-
            based Vanguard Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You leave a footprint in the market that disadvantages
            you,' Auwaerter, a panelist on the first roundtable, said.
            'It's better to try to go around quietly to dealers' because
            'if you advertise it to the world you destroy your bid-price
            execution,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the $9.1 trillion U.S. corporate-bond market, about half
            of trades are larger than $5 million, said Eric Pitt, a managing
            director at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) in New York. For those
            transactions, investors feel they can get better prices by
            talking directly to dealers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bigger Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Would it work to electronify that part of the market?'
            he said during a panel discussion on corporate and asset-backed
            securities. 'Is there a problem to be solved?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The size of new bond deals also has risen as underwriters
            give more preference to larger offerings than in the past, said
            Neil Schloss, the treasurer at Ford Motor Co. While $500 million
            was once considered a large enough bond offering, the company is
            now told that debt sales under $1 billion won't be
            enthusiastically greeted by the market, Schloss said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's more and more demand but less product,'
            JPMorgan's Pitt said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's making it hard for some bond investors to buy the
            amount of debt they want, said Robert Smith, the chief
            investment officer at Austin, Texas-based Sage Advisory Services
            Ltd., which manages about $11 billion. If his firm wants $5
            million to $10 million of a certain issue, he'll tell dealers he
            wants $100 million in order to be taken seriously. Then he ends
            up with $1 million of securities, 'and that's on a good day,'
            Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's a great risk to my business, because one of those
            times I'm going to get $100 million and I don't know how to get
            around that,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The solution should be a single place to access all sizes
            and types of debt, with exchange-like systems alongside
            specialist dealers, Smith said. 'I want a mall,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hedge-Fund Ad Rule Said by SEC's Walter to Boost Risk of Fraud</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A regulation letting hedge funds
            advertise for investors could force the U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission to expand enforcement activity to guard
            against fraud, SEC Commissioner Elisse B. Walter said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investor-protection concerns caused the SEC to miss a
            congressional deadline for finishing the rule called for in last
            year's Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, Walter said in
            testimony at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We would have to expend examination and enforcement
            resources that we would not otherwise have to,' she said in
            addressing questions about why commissioners didn't accelerate
            work on the measure as some SEC staff members suggested. The
            agency needed to analyze questions raised by investor advocates,
            said Walter, who served as SEC chairman from December until Mary Jo White took the helm this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC issued a proposal to lift the ban on hedge-fund
            advertising in August, four months after the JOBS Act became
            law. Debate over how to proceed sparked conflict between Mary Schapiro, who stepped down as chairman in
            December, and
            Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, who said he was furious that
            Schapiro changed her mind about how to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Rise as Capital One, Google Gain on Profits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard Poor's 500 Index rebounding from a six-week low, as companies
            from Capital One Financial Corp. to Google Inc. (GOOG) reported earnings that topped analysts' forecasts.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google and Microsoft Corp. gained at least 3.4 percent. Capital One rallied 6.4 percent
            as income from continuing operations exceeded estimates. International Business Machines Corp., the biggest
            computer-services provider, tumbled 8.3 percent after quarterly profit missed projections for the first time
            since 2005. McDonald's Corp. slumped 2 percent as it said soft global demand has continued this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 advanced 0.9 percent to 1,555.25 at 4 p.m. in New York, paring its biggest weekly loss
            since November to 2.1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10.37 points, or 0.1 percent, to
            14,547.51. About 6.4 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, in line with the three-month average. Options
            contracts expire today, leading investors to adjust their holdings of some stocks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Earnings
            are going to continue to come in better than most people think,' Jeffrey Saut, who helps oversee about $420
            billion as chief investment strategist at Raymond James Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida, said in a
            phone interview. 'Companies have pretty much guided down and expectations are pretty low in terms of upside
            surprises.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Moving Average &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 fell below its 50-day moving
            average yesterday for the first time this year. That level, currently at around 1,544, is watched by some
            analysts to gauge the trend of the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities has
            fallen 2.4 percent from a record close on April 11, spurring concern over what UBS AG strategist Jonathan
            Golub called a 'spring break' in equities. Stocks began short-term declines in April of each of the last
            three years. Still, the benchmark measure has surged 130 percent from a 12-year low in 2009 as the Federal
            Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to stimulate the economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirteen SP
            500 companies including General Electric Co. posted quarterly earnings today. Of the 103 that have reported
            so far, 72 percent have exceeded analysts' predictions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Profits at SP 500
            companies dropped 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year, according to forecasts compiled by
            Bloomberg. That would mark the first year- over-year decrease since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Significant
            Volatility' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This has been the first week in a while where we've seen significant
            volatility,' Ben Schwartz, the Chicago-based chief market strategist at broker Lightspeed Financial Inc.,
            said by phone. 'There's a lot of uncertainty right now, especially in the technology sector. The SP 500 and
            the Nasdaq have traded soft in the last week which is something we haven't seen all year. People are
            tentative with regard to the earnings.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
            Index (VIX), or VIX, briefly erased its loss for the year yesterday. The VIX, which moves in the opposite
            direction as the SP 500 about 80 percent of the time, has risen 32 percent since reaching a six- year low in
            March, including a 43 percent jump on April 15 for its biggest one-day gain since August 2011. The gauge
            retreated 15 percent to 14.97 today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google rose 4.4 percent to $799.87 after the owner
            of the world's most popular search engine posted first-quarter profit, excluding some items, of $11.58 a
            share, surpassing the average analyst forecast of $10.68 a share as advertisers increased spending on mobile
            and video promotions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Rallies &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft climbed 3.4
            percent to $29.77 as third-quarter profit for the world's largest software maker exceeded analysts'
            estimates, buoyed by cost controls and sales of business and server software amid weak demand for personal
            computers running the new Windows 8 operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumer-staples shares, phone
            companies and health-care companies rose more than 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capital One gained 6.4
            percent to $56.17 for the biggest gain in the KBW Bank Index (BKX), which increased 1.5 percent. The
            eighth-largest U.S. lender by assets reported a first-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as
            lending margins improved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) increased 3.6 percent to $28.31 for
            the second-biggest gain in the banking benchmark after earnings exceeded projections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors
            bought shares of corporations most tied to economic growth today. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC) of
            30 U.S. equities and the 20-stock Dow Jones Transportation Index rallied at least 1.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Honeywell Earnings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Honeywell International Ltd. increased 3.8 percent, the
            most since July, to $74.18. The maker of cockpit controls and thermostats predicted second-quarter earnings
            will increase more than analysts estimated, as demand for energy services surges. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PepsiCo
            Inc. climbed 1.9 percent to $82.77 and foodmaker Mondelez International Inc. jumped 5.3 percent to $31.69.
            PepsiCo said it held meetings with billionaire Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management LP as the investor
            disclosed a $269 million stake and also revealed a holding in Mondelez. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peltz could push
            for a merger of the companies, the Daily Telegraph of London reported last month, citing unidentified
            people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) rose 4.7 percent to $106.10 for the biggest gain
            since October 2009 after the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers boosted its annual earnings
            forecast amid sales growth in its North American tissues unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mexican Food &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) soared 12 percent to $366.25 for the biggest gain in the SP 500.
            The Denver-based fast- casual dining chain reported first-quarter sales that topped analysts' estimates,
            helped by an acceleration of store openings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM dropped 8.3 percent to $190 after
            missing profit estimates, hurt by a hardware slump and the failure to sign customers to contracts. The
            shares dropped the most since April 2005, wiping out gains for the year a month after hitting a record high.
            IBM, which accounts for 10 percent of the price- weighted Dow average, took 132 points off the 30-stock
            gauge today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McDonald's slumped 2 percent to $99.92. The world's largest restaurant
            chain by sales posted first-quarter profit that was little changed as same-store sales dropped in the U.S.
            and said soft global demand has continued this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Electric lost 4.1 percent
            to $21.75 after posting first-quarter profit that matched analysts' estimates as lower sales in the Power
            Water business curbed manufacturing growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Europe was weaker than we expected, and in
            particular the power and water and oil and gas businesses were very soft,' Nick Heymann, an analyst at
            William Blair Co. who has a market-perform rating on the stock, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

            U.S. computer industry, are feeling the pain as consumers and businesses flock to mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software company, yesterday reported no growth in Windows sales in
            its latest quarter, after accounting for upgrades sold in the past. IBM is struggling to boost hardware
            sales as more companies let employees use their own devices at work. Meanwhile Google Inc. (GOOG), which is
            expanding beyond its search-engine roots with Android software for smartphones and tablets, is keeping pace
            with the shift, reporting better-than-projected profits from mobile advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
            consumers check e-mail, browse the Web and watch television and movies on the go, PC shipments plummeted 14
            percent in the first quarter, the worst decline since researcher IDC began tracking data in 1994. Microsoft
            and others aren't moving fast enough to end their reliance on traditional computing, according to Brent
            Thill, an analyst at UBS Investment Bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's been a tough start to the year,' said
            San Francisco-based Thill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), which aims to
            generate 20 percent of sales outside the PC industry by the fourth quarter, forecast second-quarter sales
            yesterday that may surpass some analysts' estimates as it diversifies. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks can remain entangled with each other now that global regulators have
            loosened proposed limits on the financial web that led to investor panic in 2008 and prompted bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which set out a year ago to block banks from relying
            too heavily on each other, changed course last week, opting to let firms preserve most derivatives and
            repurchase agreements among themselves. The panel revised formulas for evaluating exposure and used a
            broader definition of capital. Those tweaks spare about $1 trillion in deals at seven of the biggest U.S.
            banks that would have exceeded proposed limits, according to a November study by the Clearing House, an
            industry group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Basel panel of regulators from 27 countries has bowed to industry
            pressure before to weaken new rules. Liquidity standards and leverage ratios also were altered so the
            largest firms came much closer to being in compliance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'That seems to be the name of the game, fighting every rule to the ground,' said Anat Admati, a
            Stanford University finance professor. 'The fact that the banks were so concerned with counterparty limits
            and fought them so hard shows how interconnected they are. That makes them too big to fail.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>John Stafford, Who Led Wyeth in Merger Quest, Dies at 76</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;John Stafford, the chief executive
            officer of American Home Products Corp. who sold units to focus
            on pharmaceuticals and made three attempts to merge before
            changing the company's name to Wyeth, has died. He was 76. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He died on April 18 at his home in Essex Fells, New Jersey,
            where he had lived since 1976, Carolyn Stafford Stein, his
            daughter, said today in a telephone interview. The cause of
            death was prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stafford, who was CEO from 1986 to 2001 and chairman from
            1986 to 2002, boosted investment and research in American Home's
            pharmaceuticals division while spinning off non-related units,
            such as Brach's candy, household goods and agricultural
            chemicals. With brands such as Anacin aspirin, Dristan cold
            medicine and Premarin estrogen treatment, then the most-prescribed drug in the U.S., annual revenue almost
            tripled to
            $14.6 billion under his leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former lawyer also courted SmithKline Beecham Plc and
            Monsanto Co. in failed merger attempts before a $58 billion deal
            with Warner-Lambert Co. to create the world's largest drugmaker
            fell apart in 2000 in a takeover battle won by Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
            Stafford also presided over the $9.7 billion acquisition of
            American Cyanamid Co. in 1994 that included its Lederle
            Laboratories unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2002, American Home changed its name to Wyeth, which was
            bought by Pfizer seven years later. By the time he stepped down
            as CEO, the shares had increased sixfold during his tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Stafford is credited with moving American Home Products
            from a diversified manufacturer of consumer health products into
            a major pharmaceutical company,' according to a Harvard
            Business School profile. 'He did so while consistently
            achieving impressive financial returns.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American Home's attempts to merge with Warner-Lambert, the
            maker of the cholesterol treatment Lipitor, followed its removal
            of two diet pills and one painkiller from the market and a $3.75
            billion settlement of diet-pill litigation in 2000. Warner-Lambert was purchased by Pfizer in a hostile
            takeover that left
            American Home with a breakup fee of $1.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've made it on our own since 1926,' Stafford said in a
            March 2000 interview with the New York Times after losing the
            bid for Warner-Lambert. 'We're in a better position now than
            we've been in sometime in terms of our pipeline and balance
            sheet. There is no question that we can compete.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Settlement Reserve &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawsuits over the diet drugs, known as fen-phen and
            recalled in 1997, led to the settlement reserve being increased
            to $21 billion after Stafford's retirement. Former users of the
            appetite suppressants claimed the pills caused an often-fatal
            lung disease and that the company hid the health risks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Rogers Stafford was born on Oct. 24, 1937, in
            Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. His father, Paul Stafford, was a civil
            engineer, and his mother, Gladys Sharp, was a homemaker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He attended Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
            before earning a law degree at George Washington University, in
            Washington, D.C., where he edited the law review. Stafford then
            practiced law for four years at the Washington-based firm
            Steptoe Johnson before joining the health-care company
            Hoffmann-La Roche in Nutley, New Jersey, as a lawyer in 1966. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1970, Stafford moved to American Home Products as
            general counsel and was named vice president two years later. He
            became a director in 1980 and president the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Employee Care &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He was tremendously proud, and rightfully so, with what
            he could do with AHP,' his daughter said. 'The way they tried
            to take care of their employees was one thing he was
            particularly proud of.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under Stafford, American Home moved its headquarters in the
            early-1990s from midtown Manhattan to Madison, New Jersey, where
            it built a child-care center and gymnasium on site for
            employees. Workers were also granted equal time off for adoption
            as for maternity leave, his daughter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1959, Stafford married the former Inge Paul, a
            psychologist, whom he met at Dickinson College. She died in
            April 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His survivors include their four daughters, Carolyn Stein,
            Jennifer Farrow, Christina Chapin and Charlotte Stafford; 13
            grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. He also is survived
            by a brother, P. Gordon Stafford. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Walter Says Initial Results Show Its Nominees Were Elected</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) investors
            rejected five nominees to its board proposed by activist
            shareholder Audley Capital Advisors LLP, according to
            preliminary results from Walter's shareholder meeting today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The results indicate that all of Walter's nominees were
            elected, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said today in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Audley had called on the producer of metallurgical coal to
            reduce debt and corporate expenses to boost profit. It was the
            second attempt by London-based Audley's co-founder and Managing
            Partner Julian Treger to compel change at Walter, which has
            posted two consecutive quarterly losses and seen its shares drop
            73 percent in the past year. Walter rose 0.9 percent to $17.98
            in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our campaign was critically important and highlighted the
            issues facing the company, stimulated dialogue with stockholders
            and has already resulted in some improvements at Walter,'
            Treger said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Rise Amid Jobless Claims, Earnings Reports</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, extending a rally
            in the Standard Poor's 500 Index to a fifth day, as earnings
            from United Parcel Services Inc. to Cliffs Natural Resources
            Inc. topped estimates and jobless claims fell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural soared 15 percent and UPS climbed 2.3
            percent. Akamai (AKAM) Technologies Inc. rose 18 percent as revenue and
            profit beat estimates. 3M Co. (MMM) slid 2.8 percent as profit trailed
            forecasts and the company cut its full-year outlook amid a
            slowing global economy. Qualcomm Inc. lost 5.4 percent after
            forecasting profit that may miss some analysts' projections. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 (SPX) advanced 0.4 percent to 1,585.16 in New York.
            The gauge has risen 2.8 percent since April 18. The Dow Jones
            Industrial Average climbed 24.50 points, or 0.2 percent, to
            14,700.80 today. Almost 6.8 billion shares traded hands today,
            or 6 percent more than the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The majority of companies are continuing to beat
            expectations, so that's a good sign,' Peter Jankovskis, who
            helps oversee $3 billion as co-chief investment officer of
            Lisle, Illinois-based Oakbrook Investments LLC, said by
            telephone. 'The jobless claims were better-than-expected, so
            that's providing some support.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some 59 SP 500 companies post earnings today. Of the 237
            index members that have published results so far in this
            reporting season, 73 percent have exceeded analysts' earnings
            estimates while 56 percent missed on revenue, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Profit at SP 500 companies dropped 1.1 percent in the
            first three months of the year, according to analyst forecasts
            compiled by Bloomberg. That would mark the first year-over-year
            decrease since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Jobless Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Applications for jobless benefits fell by 16,000 to 339,000
            in the week ended April 20, according to Labor Department data
            released today in Washington. Economists in a Bloomberg survey
            had a median estimate of 350,000 claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.K., the economy grew 0.3 percent in the first
            quarter, more than economists forecast, avoiding a triple-dip
            recession. Twenty-four of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
            expect the European Central Bank to cut its benchmark interest
            rate by a quarter percentage point to 0.5 percent next week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has surged 134 percent from a 12-year low in
            2009 as corporate earnings beat analyst estimates and the
            Federal Reserve embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to
            spur economic growth. The benchmark gauge is within eight points
            of an all-time high of 1,593.37 reached on April 11. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Debate Shifting &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central bank policy makers have been voicing support for
            extending record stimulus as inflation cools and 11.7 million
            Americans remain jobless. That marks a shift from last month's
            meeting, when the bankers debated the timing of a possible
            reduction in bond buying. The Federal Open Market Committee will
            meet April 30-May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market is really looking at continued easing by the
            Fed,' Greg Woodard, a portfolio strategist at Manning Napier
            in Fairport, New York, said by phone. His firm had $45.2 billion
            under management at the end of 2012. 'They're looking for
            signals of when the Fed is going to start to reverse that. Our
            view is that probably it's going to be some time away.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), or
            VIX, increased 0.1 percent to 13.62. The CBOE opened for trading
            three-and-a-half hours late today after a problem with its
            computer systems shut the derivatives market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nine out of 10 industries in the SP 500 advanced as phone
            and raw-materials companies climbed the most, rising at least 1
            percent. Energy companies slumped 0.2 percent as a group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cliffs Natural &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cliffs Natural jumped the most in four years, adding 15
            percent to $20.95. The largest U.S. iron-ore producer idled some
            mines to reduce operating costs in the first quarter and
            adjusted earnings beat analysts' forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UPS climbed 2.3 percent to $85.42. The world's largest
            package-delivery company posted higher first-quarter earnings
            than analysts estimated as deliveries of online purchases
            increased. The company handles more than 16 million packages and
            envelopes a day worldwide, making it a bellwether for the
            economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Akamai, which helps customers deliver online content
            faster, had the biggest gain in the SP 500. The stock surged 18
            percent to $42.48 after the company reported first-quarter
            revenue and profit that topped estimates as Internet traffic
            increased more than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An index of homebuilders climbed 2.5 percent as all of its
            11 members gained. PulteGroup Inc. jumped 5.6 percent to $20.79.
            The largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue reported earnings that
            beat analyst estimates as an accelerating housing recovery
            fueled sales and led to higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dow Chemical &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical (DOW) Co. advanced 5.6 percent to $33.97. The
            largest U.S. chemical maker by sales posted first-quarter profit
            that beat analysts' estimates as lower prices for natural gas
            increased earnings from plastics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Biogen Idec Inc. added 4.8 percent to $216. The fourth-
            largest U.S. biotechnology company by market value raised its
            full-year forecast as first-quarter net income increased on a
            tax benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regeneron (REGN) Pharmaceuticals Inc. advanced 2.9 percent to
            $216.75. The maker of the eye medicine Eylea will replace
            MetroPCS Communications Inc. in the SP 500 after the close of
            trading on April 30, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3M fell 2.8 percent, the steepest decline since October, to
            $104.88. The maker of products ranging from Scotch tape to
            dental braces reduced its annual earnings forecast after
            quarterly profit trailed estimates for the first time in 1 1/2
            years amid a slowing global economy. The company, which made 65
            percent of 2012 revenue outside the U.S., gets fewer dollars
            when converting sales from countries with weaker currencies into
            its results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Qualcomm, Exxon &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm (QCOM) lost 5.4 percent to $62.44. The biggest seller of
            semiconductors for mobile phones forecast fiscal third-quarter
            net income of 80 cents to 88 cents a share as average phone
            prices come under pressure. Analysts on average had projected
            earnings of 87 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. slipped 1.5 percent to $88.07, halting a
            five-day gain of 3.9 percent. The world's largest company by
            market value said sales fell 12 percent to $108.8 billion in the
            first quarter. Widening chemical margins made up for lower crude
            production and prices, helping Exxon post an unexpected profit
            increase. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Intuit (INTU) Inc. slid 11 percent to $57.09. The maker of tax and
            financial-planning software cut its full-year earnings forecast.
            JPMorgan Chase Co. downgraded the shares to neutral from
            overweight, the equivalent of a buy rating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Safeway Inc. tumbled 14 percent, the most since 2003, to
            $24.32 after the grocer reported first-quarter same-store sales
            that were lower than it previously estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zynga Inc. sank 6.5 percent to $3.13. The biggest maker of
            online social games forecast second-quarter sales that may fall
            short of some analysts' estimates as revenue from mobile titles
            fails to make up for a drop in users playing its games on
            Facebook Inc.'s website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Gain as Selloff Fades in Internet, Small-Caps</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) erasing an earlier slide, as Internet
            and smaller companies pulled back from a selloff amid optimism over merger activity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer
            Inc. added 4.2 percent after proposing to buy AstraZeneca Plc for about 58.8 billion pounds ($98.7 billion).
            Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. rallied more than 2.4 percent, leading gains among the largest technology
            companies. Bank of America Corp. dropped 6.3 percent after suspending its planned buybacks and dividend
            increase because of an error in its capital planning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.3 percent to
            1,869.43 at 4 p.m. in New York, reversing an earlier loss of 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
            increased 87.28 points, or 0.5 percent, to 16,448.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) declined less than
            0.1 percent after tumbling as much as 1.5 percent, and the Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies slid 0.5
            percent. About 7.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 9.3 percent above the three-month
            average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's remarkable how volatile the market can be on an intraday basis,' John
            Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management Inc., which oversees $220 billion
            worldwide, said by phone. 'Most of the companies that have reported so far have exceeded expectations and
            there's MA that's bubbling along and that could be causing some optimism, with big deals and restructuring.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. equities began higher as large companies rallied on optimism about merger activity.
            Stocks turned lower as the U.S. and European Union imposed new sanctions on Russia, while selling in
            Internet and small-cap stocks spread to the broader market. Major indexes recovered in the afternoon,
            turning positive during the final hour of trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Technology Selloff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Nasdaq Composite declined 0.5 percent last week, including a 1.8 percent tumble on April 25, as
            disappointing results from Amazon.com Inc. triggered a selloff in technology shares and tensions over
            Ukraine intensified. The technology-heavy gauge has fallen in four of the past five weeks amid concern
            valuations have outpaced estimates for earnings growth. Nasdaq companies trade at 34 times reported
            earnings, about double the level of SP 500 members. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The frequency of selloffs has
            increased even as technology makers are forecast to post the second-fastest profit growth in the SP 500 this
            year and members of the Nasdaq 100 Index are beating analyst estimates by almost 10 percent this earnings
            season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, IBM &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increases among larger stocks helped push
            technology companies in the SP 500 higher as a group. Microsoft surged 2.4 percent to $40.87 and Apple
            climbed 3.9 percent to $594.09 to extend its three-day rally to 13 percent, the most since 2009.
            International Business Machines Corp. added 1.9 percent to $193.14. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones
            Internet Index (VIX) fell 1.9 percent, extending a 4.1 percent decline on April 25. The index has dropped 18
            percent from a 13-year high on March 5. Only four of 41 members in the gauge rose today. Yahoo! Inc. dropped
            1.4 percent to $33.99. Amazon slumped 2.4 percent to $296.58. Netflix tumbled 2.4 percent to $314.21. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A report by the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase previously owned U.S.
            homes climbed in March by the most in almost three years, showing residential real estate was starting to
            stabilize entering the spring selling season. The pending home sales index rose 3.4 percent, the first gain
            in nine months, after a 0.5 percent drop in February that was smaller than initially reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Data &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A busy calendar this week will give investors more clues about
            the strength of the economy and the pace of the Federal Reserve's stimulus program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            government's initial tally of first-quarter gross domestic product on April 30 may show the slowest
            expansion in a year. Federal Reserve policy makers, who on the same day conclude their third meeting of the
            year, will probably reduce the pace of assets purchases designed to stoke the economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three
            rounds of monetary stimulus have helped fuel economic growth, sending the SP 500 surging as much as 180
            percent from its 2009 low. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Payroll growth probably accelerated in April as companies
            remained upbeat about the economy's prospects after a setback in demand caused by snowstorms and colder
            temperatures earlier this year. Employers added 215,000 workers, the most since November, economists project
            a May 2 report from the Labor Department will show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ukraine Crisis &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors
            are also watching developments in Ukraine. The Obama administration imposed sanctions on seven Russian
            officials and 17 companies linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle involved in banking,
            energy and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sanctions, announced by the White House today, are being
            imposed in conjunction with the European Union, which said today it is adding 15 names to its list of
            previously sanctioned individuals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index,
            a gauge of options prices on the SP 500, dropped 0.6 percent for its first loss in four days. The gauge
            jumped 5.6 percent on April 25. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumer-staples and phone companies had the biggest
            gains among 10 groups in the SP 500, climbing more than 1.1 percent. Financial and raw-materials shares
            declined the most, dropping at least 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer, GE &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer
            added 4.2 percent to $32.04. The world's largest drugmaker is still interested in a deal after AstraZeneca
            spurned its earlier offer. Pfizer proposed buying the London-based company on Jan. 5 for 46.61 pounds a
            share in cash and stock, and AstraZeneca declined to pursue negotiations, the New York-based company said in
            a statement today. The bid was about 14 percent above AstraZeneca's closing price on April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. gained 0.7 percent to $26.78 after Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt met
            with France's President Francois Hollande over the company's offer for Alstom SA. Immelt may be moving
            closer to pulling off his largest-ever acquisition, even after French officials over the weekend urged
            Alstom to consider a rival offer from Germany's Siemens AG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government doesn't
            oppose GE's proposal, and the meeting in Paris today focused on protecting jobs and maintaining the
            independence of France's nuclear industry, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. The
            state doesn't favor either bid, the person said, asking not to be named as the talks weren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Newmont, Barrick &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. soared 7.3 percent to a
            record $17.20. American Realty Capital Properties Inc., the largest owner of single-tenant U.S. buildings,
            is interested in acquiring NorthStar for about $20 a share, according to a person with knowledge of the
            matter. That's a premium of 25 percent to NorthStar's closing price of $16.03 last week and would value the
            New York-based company at about $6.5 billion. American Realty fell 3 percent to $12.62. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Newmont
            Mining Corp. dropped 6.7 percent to $24.67. Barrick Gold Corp. said Newmont ended discussions about a
            takeover, which would have combined the world's two largest gold producers. Talks between Newmont and
            Toronto-based Barrick broke down on April 18 over a disagreement about a proposed spinoff of some of the
            combined company's assets, people familiar with the situation said the following day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank
            of America lost 6.3 percent to $14.95. The bank said it will suspend its planned buybacks and dividend
            increase because of an error in its capital planning. The lender will resubmit its proposal to the Federal
            Reserve, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said in a statement. The company said it incorrectly
            adjusted for cumulative realized losses on structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>J.C. Penney's CEO Using Loan to Price Hikes in Turnaround</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) Chief Executive
            Officer Myron Ullman received a $1.75 billion loan commitment
            from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and has been raising some prices
            as he works to stanch the retailer's cash drain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five-year term loan will be secured by real estate and
            an interest in other assets of the retailer, Plano, Texas-based
            J.C. Penney said today in a statement. The proceeds will be used
            for working capital and to discharge the company's 7.125 percent
            notes due in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ullman has focused on shoring up the company's finances
            since replacing Ron Johnson three weeks ago and started by
            drawing $850 million from its credit line on April 15. He's also
            reversing Johnson's avoidance of promotions and is raising some
            prices more than 50 percent while dropping some back down later
            to give the appearance of a discount, according to a study today
            from JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The loan takes 'liquidity concerns off the table for at
            least two or three years,' Alex Fuhrman, an analyst for Piper
            Jaffray Cos. in New York, wrote in a note today. While the
            prospects of a default before the company's next debt payment in
            2015 are now remote, the loan won't mitigate the cash
            consumption Piper Jaffray expects to reach $1 billion in the
            first quarter, Fuhrman said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rangers Says Walter Smith Resigns as Chairman Immediately</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walter Smith, who won 21 trophies in
            two spells as manager of Rangers Football Club, has resigned as
            chairman of the Scottish soccer club with immediate effect, the
            Glasgow-based club said in a statement to the Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith quit after a period of in-fighting at the club, the
            British Broadcasting Corporation said, without saying where it
            got the information. Smith, appointed as chairman in May, is
            expected to make a statement about his reasons for leaving, the
            BBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith's resignation came hours after Chief Executive
            Officer Craig Mather said calls for his own departure were ill-timed and ill-informed, the BBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Green, a former CEO who led the rescue of the club
            last year after it went into administration, has returned to the

        <headline>JPMorgan Sued With Goldman in Aluminum Antitrust Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, was sued with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Glencore
            Xstrata Plc (GLEN) over claims they restrained aluminum supplies and
            drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed by a Jacksonville, Florida, direct
            purchaser, Master Screens Inc., and by individual plaintiff
            Daniel Price Bart of Tallahassee, who is described in the filing
            as a 'purchaser of beverages sold in aluminum cans.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks and Glencore are accused in the complaint filed
            yesterday in federal court in Tallahassee of racketeering and
            conspiring with the London Metal Exchange, hoarding aluminum in
            Detroit-area warehouses and violating federal antitrust laws.
            Goldman Sachs was first sued over similar claims by a Michigan
            company on Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By inserting itself into a healthy industry producing
            widely needed commodities, severely degrading functionality and
            widely distributing costs while itself benefiting, Goldman Sachs
            and JPMorgan couldn't fit a more archetypal description of a
            parasite on the markets,' according to the Florida complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are no queues at our warehouses and we believe this
            suit has no merit,' Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
            vigorously contest it,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New
            York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. 'We also note that
            aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Warehousing 'Giant' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 1 million tons of aluminum are stored in the
            Detroit warehouses, many of which are owned by Goldman Sachs,
            which charges rent for the storage, according to the complaint,
            while London Metal Exchange load-out rules curtail how much of
            the metal leaves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan-owned Henry Bath Son Ltd., acquired in 2010, is
            described in the complaint as a 'metal warehousing giant.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Florida plaintiffs are seeking class action, or group,
            status, to represent other aluminum buyers and consumers, as
            well as compensatory damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
            commodities group Glencore, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DuVally last week said the complaint filed against Goldman
            Sachs in Detroit was without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A third lawsuit, naming as defendants Goldman Sachs and its
            warehouse unit, Metro International Trade Services LLC, as
            defendants, was filed yesterday in federal court in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaintiff River Parish Contractors Inc. of Reserve,
            Louisiana, also alleges the Goldman Sachs entities inflated
            aluminum prices and restrained supplies in violation of U.S.
            antitrust laws. Neither London Metal Exchange nor JPMorgan are
            named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Florida case is Master Screens Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., 13-cv-00431, U.S. District Court, Northern District
            of Florida (Tallahassee). The Michigan case is Superior
            Extrusion Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 13-cv-13315, U.S.
            District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). The
            Louisiana case is River Parish Contractors Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., 13-cv-05267, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
            of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;G. Robert Blakey, the law professor
            who helped draft the U.S. wiretap statute, may submit a brief
            supporting imprisoned hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam's effort
            to overturn his conviction for insider trading, a U.S. appeals
            court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blakey, who teaches at Notre Dame Law School in Indiana,
            supports a rehearing of the case against the Galleon Group LLC
            co-founder, whose conviction was upheld in June by the appeals
            court in New York. He was granted the right to submit written
            arguments yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who's serving an 11-year term at the Federal
            Medical Center Devens in Ayers, Massachusetts, on July 24 asked
            for a hearing before the full U.S. Court of Appeals in New York.
            His conviction was upheld by a three-judge panel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 56, was convicted of directing the biggest
            hedge fund insider-trading scheme in U.S. history. It was the
            first such case in which investigators tapped targets' phone
            conversations, a tactic used in organized-crime probes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jurors listened to more than 45 wiretap recordings, on some
            of which Rajaratnam can be heard gathering nonpublic information
            from his sources. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blakely, who is viewed as the architect of the wiretap
            statute, called the secret recordings 'a method of last
            resort' in court papers submitted with his request to file the
            brief on Rajaratnam's behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeal is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 11-04416, U.S. Court of
            Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;SP Said to Face SEC Probe on 2011 Commercial-Mortgage Bond &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Poor's is facing scrutiny from the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission for how it rated a
            commercial-mortgage bond in 2011, three people with knowledge of
            the matter, but who weren't authorized to speak publicly, said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The inquiry extends beyond a U.S. Justice Department
            lawsuit against New York-based McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) and
            its SP unit. Massachusetts has also looked into SP's post-crisis methods, Bloomberg News reported Feb. 21.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We reviewed the application of our CMBS methodology and
            determined that the approach used for new transactions rated in
            2011 produced results that were consistent with Standard
            Poor's rating definitions and resulted in no ratings changes,'
            Ed Sweeney, an SP spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Nester, an SEC spokesman in Washington, declined to
            comment on whether the agency was scrutinizing the deal, which
            was first reported by Dow Jones Newswires. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department sued SP Feb. 4 in federal court in
            Los Angeles, accusing the company of inflating ratings to win
            business on bonds backed by home loans made to the riskiest
            borrowers from September 2004 to October 2007. The U.S. is
            seeking more than $5 billion in damages, or more than five years
            of profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP denies the allegations and said in a Feb. 5 statement
            it will defend itself 'vigorously.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-Baker McKenzie Partner Sentenced to 2 Years for Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former Baker McKenzie LLP partner Martin Weisberg, who
            admitted to stealing from a client and taking part in a $55
            million securities fraud, was sentenced to two years in prison,
            the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weisberg, 62, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and money
            laundering in May 2012 after prosecutors alleged he skimmed $1.3
            million in interest from an escrow account for a hedge fund
            client, SIAM Capital Management. Separately, Weisberg joined a
            scheme to manipulate the stock price of technology firms
            Xybernaut Corp. and Ramp Corp. prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Instead of using his talents to provide wise counsel, he
            lied to and stole from his own clients, lied to the Securities
            and Exchange Commission, and betrayed the investing public,'
            Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New
            York, also ordered Weisberg to pay $297,500 in restitution and
            $250,000 in forfeiture, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weisberg left Baker McKenzie in October 2007 at the time
            of his arrest in the securities case. Previously, he had worked
            at firms including Cravath, Swaine Moore LLP, Morgan Lewis
            Bockius, and Shea Gould, according to a memorandum filed by
            his lawyers in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Albert, a lawyer for Weisberg, declined to comment
            on the sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Saltsman, 07-cr-641, U.S. District
            Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Faces Criminal Probe as Bank Says U.S. Faults MBS Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, said it's
            under both civil and criminal investigation for practices tied
            to sales of mortgage-backed bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department's civil division told the bank in
            May of its preliminary finding after examining securities tied
            to subprime and Alt-A loans, which were sold to investors from
            2005 through 2007, JPMorgan said Aug. 7. The office of U.S.
            Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento, California, has been
            conducting civil and criminal inquiries, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would be a major decision for them to indict a major
            U.S. bank, and frankly I would not predict it,' said John
            Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. 'You
            can often bring dual investigations, civil and criminal, in
            order to maximize pressure for a global civil resolution.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigators are seeking to wrap up years-long probes of
            abuses that fueled the housing collapse and led global credit
            markets to freeze in 2008. This week, the Justice Department and
            Securities and Exchange Commission sued Bank of America Corp.,
            the nation's second-biggest lender, accusing it of misleading
            investors in an $850 million mortgage-backed bond. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is investigating JPMorgan under the Financial
            Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, according to
            a person briefed on the matter, requesting anonymity because
            details of the inquiry aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1989 law, known as FIRREA, allows the government to
            seek civil penalties for losses to federally insured financial
            firms. The Bank of America case cited the same statute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman for Wagner in Sacramento,
            declined to comment on the bank's disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan 'continues to respond to other MBS-related
            regulatory inquiries,' the New York-based company wrote in a
            regulatory filing listing investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
            Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America has said buyers
            of its mortgage bonds were sophisticated investors with ample
            access to underlying data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors are reluctant to bring criminal charges
            against a large bank that's tightly interconnected with other
            firms because it could endanger national or global economies,
            U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told a Senate Judiciary
            Committee hearing in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Cooperating With U.S. Credit Derivatives Inquiry &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., the fifth-largest U.S. bank by
            assets, said it's cooperating with the U.S. Department of
            Justice's four-year-old antitrust probe into the credit-default
            swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm has received civil investigative demands related
            to the investigation, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
            regulatory filing today. The bank was among more than a dozen
            financial institutions accused by the European Union last month
            of colluding to curb competition in credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. also said in filings last
            week that they were cooperating with the probe. The Justice
            Department sent civil investigative notices in July 2009 to the
            banks that own London-based Markit Group Ltd., a provider of
            data on derivatives and bonds, to find out if they had unfair
            access to price information, three people familiar with the
            matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markit's shareholders included Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
            Chase Co., Bank of America Corp., and Royal Bank of Scotland
            Group Plc, according to filings with the U.K.'s Companies House
            at the time. Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News, competes
            with Markit in selling information to the financial-services
            industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MetLife Says Bank May Face Fine as U.S. Probes Foreclosures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc. (MET), the largest U.S. life insurer, said it may
            face fines amid a government review of foreclosures at its bank
            unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank received a request in May from the U.S. Department
            of Justice for information on payments the lender made to law
            firms tied to foreclosures, the New York-based insurer said in a
            filing yesterday. Expenses were submitted to Fannie Mae (FNMA), Freddie
            Mac (FMCC) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for
            reimbursement, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is possible that various state or federal regulatory
            and law enforcement authorities may seek monetary penalties from
            MetLife Bank relating to foreclosure practices,' the insurer
            said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The probe adds to U.S. scrutiny of a business that MetLife
            has been exiting as it seeks to focus on insurance and
            retirement products. The company said last year that the Justice
            Department, led by Attorney General Eric Holder, made a civil
            investigative demand in a review of mortgages insured by the
            Federal Housing Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Calagna, a spokesman for MetLife, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAC's Cohen Shouldn't Get Evidence in SEC Case, Prosecutor Says &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAC Capital Advisors LP founder Steven A. Cohen shouldn't
            get evidence in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            administrative proceeding until criminal cases tied to his hedge
            fund conclude, a prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohen, the billionaire founder of Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC, was accused July 19 in an
            administrative action of
            failing to supervise two employees facing criminal charges of
            insider trading. On July 25, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet
            Bharara indicted SAC and filed a separate money-laundering
            lawsuit against the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged Cohen, 57, received 'highly suspicious'
            information that should have caused any reasonable hedge-fund
            manager to investigate the basis for trades. Prosecutors said
            the fund reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit
            profit from insider-trading schemes involving at least eight
            employees including the two facing charges, former SAC fund
            manager Mathew Martoma and Michael Steinberg, a fund manager at
            SAC's Sigma Capital unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Cohen doesn't oppose the request to postpone the SEC
            case, he asked to be given prompt access to the agency's
            investigative records. His lawyers said he would be 'severely
            prejudiced' with 'insufficient time' to adequately review the
            vast number of documents collected by the SEC, which outnumber
            those in prosecutors' custody. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Both arguments are incorrect,' Assistant U.S. Attorney
            Antonia Apps, who is prosecuting SAC and Steinberg, said in a
            memo filed yesterday in the SEC case. 'The U.S. Attorney
            respectfully submits that the public interest would best be
            served by staying the administrative proceeding pending
            prosecution of the related criminal cases.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen
            Co., declined to comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-cr-00541;
            U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP 13-cv-05182, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
            administrative proceeding is In the matter of Steven A. Cohen,
            3015382, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Obama Says Private Capital Should Take Lead Mortgage Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama is calling for private capital to
            take the lead role in the nation's mortgage market with the U.S.
            government continuing to provide a backstop only against
            catastrophic risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The president for the first time is endorsing an approach
            to remake the housing finance system as Fannie Mae and Freddie
            Mac are wound down. He said the government still must play a
            role to preserve broad access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages
            that underpin the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You can't have a situation in which the government is
            underwriting and guaranteeing all the mortgage lending that's
            taking place around the country and big profits are being made
            by these quasi-private institutions,' Obama said. Congress
            should pass housing legislation by the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The president's remarks yesterday came during a question
            and answer session in Los Angeles moderated by Spencer Rascoff,
            chief executive officer of Zillow Inc (Z), operator of the largest
            real-estate information website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A reduced government role would likely mean that mortgages
            would become more expensive as the costs of covering risk are
            shifted from taxpayers to borrowers. A Senate bill containing
            Obama's approach would increase interest rates by between 50 and
            75 basis points for a typical borrower with a 30-year fixed rate
            loan, a 20 percent down payment, and a 750 credit score,
            according to a report by Moody's Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Concessions Seen in Telefonica-KPN German Merger for EU Nod &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Telefonica SA (TEF) and Royal KPN NV (KPN)'s bid to combine their
            German assets has become an acid test for a telecommunications
            industry anxious over whether regulators will allow deals
            carriers say they need to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Already Germany's phone regulator has given Telefonica's O2
            and KPN's E-Plus units two weeks to turn over details of
            wireless frequencies so it can determine they'd be 'efficiently
            used,' and that the merger won't hamper competition, according
            to a July 25 letter from the Bonn-based agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The letter raised the prospect of a surrender of some
            airwaves, which could water down the benefits of the 8.1
            billion-euro ($10.8 billion) transaction and by extension
            inhibit other carriers from attempting similar consolidation
            moves, which regulators have said are key to rationalizing the
            28-nation European Union market. Approval of the deal will
            probably come with conditions such as asset disposals, according
            to competition lawyer Paul Hughes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You're looking at a reduction in the big players from
            four to three,' said Hughes, European competition counsel at
            Steptoe Johnson LLP in Brussels. 'No doubt, there will be
            remedies required in the form of making available access to
            wholesale network for virtual mobile telephony companies, for
            making spectrum available to other players.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU telecommunications market is inundated with carriers
            spread over 28 countries. That creates a sevenfold difference in
            the price of a domestic mobile call between the priciest and
            cheapest markets across a region less than half the size of the
            U.S., according to a statement Aug. 6 from Neelie Kroes, who is
            in charge of the digital agenda for the European Commission, the
            EU's executive arm in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Sued With Goldman Sachs in Aluminum Antitrust Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, was sued with
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) over claims
            they restrained aluminum supplies and drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed by a Jacksonville, Florida, direct
            purchaser, Master Screens Inc., and by individual plaintiff
            Daniel Price Bart of Tallahassee, who is described in the filing
            as a 'purchaser of beverages sold in aluminum cans.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks and Glencore are accused in the complaint filed
            yesterday in federal court in Tallahassee of racketeering and
            conspiring with the London Metal Exchange, hoarding aluminum in
            Detroit-area warehouses and violating federal antitrust laws.
            Goldman Sachs was first sued over similar claims by a Michigan
            company on Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are no queues at our warehouses and we believe this
            suit has no merit,' Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
            vigorously contest it,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New
            York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. 'We also note that
            aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
            commodities group Glencore, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Florida case is Master Screens Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., 13-cv-00431, U.S. District Court, Northern District
            of Florida (Tallahassee). The Michigan case is Superior
            Extrusion Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 13-cv-13315, U.S.
            District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). The
            Louisiana case is River Parish Contractors Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., 13-cv-05267, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
            of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nuveen Funds Sue AIG, Executives Claiming Securities Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five Nuveen Investments Inc. funds sued American
            International Group Inc. (AIG), claiming the company and executives
            committed securities fraud leading to the U.S. financial crisis
            that intensified in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Also named Aug. 6 as defendants in a 237-page complaint in
            federal court in Chicago were former Chief Executive Officer
            Martin J. Sullivan, ex-Chief Financial Officer Steven Bensinger
            and Joseph Cassano, who led the AIG Financial Products unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Plaintiffs suffered tens of billions of dollars in
            losses, at least, based on false and materially misleading
            statements that AIG, certain of its executives, directors,
            underwriters and outside auditor made,' according to the
            complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The funds accused the company, Sullivan and others of
            violating Illinois and federal securities laws, common law fraud
            and unjust enrichment. They asked for unspecified money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matthew Gallagher, a spokesman for New York-based AIG,
            declined to comment immediately on the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the Nuveen funds suing the insurer are the Dow 30
            Enhanced Premium and Income Fund, the Nuveen Equity Premium
            Opportunity Fund (JSN) and the Nuveen Large Cap Value Fund. (NNGAX) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Dow 30 Enhanced Premium Income Fund v.
            American International Group Inc., 13-cv-05612, U.S. District
            Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Publishers Object to U.S. Request in Apple E-Book Pricing Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Publishers who previously settled an antitrust lawsuit with
            the U.S. Justice Department over pricing of electronic books
            filed an objection to the government's bid to force Apple Inc. (AAPL)
            to terminate existing contracts with them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HarperCollins Publishers LLC, Hachette Book Group Inc.,
            Simon Schuster Inc. and two others claimed in the objection
            yesterday that they would be punished by the proposed order. The
            government's proposal would force Apple to find new ways of
            making deals with publishers to distribute e-books. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposal would 'effectively eliminate the use of the
            agency model' for selling and distributing e-books for a period
            of five years, the publishers said in the filing in federal
            court in Manhattan. Under the agency model, publishers, not
            retailers, set book prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The provisions do not impose any limitation on Apple's
            pricing behavior at all,' lawyers for the publishers wrote.
            'Rather, under the guise of punishing Apple, they effectively
            punish the settling defendants by prohibiting agreements with
            Apple using an agency model.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote ruled in July that
            Cupertino, California-based Apple, the world's largest
            technology company, violated U.S. antitrust law by fixing e-book
            prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five publishers were also defendants in the lawsuit,
            which was brought by the U.S. government and 33 state attorneys
            general. The publishers, Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck
            GmbH's Macmillan unit, CBS Corp. (CBS)'s Simon Schuster, Lagardere
            SCA (MMB)'s Hachette Book Group, Pearson Plc (PSON)'s Penguin unit and News
            Corp.'s HarperCollins, settled with the government for a total
            of at least $164 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A sixth publisher, Random House Inc., didn't sign an agency
            agreement with Apple and wasn't involved in the U.S. suit.
            Penguin was merged with Random House this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department,
            said in an e-mail that the proposed court order doesn't modify
            the terms of the settlement reached with the publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If approved by the court, the order 'would prohibit Apple
            from entering agreements that limit retail price competition
            during a reset period,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Apple Inc., 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Power Network Draws Rich Families to Chicago Banker Byron'Trott</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Carol Bernick, executive chairman of Alberto-Culver Co., was facing the decision of a lifetime. She
            was going to sell the Melrose Park, Illinois'based shampoo maker her father had started in 1955 or she was
            going to plunge into foreign markets -- Japan and Brazil -- to keep up with competitors. To help make her
            choice, she called just one banker: Byron Trott, chief executive officer and chairman of BDT Capital
            Partners LLC in Chicago, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its September issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More
            from Bloomberg Markets:&lt;/p&gt;
            The Booming Business of Self-Storage
            The Top-Performing Alternative Investments
            &lt;p&gt;Bernick, 62, says she considered Trott a partner in preserving her family's wealth; she'd worked
            with him for two-and-a-half decades as he advanced at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernick
            took Trott's advice and agreed to sell Alberto-Culver to Rotterdam-based Unilever for $3.7 billion in 2010.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Byron helps you think through what's best for the long-term health of your family and
            your company without the pressure or glitz that sometimes comes from the East Coast,' Bernick says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rich Families &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years after leaving Goldman, Trott, 55, is parlaying
            longtime links to the moneyed elite into an investment and advisory firm that specializes in helping rich
            families get richer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BDT -- for Byron David Trott -- plays two roles for its well-heeled
            clients. It provides advice on whether to merge, expand or sell businesses, as it did for Alberto. And it
            raises money from them to invest in other mainly family-led companies, either directly or through BDT's
            private-equity funds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Japan Defense Shares Beats National Benchmark as Abe Beefs Up Military: Chart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Defense-related shares in Japan beat the national benchmark and U.S. peers since Prime Minister
            Shinzo Abe came to power and embarked on a policy to strengthen the military and lower barriers to arms
            exports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY tracks defense gauges for Japanese, American and European
            equities and counterpart geographic benchmarks normalized from Dec. 14, 2012, just before Abe led an
            election victory, through Aug. 18. Goldman Sachs's new Japan defense measure of 20 companies was the biggest
            gainer at 72 percent, with the Topix index next at 60 percent. In each pairing, the aerospace-military group
            beat the broader index, which also included the Standard Poor's 500 and FTSE Eurotop 100. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Since
            we expect the defense theme to become a long-term secular theme in the Japanese market, we see scope for
            improved relative performance ahead for related stocks,' Goldman Sachs analysts led by Chief Japan Equity
            Strategist Kathy Matsui said last week in a research note to unveil the gauge. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
            Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. are among the component stocks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boosting
            Japan's military capabilities has been one of the focuses of the Abe government, amid a territorial dispute
            with an increasingly assertive China. In 2013 Abe increased the defense budget for the first time in 11
            years, and this year relaxed an effective ban on defense exports. Even with the changes, defense spending
            will account for less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 4 percent in the U.S. and 1.3
            percent in China, according to estimates by Japan's Ministry of Defense. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Argentine Bond Swap More Dream Than Real for KBC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's plan to pay holders of foreign bonds from local accounts looks doomed to fail even
            before it gets off the ground given concern that investors who participate could be held in contempt of a
            U.S. court ruling, according to KBC Asset Management SAD and JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This
            might be a dream for Argentina,' said Olivier De Timmerman, an emerging-market portfolio manager at KBC in
            Luxembourg. 'I am quite doubtful that this will go into something concrete because I don't think current
            holders would like to be in contempt of a U.S. court. This will be a lengthy process and it will be quite
            messy.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bonds fell the most in two weeks today after President Cristina Fernandez de
            Kirchner announced a plan last night that is in direct conflict with orders by U.S. District Judge Thomas
            Griesa that forbid such a transaction. Her proposal, which also would let overseas debt holders swap into
            new dollar-denominated bonds governed by domestic law, aims to sidestep a ruling by Griesa that the nation
            must pay $1.5 billion to holders of debt defaulted on in 2001 or reach a settlement before resuming payments
            on restructured notes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts and investors at BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG,
            JPMorgan, Adelante Asset Management Ltd. and Fideuram Asset Management all cast doubt on the chances of
            success for Fernandez's proposal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Given NY court orders, financial intermediaries with
            U.S. footprints are unlikely to collaborate in the process,' Vladimir Werning, an economist at JPMorgan in
            New York, said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bond Limbo &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country's
            benchmark restructured bonds due in 2033 fell 2.34 cents to 80.4 cents on the dollar as of 4 p.m. in New
            York. The peso weakened 0.5 percent to 8.3233 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holders of Argentina's $30
            billion of overseas bonds have been in limbo since Griesa blocked the nation's attempt to pay $539 million
            in interest due by July 30. His ruling was intended to compel Argentina to negotiate with hedge funds led by
            billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corp. that refused to provide debt relief by swapping bonds
            from the country's 2001 default and successfully sued for full repayment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On June 20,
            Griesa said that the nation is prohibited from paying the overseas bonds in Argentina. Any intermediaries
            assisting in the process could be sued for contempt of court, while investors who aren't able to hold local
            bonds would have to sell their holdings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Terms of the swap probably won't be favorable
            to holders of longer-dated debt, but restructured notes due in 2017 should be 'pretty easy to swap,' said
            Jim Craige, who helps oversee $65 billion of assets at Stone Harbor, including the Argentine notes due in
            2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flouting Orders &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for New
            York-based Elliott, declined to comment. Aurelius Capital Management LP, another plaintiff in the case, said
            Fernandez's proposal is further evidence that the government is choosing to flout the law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They
            have chronically flouted U.S. court orders, lied to our courts, and proclaimed utter disdain for our
            courts,' Aurelius said in a statement. 'These officials are now 'doubling down' on an illicit and failed
            approach.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holders of bonds governed by New York law are unlikely to want to particulate
            in a swap, according to Emanuele Del Monte, who helps oversee $1.7 billion in assets as money manager at
            Fideuram Asset Management in Dublin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The swap that Argentina wants to propose does
            nothing to normalize the relationship between the government and investors,' he said in an e-mail. 'It's
            going to be very difficult to execute the exchange. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SP &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's too
            little information about the swap to know if it's a good deal for bondholders, Gabriel Torres, an analyst at
            Moody's Investors Service, said in a telephone interview. John Piecuch, a spokesman at Standard Poor's,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pollack, a court-appointed mediator for talks between
            Argentina and the holdouts, declined to comment on Argentina's plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S.-based
            investors may be wary of taking part in the swap over concern they will be held in contempt of court,
            according to Casey Reckman, an economist at Credit Suisse. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Economy Minister Axel
            Kicillof said today the bill's main objective is to change the payment location rather than change
            legislation. Bondholders will find ways to receive their money via the account in Buenos Aires, he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''No one's going to have to take a plane,' Kicillof told reporters. 'These days even
            your gas and electricity bills can be paid by the Internet. We're not going to have an influx of bond
            tourists coming to get paid.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Super Bowl Drug and Sex Party Pack Ringleader Pleads Guilty</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The leader of a ring that promised to deliver 'party packs' of sex and drugs around large events in
            the New York area, including the Super Bowl, pleaded guilty to charges that could land her in prison for as
            long as three years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyun Ok Yoon Ung, 41, of Woodbury, New York, was one of 18 people
            arrested in January following an 11-month probe of the ring, which provided prostitutes and cocaine and
            advertised through the Internet, text messages and public access television, New York Attorney General Eric
            Schneiderman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ung pleaded guilty today in state court in Manhattan
            to promoting prostitution in the third degree and faces a prison term of one to three years when she is
            sentenced on Oct. 24, Schneiderman's office said. She also agreed to forfeit more than $700,000 in proceeds
            from the enterprise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Those who poison our communities with drugs and exploit women by
            promoting prostitution will be held accountable,' Schneiderman said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ring sent a
            text message to frequent customers 10 days before the Super Bowl advertising 'new sexy beautiful girls R in
            town waiting for u,' according to Schneiderman's office. It laundered its proceeds through businesses
            including wholesalers of clothing, wigs and beauty supplies, as well as a limousine service, Schneiderman's
            office said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the ring accepted credit cards and made the charges appear as
            payments for legitimate services, Schneiderman said in January. Prostitutes would often charge a customer's
            card repeatedly, when the person was 'impaired,' reaching totals of as much as $10,000 a night, according to
            Schneiderman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;VMware Inc. (VMW) is boosting its push
            into the $440 billion data-center market long-dominated by the
            likes of Microsoft Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and International
            Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Palo Alto, California-based company, which previously
            hasn't had a comprehensive range of tools for data centers, is
            unveiling a new line of all-in-one products and related
            partnerships, aiming to become a bigger player. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The initiatives, being announced today at the VMworld
            conference in San Francisco, position VMware as a provider of
            cloud-computing software for running all the hardware --
            servers, data networks and storage -- needed to operate data
            centers. If successful, the strategy would move VMware further
            away from parent EMC Corp. (EMC), which owns 80 percent of VMware and
            is the world's biggest provider of storage computers. That could
            bolster the case made by Elliott Management Corp. -- which last
            month said it amassed an active stake of more than $1 billion in
            EMC -- that VMware should be spun off. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'VMware's strategy would commoditize some of what EMC
            does,' said Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird Co.
            'Neither one will admit it, but they're heading right at each
            other.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;According to three patent applications published Aug. 21 in
            the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the
            company would use unmanned aerial vehicles to project streams of
            colored light, to support flexible projection screens, or to
            support and manipulate articulated marionettes in the air. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drones would follow predetermined flight paths and
            would have a local controller operating them through a series of

            Angry Birds and would confuse the public, according to
            ChannelNewsAsia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Singapore's registrar of trademarks said that in addition
            to the absence of visual or conceptual similarity between the
            marks, purchasers of Angry Bite products are self-selected and
            likely to exercise care as they select the items they are
            buying, ChannelNewsAsia reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ikea Wins Dismissal of Trademark Suit by Website Operators &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ikea of Sweden AB, the Swedish home-furnishings company,
            persuaded a federal court in Virginia to dismiss a trademark
            case brought by the operators of a website at which people can
            comment about Ikea products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ikeafans Inc. of Colonial Beach, Virginia, brought the suit
            May 20, seeking a declaration it wasn't infringing the Swedish
            company's trademarks. The Virginia company said it has operated
            the www.ikeafans.com website since 2005, and over the years
            enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the giant home furnishings
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After what Ikeafans said was 'years of collaboration and
            cross-marketing' Ikea said in January 2012 it couldn't continue
            to use the name, according to court papers. Ikeafans then sued
            in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Anthony J. Trenga dismissed Ikea on
            Aug. 22 as the defendant in the case. He noted that the Ikeafans
            website does carry ads for home furnishing companies that
            compete with Ikea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Ikeafans Inc. v. Ikea U.S. Inc., 1:14-cv-00584,
            U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Sued for Infringing 'Diet Detective' Mark &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goop Inc., the website promoting a high-end lifestyle and
            owned by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, was sued for trademark
            infringement by the author of a work on diets and fitness. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the New York federal court suit, Charles Platkin of New
            York claims that Goop has infringed his trademark 'The Diet
            Detective', which he registered with the U.S. Patent and
            Trademark Office in 2007. He said Goop used 'Diet Detective'
            without license or permission beginning July 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goop didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Platkin v. Goop Inc., 1:14-cv-06676, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Sirius Says It Didn't Infringe Marketing Firm's Flyer Design &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI), the satellite radio broadcaster,
            denied claims in a copyright suit brought by a direct marketing
            agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chapman Cubine Adams Hussy Inc. filed the suit in
            Alexandria, Virginia, June 25, claiming that the New York-based
            broadcast company infringed a design the agency used for direct-mail marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its response, Sirius denied it had misappropriated the
            Arlington, Virginia-based marketing company's 'UrgentGram'
            design and said it was investigating allegations it had access
            to the design. The broadcaster said the allegedly infringed
            design was functional, not original and in the public domain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Chapman Cubine Adams Hussy Inc. v. Sirius XM
            Holdings Inc., 1:14-cv-00807, U.S. District Court, Eastern
            District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Ozburn-Hessey Logistics Trade Secrets Case Against 721 Fails &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ozburn-Hessey Logistics LLC's trade-secret misappropriation
            claims against 10 former employees and the rival shipping
            logistics company they started was dismissed by a federal judge
            in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company filed the suit in February 2012, claiming that
            the ex-employees who left to form 721 Logistics LLC in Lester,
            Pennsylvania, took trade secrets and were conspiring to compete
            unfairly with their former employer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ozburn-Hessey, based in Brentwood, Tennessee, said the
            purloined proprietary information included client names, product
            and service marketing techniques, customer pricing and discount
            structures, and sales volumes and purchase patterns of the
            company's customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Felipe Restrepo dismissed the case,
            saying Ozburn-Hessey's trade-secret claims didn't qualify as
            such under Pennsylvania law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is no basis in Pennsylvania law for affording
            trade-secret protection to a 'compilation' that exists only in
            the collective consciousness,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He also dismissed the unfair-competition, breach-of-contract and conspiracy claims. The judge did
            reject the
            defendants' bid for attorney fees, saying they failed to state a
            cause for which they could be claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Ozburn-Hessey Logistics LLC v. 721 Logistics
            LLC, 12-cv-00864, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
            Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Capital Plans Clear Fed Review</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the world's biggest trading firms, had their
            revised capital plans for 2013 cleared by the Federal Reserve
            yesterday, a month before next year's submissions are required. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Fed didn't object to the banks' proposals in
            March, the New York-based firms were required to resubmit them
            after weaknesses were found in projections of revenue and
            potential losses, a Fed official said at the time. The
            submissions from all 18 banks in this year's Comprehensive
            Capital Analysis Review, or CCAR, are now approved ahead of
            the next round due the first week of January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators, intent on preventing a repeat of the 2008
            credit crisis, run annual stress tests to see how the largest
            lenders would fare in a recession or economic shock. Banks need
            Fed approval to raise dividends and increase share buybacks.
            Yesterday's announcement is a welcome development for JPMorgan,
            the subject of more than a half dozen U.S. probes, said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst with Guggenheim
            Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Though this is more of a procedural holdover from the
            2013 CCAR, it just reassures JPMorgan investors that while there
            were significant overhang issues, and still are to a degree,
            there is still a base of capital and risk management that
            regulators generally believe is more than adequate,' Mosby
            said. 'That makes this a little more newsworthy than it
            would've been otherwise.' &lt;/p&gt;


            Photographer: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg

            &lt;p&gt;
            JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said yesterday "We are pleased that the Fed determined that our
            CCAR process improvements met their expectations.' Close

        <headline>Spain Sareb Said to Sell Debt to Fortress at 46% Discount</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Spain's bad bank will sell 437
            million euros ($592 million) of loans taken by Realia Business
            SA (RLIA) to Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) for 46 percent less than
            their face value, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to the New York-based private-equity firm, at
            least eight funds expressed interest in buying the debt from the
            Madrid-based bank known as Sareb, one of the people said. Both
            asked not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government set up Sareb last year to absorb 50.8
            billion euros in real estate assets from lenders including the
            Bankia group that took state aid after the Spanish property
            market slumped. Sareb has raised 1.7 billion euros this year,
            beating its target of 1.5 billion euros, Deputy Economy Minister
            Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at a conference in Madrid last
            month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Realia, Spain's second-largest publicly traded real estate
            company by market value, reported a nine-month net loss of 17.3
            million euros and net financial debt of 2.2 billion euros. Last
            month, the Bankia group and Fomento de Construcciones y
            Contratas SA, which together own about 58 percent of Realia,
            hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to seek buyers for their stakes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Realia rose as much as 2.2 percent in Madrid trading and
            was up little changed at 91 cents as of 11:52 a.m. The stock has
            climbed 21 percent this year, giving the company a market value
            of 251 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Sareb declined to comment. A spokesman
            for Fortress, based in New York, also wouldn't comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Procter &amp;amp; Gamble Said Planning Reorganization of Overseas Units</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Procter Gamble Co. (PG) plans to re-organize its overseas business units as Chief Executive Officer
            A.G. Lafley works to cut costs at the world's largest consumer-products maker, said three people briefed on
            the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The maker of Pampers diapers and Crest toothpaste is weighing a merger of
            its Western European unit with Eastern and Central Europe to create one group for the continent, said the
            people, who requested anonymity because the plan won't be unveiled until 2014. PG's Indian business will
            combine with the Middle East and Africa to form another group, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            streamlining, which follows similar moves by other consumer-product companies, is an attempt to accelerate
            sales growth and reduce costs. Some senior management staff in Europe could lose their jobs, according to
            two of the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, Cincinnati-based PG has five geographic units: North
            America, Latin America, Asia, Western Europe, and CEEMEA, which includes Central and Eastern Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa. Western Europe accounted for 18 percent of PG's $84 billion in sales in its most
            recent fiscal year, according to its annual report, while CEEMEA comprised 15 percent of revenue and Asia 18
            percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move represents Lafley's second major shakeup since he returned to run the
            company in May. The following month, PG streamlined its businesses into four industry-based groups 'to
            facilitate faster global expansion of brand and product innovations,' the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock has advanced about 4 percent since Lafley replaced Bob McDonald as CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cost
            Savings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We've openly discussed our focus on productivity and growth, and this includes
            reviewing our geographic operations,' Paul Fox, a spokesman for PG, said in an interview. 'Studies are
            underway to explore the best ways to scale and simplify our global market operations, but no final decisions
            have been made.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At an investor conference in September, Lafley hinted at the coming
            changes when he said 'we'll look to scale operations across all of Europe' as part of its plan 'to
            accelerate and strengthen our productivity and cost savings.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PG is not the first
            consumer-goods company to redraw its map of the world in the wake of the global recession. Last year,
            Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/), the maker of Lysol disinfectants, combined Europe and North America into
            one business unit to shed costs and speed up decision making. The maker of Nurofen painkillers also placed
            Latin America and Asia together into the same reporting unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lafley's Return &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lafley, who had served as president and CEO from 2000 to 2009, returned this year as the company
            struggled to rekindle growth. The 66-year-old Lafley has said he will continue a turnaround plan that
            McDonald embarked on that aims to cut $10 billion in costs through 2016 and renews focus on the company's
            leading businesses, such as hair care. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The maker of Gillette razors and blades entered
            Europe in 1930 by acquiring a soap company in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England. Today, more than 40,000 of PG's
            121,000 employees work in Europe, according to company documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary Lynn
            Ferguson-McHugh is group president for Western Europe, while Laurent Philippe runs the CEEMEA division. Both
            units are headquartered in Geneva. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>SEC's Walter Calls Designated Successor White a Quick Study</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission Chairman Elisse B. Walter said her designated
            successor Mary Jo White will be a quick study as the nation's
            top financial-markets regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter was appointed chairman after Mary Schapiro left the
            post in December. Walter's tenure as chairman may be brief as
            President Barack Obama last week said he will nominate White, a
            former prosecutor and corporate lawyer with no experience as a
            regulator, to succeed her. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She's a very quick study and she's a very smart woman and
            I look forward to working with her as she comes,' Walter told
            reporters today in Washington. 'I think she's terrific.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter, 62, said she would remain chairman until White, a
            former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, is confirmed by the Senate.
            White is a partner at law firm Debevoise Plimpton LLP in New
            York and served on the board of the Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. (NDAQ) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter, who became a commissioner in July 2008, said she
            hasn't decided how long she'll remain on the commission once
            White joins. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have decided not to think about it for now because that
            may be a very short time and that may be a very long time,' she
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter said the commissioners are 'working well together'
            on an effort to overhaul rules governing the $2.7 trillion money
            market mutual-fund industry. The SEC has been working to change
            the rules since the September 2008 collapse of the $62.5 billion
            Reserve Primary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Schapiro Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A plan by Schapiro to force money funds to choose between a
            floating share value or a combination of capital buffers and
            withdrawal restrictions was dropped in August after a majority
            of the five-member commission didn't support moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commissioners renewed consideration of a proposal after the
            Financial Stability Oversight Council issued recommended rules
            in November. The FSOC, a panel of regulatory chiefs lead by the
            Treasury secretary, was created by the Dodd-Frank Act to address
            systemic risks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The whole dynamic around that project has changed,'
            Walter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SEC Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher, a Republican
            appointee, said commissioners are studying options for new
            money-fund regulation prepared by the SEC staff. He declined
            to describe the proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think there is a path forward developing,' Gallagher
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

            David Sowerby, fund manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles Co., said in a telephone interview. His firm
            oversees about $180 billion. 'In a tug-of-war with Europe, the good news, which is earnings, respectable
            valuations, and continued low interest rates, is winning the war.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. equities slumped
            earlier in the day amid concerns Europe's debt crisis may worsen. European Central Bank President Mario
            Draghi will head a meeting of policy makers tomorrow in Frankfurt as euro-area leaders gather for a summit
            in Brussels. The euro has retreated from a 14-month high against the dollar reached on Feb. 1 as Spain's
            premier faced opposition calls to resign. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Record High &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500
            has rallied 6 percent in 2013 as U.S. lawmakers reached a budget compromise and companies reported
            better-than- estimated earnings. The benchmark equity gauge is 3.4 percent below its record high reached in
            October 2007. It has more than doubled since bottoming in March 2009 as the Federal Reserve conducted three
            rounds of bond-buying to lower interest rates and boost economic growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., News
            Corp. and Prudential Financial Inc. are among 24 companies in the SP 500 reporting earnings today. About 74
            percent of the 303 index members that have released results so far in the earnings season exceeded profit
            projections, and 67 percent beat sales estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time
            Warner, owner of the HBO cable network and the Warner Bros. film studio, rose $2.05 to $52.01. Chief
            Executive Officer Jeffrey Bewkes has concentrated the company's growth strategy on its TV business. He
            fostered the development of costly shows, such as HBO's 'Game of Thrones,' and signed rights deals for major
            sports programming, including the NCAA basketball tournament, to command higher fees from pay-TV providers
            such as Comcast Corp. and DirecTV. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Buyback Program &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New
            York-based company also announced a new buyback program and boosted its dividend 11 percent to almost 29
            cents a share, up from 26 cents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company,
            advanced 23 cents to $54.52. The owner of the 'Star Wars' and 'Avengers' franchises said first-quarter
            profit adjusted for some items was 79 cents a share, topping the 77-cent average of 26 analysts' estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 5.2 percent to $11.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ralph Lauren Corp.
            surged 5.9 percent to $174.63. The retailer of its namesake brand clothing reported fiscal third- quarter
            profit that topped analysts' estimates, helped by lower- than-expected expenses and cheaper cotton. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3M Jumps &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;3M Co. jumped 1.2 percent to $102.69, for the biggest advance in the
            Dow. The maker of products ranging from Scotch tape to dental braces authorized a stock buyback program of
            as much as $7.5 billion and increased the quarterly dividend by 7.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aflac Inc.
            fell 4.3 percent to $51.18 after the largest seller of supplemental health insurance forecast profit that
            fell short of analysts's estimates. A weaker yen is pressuring results at Aflac, which gets most of its
            revenue in Japan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GameStop tumbled $1.61 for the second-biggest decline in the SP 500 to
            $25.20. The world's largest video-game retailer surged 16 percent over the previous three days. Microsoft's
            next console will include technology that registers video games over the Internet and renders resold titles
            useless, the gaming website Edge.com said today, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mr. Peabody &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;DreamWorks, the independent studio behind the 'Madagascar' films,
            dropped 68 cents to $16.75. 'Me and My Shadow' was pulled from the schedule and put back in development,
            DreamWorks Animation said. 'Mr. Peabody Sherman,' planned for theaters in November 2013, will now be
            released in March 2014. The change reduces the company's 2013 release slate to two movies from three. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. led declines in the SP 500, falling 9.7 percent to $60.50. The freight
            broker reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wynn Resorts
            Ltd., which depends on its Macau unit for most of its revenue, dropped 2 percent to $123.30. China's
            government will start taking action this month to clamp down on junket operators that bring gamblers from
            the mainland to Macau, the London-based Times reported on its website, citing unidentified people in law
            enforcement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. fell 0.1 percent to $457.35, erasing an earlier rally of as much
            as 1.9 percent. A report showed that Legg Mason Inc. fund manager Bill Miller said the stock may be worth 50
            percent more than its current price. Miller told the Financial Times the shares could be worth more if the
            company were to keep all its cash on its balance sheet and put future free cash flow into a dividend. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Rise Amid Earnings as Jobless Claims Decline</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, sending benchmark indexes to their best gains this year, as claims for
            unemployment benefits fell and earnings from Walt Disney Co. to Akamai (AKAM) Technologies Inc. surpassed
            estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney gained 5.3 percent after posting quarterly profit that beat estimates.
            Akamai, which helps speed Internet-data delivery for customers such as Apple Inc. and Sony Corp., soared 21
            percent after beating forecasts for quarterly earnings. Coca-Cola (KO) Co. advanced 1.1 percent after
            agreeing to buy 10 percent of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. for about $1.25 billion. Green Mountain
            surged 26 percent. Twitter Inc. plunged 24 percent after reporting a wider-than-projected loss and slowing
            user growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) climbed 1.2 percent to 1,773.43 at 4
            p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average to added 188.30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 15,628.53.
            Both measures capped their biggest gains since Dec. 18. About 6.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
            exchanges, 9 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The economy is showing somewhat
            steady improvement and earnings have been good,' Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia
            Trust Co., said in a telephone interview. He helps oversee $1.9 billion. 'The better economic reports are
            helpful, it gives a little bit of a confidence booster.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SodaStream Seen Needing PepsiCo to Counter Coke</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;While SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) has poked fun at Coca-Cola Co. (KO) in its commercials,
            the world's largest soft-drink maker may get the last laugh. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola's agreement to
            buy a 10 percent stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) and help market its new single-serve
            home soda appliance gives the device credibility even before it debuts later this year. That's unwelcome
            news for SodaStream, the leader in at-home soda machines, which already is struggling to maintain the pace
            of its sales growth. It also may pressure SodaStream and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) to partner up and counter the
            threat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion: Green Mountain Sold Some Stock to Buy Back Some Other Stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Many
            will view this announcement as negative for SodaStream, but there is a small possibility that PepsiCo
            follows Coke's lead and partners with SodaStream,' Bill Schmitz, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
            Greenwich, Connecticut, wrote today in a note to clients. 'It will be interesting to see if Green Mountain's
            product, which relies on a chemical reaction, gains traction relative to SodaStream's CO2-based solution.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has a hold rating for SodaStream. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PepsiCo and SodaStream
            spokesmen didn't return telephone calls seeking comment on the speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Russia Stocks Fall First Day in Four as Investors Await Yellen</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russian stocks fell for the first
            time in four days, erasing earlier gains, as investors awaited
            Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen's first report on monetary
            policy and oil declined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex Index (INDEXCF) dropped 0.2 percent to 1,476.28 by the
            close in Moscow after risen as much as 0.5 percent in the
            session. Food retailer OAO Magnit fell 2.1 percent, the most
            since Jan. 21, while OAO Sberbank, the nation's biggest lender,
            sank 1.2 percent to 95.49 rubles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex followed U.S. stocks lower before Yellen speaks
            on policy and the outlook for the economy tomorrow for the first
            time after being sworn in as the central bank's head on Feb. 3.
            Crude oil, Russia's chief export earner, snapped three days of
            gains in London, sinking as much as 0.6 percent to $108.87 a
            barrel after the biggest gain in three months on Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Without a boost to the risk appetite, Russia is hardly
            going to rise, despite the high oil price,' Evgeny Loktyukhov,
            an analyst at OAO Promsvyazbank, said by e-mail. 'The nearest
            risk is tomorrow's speech by the new head of the Federal Reserve
            Yellen, which can shed some light on the Fed's plans regarding
            stimulus tapering and spur a re-evaluation of the risks behind
            emerging markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed pressed ahead with scaling back stimulus in
            January, cutting its monthly bond buying by $10 billion to $65
            billion. The Micex Index advanced an average 77 percent during
            the Fed's first two rounds of debt purchases, and fell 0.6
            percent in periods of no stimulus, the biggest difference of 46
            emerging and developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ruble Depreciation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dollar-denominated RTS Index (RTSI$) fell 0.4 percent to
            1,336.02. Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
            developing-nation economies monitored by Bloomberg. Shares on
            the Micex trade at 3.2 times projected 12-month earnings,
            compared with a multiple of 9.1 for the MSCI Emerging Markets
            Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble has slumped 5.6 percent against the dollar in
            2014, the fourth-worst performer among 24 emerging-market
            currencies tracked by Bloomberg, amid Fed tapering. A weaker
            ruble encourages Russians to withdraw and convert local-currency
            deposits, while hurting retailers by making imports more
            expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banks, Magnit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sberbank snapped three days of gains in Moscow, while its
            depositary receipts retreated 0.9 percent in London to $11.03.
            VTB Group, the nation's second-biggest lender, tumbled 1.1
            percent to 4.55 kopeks and dropped 0.2 percent in the U.K.
            capital to $2.58. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magnit, Russia's biggest grocer, fell to 8,279.90 rubles.
            The company's net retail sales increased 25 percent in January
            to 51.7 billion rubles ($1.5 billion), the company based in
            Krasnodar, southern Russia, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Magnit posted good results but people always have
            inflated expectations for them,' Sergey Vakhrameev, an analyst
            in Moscow at AnkorInvest LLC, said by phone. 'Ruble devaluation
            is negative for banks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble depreciation should help 'provide a constructive
            outlook for Russian energy names in 2014,' according to Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., which raised its coverage view on the nation's
            oil industry to attractive from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft (ROSN), which was lifted to buy at Goldman analysts
            including Geydar Mamedov in a report today, advanced 0.6 percent
            to 247.41 rubles in Moscow, while OAO Lukoil, Russia's biggest
            non-state crude producer, added 0.6 percent to 1,987.50 rubles.
            OAO Bashneft jumped 4 percent to 2,163 rubles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rosneft, the nation's largest crude producer, should
            benefit from improving capital spending control this year and
            strengthening cash-flow generation, as well as the ruble's
            decline against the dollar, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Unlike banks, oil companies benefit from the ruble
            devaluation,' AnkorInvest's Vakhrameev said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Kindler, Taubman Outfox Malone to Help Comcast Trump Charter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bankers behind
            Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s $45.2 billion bid for Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC), a
            surprise end-run around veteran media dealmaker John Malone,
            drew from experience on some of the past decades' biggest deals,
            including the RJR-Nabisco buyout made famous in 'Barbarians at
            the Gate.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bankers James B. 'Jimmy' Lee, Blair Effron, Paul Taubman
            and Robert Kindler also have figured variously in Michael Dell's
            move to take his firm private and the sale of NBC by General
            Electric Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In sealing the Time Warner Cable deal last night, the four
            bankers helped Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts
            trump a bid from Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR), advised by Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and LionTree Advisors LLC. Charter's
            billionaire backer Malone had courted Time Warner Cable for
            months before the Comcast bid -- the biggest cable deal since
            Comcast bought ATT Inc.'s cable assets for $52 billion in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Vice Chairman Lee and Taubman, a
            Morgan Stanley alumnus, will take a share of as much as $68
            million for working with Comcast, according to New York-based
            research firm Freeman Co. Part of that fee will go to co-adviser Barclays Plc (BARC), according to Freeman.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, and Morgan
            Stanley's Kindler may get as much as $75 million for advising
            Time Warner Cable, Freeman said. Sharing in the fee will be
            Citigroup Inc. and Allen Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Professional Links &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four bankers have been professionally linked for years.
            JPMorgan's Lee and Centerview's Effron both had roles in GE's
            $16.7 billion sale of its remaining stake in NBC Universal to
            Comcast in early 2013. Kindler worked with Lee at JPMorgan as
            head of global MA before Taubman recruited him to come work at
            Morgan Stanley (MS) in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, Taubman and Kindler have worked with and across the
            table from each other on numerous deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee advised UAL Corp.'s United Airlines while Kindler
            worked with Continental Airlines on their $3.1 billion merger in
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taubman and Effron, meanwhile, are both among the biggest
            Wall Street fundraisers for President Barack Obama and other
            Democratic Party candidates. This is the first deal they have
            worked on together, said a person familiar with the matter, who
            asked not to be identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Secret Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All four veteran bankers worked to keep the matter secret
            from Malone, himself one of the biggest dealmakers in the cable
            industry's formative years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Malone won big with bets on startups like
            Discovery Communications Inc. and Black Entertainment Television
            and even by bailing out rival media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. Since
            largely abandoning the U.S. cable market in 1999, Malone has
            spent about $50 billion in Europe. His Liberty Global Inc. is on
            track to report 2013 sales of almost $15 billion, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is just the latest high-profile deal involving
            JPMorgan's Lee. He led the bank's effort in taking General
            Motors Co. public in 2010 with a record IPO. He also worked with
            Effron on News Corp.'s 2007 acquisition of Dow Jones Co.,
            owner of the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Effron, co-founder of the independent investment bank
            Centerview with Robert Pruzan in 2006, is portrayed as a junior
            banker arranging a secret meeting between KKR Co. and a senior
            Nabisco executive in the book 'Barbarians,' by Bryan Burrough
            and John Helyar, which described the $30 billion purchase of RJR
            Nabisco in 1988, detailing the egos and back-room dealings that
            went on at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ConAgra, InBev &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Effron worked on ConAgra Foods Inc.'s purchase of Ralcorp
            Holdings for $5 billion, and advised H.J. Heinz Co. last year
            when the food giant was sold to Brazil private-equity firm 3G
            and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Effron also advised
            InBev when it acquired Anheuser-Busch in 2008 for $52 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Time Warner Cable deal is another coup for Taubman, who
            began PJT Capital LLC last year after leaving Morgan Stanley in
            2013, following a 27-year career there. He had a role as an
            individual adviser in Verizon Communication Inc.'s $130 billion
            buyout of partner Vodafone Group Plc's 45 percent stake in
            Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S. mobile carrier. The
            acquisition, the largest announced in the past five years,
            pushed PJT into the top 20 deal advisers of 2013, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Kindler's Client &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kindler, Morgan Stanley's vice chairman of investment
            banking, has had Time Warner Cable as a client since he was a
            lawyer at Cravath, Swaine Moore, said a person familiar with
            the matter, keeping them as a client in his next two roles. He
            has worked before with Comcast, advising the cable company on
            its acquisition of ATT Broadband, and was with Grupo Modelo SAB
            when the Mexican brewer was sold to Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fee pool for the financial advisers is projected to be
            as much as $143 million for both sides, which would be the
            third-largest payday since 2009, according to Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is the top adviser on mergers and
            acquisitions this year including the Comcast-Time Warner Cable
            transaction, with 21 deals valued at $115 billion, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. The New York-based investment bank also
            worked with Suntory Holdings Ltd., the closely held Japanese
            whiskey and beer maker, on its $16 billion takeover of Beam Inc.
            in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is ranked second, with 25 deals worth $113
            billion, and Centerview is third with seven transactions valued
            at $88 billion, the data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs led MA advising last year, working on 349
            deals valued at $559 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Goldman, 16 Other Firms to End Analyst Previews</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) were among 18 financial firms that
            agreed to stop participating in some surveys of analyst sentiment while New York investigates early access
            to the information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firms will stop answering analyst surveys by 'certain elite,
            technologically sophisticated clients' seeking to use the information for trading, according to New York
            Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The interim pacts are part of efforts to combat advantages secured by
            investors that get to see potentially market-moving data before other traders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schneiderman
            requested that the firms stop participating in these surveys while he conducts an industry wide
            investigation into early access to analyst sentiment. The deals follow an accord last month with BlackRock
            Inc. (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, to end a program in which it systematically surveyed analysts
            on companies they cover. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion: What Does Eric Schneiderman Know That the Rest of Us
            Don't?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Our markets will only be fair and healthy if everyone plays by the same rules,
            which is why we will continue to take action against those who provide unfair advantages to elite traders at
            the expense of the rest of us,' Schneiderman said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;European naphtha declined as Vitol
            Group sold two cargoes, bringing its total in the past two
            sessions to six lots. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diesel barges gained as Trafigura Beheer BV and Gunvor
            Group Ltd. bought. Gasoil rose for the first time in three days
            on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Light Products &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Naphtha traded at $929 and $933 a metric ton, according to
            a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
            pricing window which showed Trafigura and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
            as buyers. Deals were done Jan. 4 at $932 to $934 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vitol bought 17 naphtha lots in the last week of December,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Naphtha's crack, or discount to Brent crude, was unchanged
            at $6.20 a barrel as of 2:14 p.m. local time, according to data
            from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gasoline barges traded from $970 to $981.50 a ton in the
            Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area, according to a similar survey
            of the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts. That compares with
            deals from $967 to $978 on Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chevron, Vitol, Gunvor and Total SA sold barges of the
            Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.
            Trafigura, Shell and Gunvor bought barges that typically
            comprise 1,000 to 2,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gasoline's crack, or premium to Brent crude, rose to $6.76
            a barrel, compared with $6.66 on Jan. 4, according to PVM data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Middle Distillates &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diesel barges rose to trade at $20 to $21 a ton more than
            January gasoil versus plus $20 in the previous session, the
            survey of Platts showed. BP and Argos Groep BV sold, and Vitol
            bought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heating oil barges traded from a $1 discount to January
            gasoil to parity to the marker as Mercuria Energy Trading SA,
            Shell and Mocoh SA bought from Vitol and Gunvor. That compares
            with a discount of $1 on Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gasoil for January delivery rose $8.25, or 0.9 percent, to
            $936.75 as of 5:30 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contract's discount to February futures was $1.75 a
            ton, keeping the market in contango, a structure that can signal
            falling demand or rising supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gasoil for January delivery last closed at a premium to the
            next-month contract on Dec. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gasoil's crack gained to $15.03 a barrel versus $13.64 in
            the previous session. Brent fell 0.3 percent to $111.02 a barrel
            on ICE. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Money managers' net-long bets on gasoil increased to 52,985
            positions in the week to Dec. 31 from 50,223 in the previous
            period, the data showed. It is the highest since the week ended

            &lt;h2&gt;Residues &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-sulfur fuel oil changed hands from $602.50 to $603.50
            a ton, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with $601 to
            $602.50 on Jan. 4. The low-sulfur grade traded at $624 to $625. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Equity Residential to Sell Up to $1.5 Billion of Units</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Equity Residential (EQR), the largest
            publicly traded U.S. apartment landlord, agreed to sell 27
            properties to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Greystar Real Estate
            Partners LLC for as much as $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction values the apartments at about $187,000 per
            unit, Chicago-based Equity Residential said in a statement
            today. The joint venture is obligated to purchase at least $1.38
            billion of assets. The 8,010 units are located in northern New
            Jersey, Florida, Phoenix, Denver, Southern California and the
            Washington, D.C., and San Francisco Bay areas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equity Residential, founded by billionaire Sam Zell, said
            in November that it would sell some assets after agreeing to buy
            part of rival landlord Archstone Inc. from Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc., a deal that will boost holdings in cities where
            it already has properties. The real estate investment trust is
            accelerating its disposal of properties outside its core growth
            areas, with plans for as much as $4 billion in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's deal is 'evidence that they had their ducks in
            order from the very beginning in terms of how they were going to
            finance the Archstone transaction,' Richard Anderson, a REIT
            analyst with BMO Capital Markets in New York, said in a
            telephone interview. 'They're no dummies. They're not going to
            sign up for a several-billion-dollar transaction and not have a
            pretty good plan in place before they announce it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Significant Progress' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equity Residential agreed to purchase 60 percent of
            Archstone in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $6.5 billion.
            AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB), the second-biggest publicly traded
            apartment landlord, is buying the other 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale to Goldman and Greystar is expected to be
            completed by the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With this transaction we will have made significant
            progress selling assets in our exit markets and non-core assets
            in primary markets to fund our share of the acquisition of
            Archstone,' David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential's president
            and chief executive officer, said in the statement. 'Demand for
            multifamily assets remains very strong.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $187,000 price per unit is more than the $149,000
            average last year for the seven regions in which Equity
            Residential sold assets, according to Ben Carlos Thypin,
            director of market analysis at Real Capital Analytics Inc. in
            New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is reasonable to assume these are assets of relatively
            high quality,' Thypin said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The properties include the Ellipse at Government Center, a
            newly renovated community in Fairfax, Virginia, with a pool and
            tennis court where a two-bedroom apartment can be leased for
            $1,450 a month, according to Equity Residential's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Also included in the deal is Iron Horse Park, north of San
            Francisco in Pleasant Hill, where apartments have views of Mount
            Diablo and a two-bedroom unit rents for $1,825. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to JPMorgan Say Sell Emerging Markets After Slide</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street's biggest banks say the slump in emerging-market assets that left equities trailing
            advanced-nation shares by the most since 1998 last year will prove more than a fleeting selloff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends investors cut allocations in developing nations by a third,
            forecasting 'significant underperformance' for stocks, bonds and currencies over the next 10 years. JPMorgan
            Chase Co. expects local-currency bonds to post 10 percent of their average returns since 2004 in the coming
            year, while Morgan Stanley projects the Brazilian real, Turkish lira and Russian ruble will extend declines
            after tumbling as much as 17 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the economies of Brazil, Russia,
            India and China symbolized the increasing power of the developing world during the worst of the global
            financial crisis and delivered outsized returns, Morgan Stanley says some of the same nations may now prove
            to be laggards as the U.S. Federal Reserve scales back unprecedented stimulus and interest rates rise. The
            MSCI Emerging Markets Index is down 3.1 percent this year, compared with a 0.8 percent drop in the
            developed-market index, and hit a four-month low yesterday as data from China showed weakness in
            manufacturing and services. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dimon Exits New York Fed Board After Expiration of Term</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon has left the board of the Federal Reserve
            Bank of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon is no longer on the board after the Dec. 31
            expiration of his second term as a director, Jack Gutt, a
            spokesman for the New York Fed, said today in a telephone
            interview. Dimon was a Class A director, elected by the banks in
            the New York Fed's district. A replacement has not yet been
            named. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers last year criticized Dimon for serving on the Fed
            district bank's board after JPMorgan reported a trading loss
            that rekindled concern the New York Fed, the company's principal
            regulator, is too cozy with Wall Street. Senator Bernie Sanders,
            a Vermont independent, along with Democrats Barbara Boxer of
            California and Mark Begich of Alaska, introduced legislation
            last year that would remove the industry's executives from the
            12 regional Fed banks' boards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Congress created the Fed in 1913 with public and private
            features. Three bankers are on each of the 12 Fed district bank
            boards, along with six other directors who represent the
            borrowing public. They play no part in bank supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon said in June that the district banks benefit from
            industry leaders' input. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If I had a board, I'd want to hear from a lot of
            different types of people,' Dimon said June 19 at a hearing of
            the House Financial Services Committee in Washington. 'It'd be
            funny to be talking about global markets and not have someone
            involved in the global markets at the table. It certainly does
            not have to be me.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank, said Dimon
            finished out his term, declining further comment. Dimon's
            departure from the board was earlier reported by the New York
            Times. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Robert Walters Declines on Challenging Outlook: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Robert Walters Plc (RWA) fell the most in
            almost six months after the recruitment company said there were
            no signs that 'challenging' market conditions will improve in
            2013. Hays Plc (HAS) and Michael Page International Plc (MPI) also declined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robert Walters fell as much as 5.9 percent, the biggest
            intraday drop since July 13, and was down 5 pence or 2.5 percent
            at 198 pence at 11:43 a.m. At least four analysts trimmed their
            2013 profit estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Under current trading conditions we still believe most
            recruiters remain significantly over-valued,' Paul Jones, an
            analyst at Panmure Gordon Co. who recommends selling the
            stock, said in a note to clients. 'Robert Walters is no
            exception.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The recession in Europe, the slowdown in emerging markets
            and fewer banking sector hires are holding back job recruitment
            and providing few signs of when markets will recover. Companies
            such as Hays now earn most of their fees outside the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With market conditions remaining challenging, and the
            nature of the downturn meaning that visibility is even lower
            than usual, we are rebasing our forecasts to take a more
            cautious stance on the pace of recovery,' Sebastien Jantet, an
            analyst at Investec Plc (INVP) with a buy recommendation on the stock,
            said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Continued Uncertainty &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net fee income rose 2 percent to 47.4
            million pounds ($76.3 million) from a year earlier, and was 4
            percent higher on a constant currency basis, London-based Robert
            Walters said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company expects to meet its 2012 forecasts and had
            already taken action to manage its cost base given the continued
            uncertainty, Chief Executive Officer Robert Walters said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hays, the U.K.'s largest recruitment firm, is due to
            provide a fourth-quarter trading update on Jan. 10. It fell as
            much as 4.2 percent and was down 2.5 percent at 83.75 pence.
            James Gilbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, yesterday raised
            Hays to buy from hold on evidence of stabilizing global demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Page, which is due to make a trading statement a
            week today, fell as much as 6.6 percent, the most since June,
            and was down 3.7 percent at 399.4 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investec's Jantet cut his estimate for 2013 pretax profit
            at Robert Walters by 28 percent and by 40 percent for 2014.
            Analysts at Canaccord, Panmure and Shore Capital also lowered
            2013 pretax profit estimates. Oriel Securities said it would
            'look carefully' at this year's estimates, which may prove
            demanding given the current trading and outlook. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Goldman in Giving Daily Money Fund Values</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Four of the top 10 U.S. money-market
            fund providers said they'll disclose daily fund values,
            pressuring rivals to follow suit as regulators consider banning
            the use of a constant $1 share price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's biggest money manager, will
            begin revealing daily net asset values for all its U.S. money
            funds on Jan. 16. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) began today to
            disclose the values for its funds that are eligible to purchase
            commercial paper, or prime funds. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) plans to
            take that step for all money funds, starting with prime funds on
            Jan. 14, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. will make daily
            market values available 'going forward.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The prime goal here is to diffuse the misperception
            that's been created by regulators that fund share prices are an
            accounting fiction,' Peter Crane, president of research firm
            Crane Data LLC, said in an interview. 'It's a pretty good bet
            the daily values will show that market-value NAVs don't float.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators led by former U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro have worked to impose tighter
            restrictions on money funds since the September 2008 collapse of
            the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund. Proposals to make the
            funds stronger have included abandoning the $1 fixed share
            price, an idea providers want to counter because they say it
            would destroy the appeal of money funds, which investors use as
            an alternative to holding cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money-market funds buy short-term debt securities and book
            them based on their expected value at maturity. They also round
            their share prices to the nearest 1 cent. Those practices
            obscure small fluctuations in the funds' market values. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;SEC 'Encouraged' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rule changes enacted by the SEC in 2010 required funds to
            disclose their market value, or 'shadow net-asset value,' on a
            monthly basis, with a 60-day lag. Some providers, including
            Fidelity and Vanguard, opposed the change at the time, saying it
            could confuse investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Elisse B. Walter, who took over from Shapiro
            last month, welcomed today's announcements by the New York-based
            fund managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chairman Walter is encouraged when industry voluntarily
            takes steps to provide greater transparency for investors,'
            John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, the biggest U.S. money-fund manager
            with $420 billion in such assets, is 'considering' daily
            disclosure of per-share market values, Stephen Austin, a
            spokesman for the Boston-based company, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vanguard, Fidelity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nancy Prior, Fidelity's head of money funds, said in an
            October speech in Washington the firm would support more
            frequent disclosure of market values. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If regulators believe that providing this information
            more often could improve the resiliency of the funds and the
            overall stability of the financial system, then we would support
            such disclosure,' Prior said in the speech. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vanguard Group Inc., the fourth-biggest provider, said it
            wasn't planning to increase the frequency of shadow NAV
            disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have not seen an increased demand for more frequent
            disclosure from our clients, who are primarily retail
            investors,' John Woerth, a spokesman for the Valley Forge,
            Pennsylvania-based company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Woerth said market-value fluctuations in Vanguard's largest
            money fund, the $123 billion Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund,
            has been 'de minimus.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's asset-management unit was the first to
            announce a change in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crane said he doubted the practical value of disclosing the
            market values. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rounding Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The shadow NAVs don't differ materially from the rounded
            NAVs unless something blows up, in which case you don't see it
            until after it happens,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meghan McAndrew, a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh-based
            Federated Investors, the second-largest money-market mutual-fund
            manager in the U.S., declined to comment on the firm's plans
            regarding NAV disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the rule's enforcement, some companies,
            including Charles Schwab Corp. and T. Rowe Price Group (TROW) Inc.,
            injected cash into funds that were carrying small losses to
            boost their market values back to $1 before they were forced to
            disclose the shortfalls. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Schapiro's Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More recently, industry leaders offered to increase fund
            disclosure as part of a proposal made to regulators in October.
            That plan would require funds to reveal shadow NAVs on a weekly
            basis with a five-day lag. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies made the proposal while continuing to resist
            calls from Schapiro, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department
            for SEC commissioners to consider approving a floating share
            price for funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schapiro, who left the SEC in December, had planned as
            recently as August to propose that money funds be forced to
            choose to either float their share value or adopt a combination
            of capital buffers and withdrawal restrictions to protect
            against credit losses and investor runs. She shelved the
            proposal when three of her four fellow commissioners signaled
            that they would reject it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A senior panel of regulators, the Financial Stability
            Oversight Council, began a process in November by which it can
            pressure SEC commissioners to reconsider the elements of
            Schapiro's plan. The panel includes the heads of the SEC and
            central bank, and is headed by Treasury Secretary Timothy
            Geithner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reserve Primary &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not doing this in anticipation of a floating net-asset value,' JPMorgan's Deutsch said. 'Our
            decision was
            informed by the extra scrutiny' money funds have come under
            since 2008. 'The world changed when the Reserve Fund broke the
            buck and since then we've been making details of our holdings
            more accessible.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Reserve Primary fund fell below $1 a share, or 'broke
            the buck,' in September 2008 because it held debt issued by
            bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Its closing triggered a
            wider run on prime money funds that helped freeze global credit
            markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it would expand the daily disclosure
            next week to include money funds that invest in municipal and
            government debt. The daily values will be available to investors
            on the morning after the previous day's close. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan manages about $233 billion in U.S. money funds,
            according to Crane Data, based in Westborough, Massachusetts.
            Goldman Sachs's asset-management unit manages $856 billion in
            client money. It is the eighth-biggest provider of money-market
            funds in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Most U.S. Stocks Fall as World Bank Offsets Apple Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects Boeing aircraft model under 'Boeing Slumps' subhead.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most U.S.
            stocks fell, following yesterday's gain, as a cut in the World Bank's growth forecasts offset a rally in
            Apple Inc. as investors watched earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boeing Co. (BA) slumped 3.4 percent as All
            Nippon Airways Co. and Japan Airlines Co., the world's largest users of the 787 jets, grounded their entire
            fleet of Dreamliners. Custody banks Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) dropped at
            least 2.7 percent. Apple, which slid below $500 a share yesterday for the first time in 11 months, rallied
            4.2 percent to halt a three-day decline. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added 4.1 percent after the bank's profit
            almost tripled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three stocks retreated for every two rising on U.S. exchanges at 4 p.m.
            New York time. The Standard Poor's 500 Index advanced less than 0.1 percent to 1,472.63. The Dow Jones
            Industrial Average declined 23.66 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,511.23. About 5.6 billion shares changed
            hands on U.S. exchanges, or 8.6 percent below the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The cuts in
            growth forecasts are reminders that there's still work to be done,' said Brad Sorensen, director of market
            and sector analysis at San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp. His firm has $1.92 trillion in client
            assets. 'In the U.S., it's early to talk about the earnings season, but so far we're relatively pleased with
            what we've seen. We've had a good start to the year in stocks. There's very little doubt that there's quite
            a bit of money on the sidelines that could provide a nice boost higher.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growth
            Forecast &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Bank cut its global growth forecast for this year as austerity
            measures, high unemployment and low business confidence weigh on economies in developed nations. German
            Chancellor Angela Merkel's government cut its growth forecast for Europe's biggest economy. Luxembourg Prime
            Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said the strength of the euro poses a threat to the region's economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy picked up across much of the country last month, boosted by auto and home sales,
            even as the outlook for unemployment showed few signs of improvement, the Federal Reserve said. Industrial
            production in the U.S. climbed for a second month in December as demand picked up for business equipment,
            showing factories expanded even as lawmakers battled over the federal budget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Earnings
            Season &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, nine other companies in the SP 500 were
            scheduled to report results today. Almost 75 percent of the 39 SP 500 companies which reported quarterly
            results beat analysts forecasts. Fourth-quarter profits grew 2.5 percent, according to analysts' estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the second-slowest quarterly growth since 2009, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has risen 3.3 percent so far this year, extending 2012's 13 percent surge. Yet the
            benchmark gauge is trading at 14.8 times reported earnings, compared with an average of 16.5 since 1954,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'On the positive side of the ledger we've got
            at least what I consider to be undemanding valuations for stocks in general,' said Norm Conley, chief
            executive officer at St. Louis-based J.A. Glynn Co, which manages about $975 million. 'We've got earnings
            season kicking off here and so far no huge bad surprise, so that is an incremental positive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using options as
            insurance against declines in the SP 500, lost 1 percent to 13.42. Earlier today, the gauge fell to the
            lowest level since 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Boeing Slumps &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boeing slumped 3.4 percent
            to $74.34. The 787 faces fresh scrutiny after the Japanese airlines grounded almost half the world's
            Dreamliner fleet for at least two days following an emergency landing. All Nippon Airways pilots on a
            domestic flight got battery-fault warnings and saw smoke in the cockpit, the U.S. National Transportation
            Board said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The groundings added to the questions plaguing a model that was
            targeted for a U.S. assessment because of a Jan. 7 fire in a lithium-ion battery pack on a Japan Airlines
            plane in Boston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon slumped 2.8 percent to $26.04 and Northern Trust dropped 5.7
            percent to $49.78. Both banks have responded to near-zero interest rates by reducing staff and expenses to
            protect profit margins. While the banks benefited from rising stock prices, which increase fees for
            overseeing and managing investor money, low interest rates and slow capital-markets activity have hurt their
            ability to expand earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chipotle, Dell &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chipotle Mexican Grill
            Inc. (CMG) fell 5.5 percent to $280.94 after reporting preliminary fourth-quarter profit that trailed
            analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell Inc. (DELL) dropped 4.3 percent to $12.61, after rallying 21
            percent over the last two days. The third-largest PC maker is discussing a leveraged buyout with
            private-equity firms TPG Capital and Silver Lake, a person with knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology, which comprises the biggest group in the SP 500, rose the most among 10 industries.
            Apple (AAPL) rose 4.2 percent to $506.09, after slumping 7.2 percent over the previous three days. The
            company introduced installment payment plans for buyers of iPhones and MacBook laptops in China as it
            struggles to compete with low-cost devices in the world's largest computer and mobile-phone market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank Profits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 4.1 percent to $141.09. Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-2011 and
            said he expected earnings growth to resume when the economy and markets improved. A stock-market rebound and
            a $500 million profit from selling a hedge fund-administration unit helped revenue recover from the lowest
            first half since 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) gained 1 percent to $46.82. The largest
            U.S. bank by assets said fourth-quarter profit rose 53 percent, beating analysts' estimates as mortgage
            revenue more than doubled and the lender set aside less for future losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genworth
            Financial Inc. (GNW) rallied 8.9 percent to $8.85. The insurer that named a new chief executive officer this
            month said it is reorganizing to separate most of the company from the mortgage-guaranty operation that
            saddled the firm with losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith Wesson Holding Corp. rose 5.7 percent to $8.91.
            Sturm Ruger Co. added 5 percent to $50.38. President Barack Obama proposed the most ambitious set of gun
            control proposals in decades, calling for a renewal of a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition
            magazines and setting out 23 executive actions he'll take such as ordering agencies to share data for
            background checks and addressing mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Transportation Stocks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These proposals were widely expected to occur today,' said Rommel Dionisio, analyst at Wedbush
            Securities based in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Constellation Brands Inc. added 6.2 percent to $38.65
            after being rated buy in new coverage at Buckingham Research by equity analyst Alice Longley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dow is better positioned to set a record now that its transportation-stock counterpart has done
            so, according to Richard Moroney, editor of the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter. The Dow Jones
            Transportation Average has led the Dow industrials throughout the rally which started in March 2009.
            Yesterday the Dow transports closed at 5,639.64, an all-time high. The average had climbed 6.3 percent for
            the year, its best performance through Jan. 15 since 1987. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a legitimate move,'
            Moroney, who serves as the chief investment officer at Horizon Investment Services LLC as well as the
            newsletter's editor, said yesterday in a telephone interview. 'I take it as a positive.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All
            20 companies in the Dow transports had gains for the year as of yesterday. Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL), the
            world's second- largest airline, set the pace by rising 15 percent. Most beat the Dow industrials' 3.3
            percent advance for 2013 as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter earnings reports will largely determine
            whether the industrials reach a record any time soon, according to Moroney. The average would have to
            advance 4.7 percent to surpass its peak of 14,164.53 in October 2007. It's 0.6 percent away from beating
            last year's high. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Alibaba Denies Hiring Investment Banks for Share Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects story first published Jan. 16 to say Alibaba hasn't hired banks for an IPO.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd., China's biggest e-commerce company, denied hiring Credit Suisse Group
            AG (CSGN) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to arrange an initial public offering in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We
            have not hired any banks in connection with any IPOs,' John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for
            Alibaba, said yesterday by telephone. Officials at Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment banks are vying for a role on a possible Alibaba IPO, said three people with knowledge
            of the matter who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. An offering could happen
            this year, and potentially raise $3 billion to $4 billion, according to an estimate from one of the people.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A deal of that size could potentially be the largest Internet IPO since Facebook Inc.,
            and would follow Alibaba's re-purchase of a stake from Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year in a deal that valued
            the Hangzhou-based company at $35 billion. Alibaba this week announced billionaire founder Jack Ma's
            decision to step down as chief executive officer following an organizational restructuring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Orioles Manager Showalter Gets MLB Contract Extension Until 2018</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter, who directed the franchise to its most wins in 15
            years and a playoff spot last year, was given a contract
            extension through 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dan Duquette, the Orioles' executive vice president of
            baseball operations, received a similar extension, the Major
            League Baseball team said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Showalter, 56, has accumulated a 196-185 record since
            joining the Orioles during the 2010 season. Baltimore's
            appearance in the 2012 playoffs was its first since 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On May 1, Showalter became the 58th manager in major league
            history to win 1,000 games. He enters the 2013 season ranked
            49th on the career list with 1,078 wins and is sixth among
            active managers. He also has managed the Texas Rangers, Arizona
            Diamondbacks and the New York Yankees in 1992-95. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duquette, 54, has spent 11 seasons as general manager with
            the Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox and Orioles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Chairman Walter Says Cross-Border Swaps Rules Top Agenda</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Completing Dodd-Frank rules,
            including those governing cross-border swaps, tops the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission's agenda this year, SEC
            Chairman Elisse Walter said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2010 Dodd-Frank overhaul of financial regulation
            required the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
            draft rules to increase transparency in the swaps market. The
            SEC's rules would address the overseas reach of regulations
            governing security-based swaps. The agencies missed a July 2011
            deadline to complete most of their Dodd-Frank regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter said finishing Dodd-Frank rules would lead her
            agenda as the commission, divided between two Democrats and two
            Republicans, tries to move forward under her leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That is what is first on the agenda and really stands as
            the most important thing we have to do as a prelude to adopting
            anything else,' Walter told the SEC's Investor Advisory
            Committee today in Washington. 'We will put that out for robust
            public comment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter described the swap rules as 'the critical
            linchpin' of Dodd-Frank because of the 'global nature of the
            market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until Dodd-Frank was enacted in 2010, swaps were largely
            unregulated, often uncleared and traded directly between banks
            and other consumers of derivatives. Dodd-Frank requires traders
            including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to
            have most swaps cleared and traded on exchanges or swap-
            execution facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Timetable &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter declined to say when the commission would propose
            the rules. She also said she would prioritize rules required by
            the so-called JOBS Act, which sought to ease access to capital
            for startup firms and small businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC in August proposed a rule mandated by the 2012
            measure to lift a ban on mass marketing by hedge funds and other
            private offerings. Some consumer groups want Walter to add
            investor protections to a final rule, including a means to
            verify that that investors are sophisticated enough to
            participate in private offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC's two Republican commissioners have said the ban
            should be lifted without imposing new restraints. Democratic
            Commissioner Luis A. Aguilar voted against the August proposal
            over concerns that it opened up vulnerabilities for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chairman Walter is on the hot seat,' said Barbara Roper,
            director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of
            America. 'She's going to make someone really angry no matter
            what she does.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter said the commission would lift the ban and was still
            considering the details of a final rule. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once a statute is passed, we will carry it out,' she
            said. 'It is not our job to undo congressional
            determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Debevoise, Goodwin Procter, Norton Rose: Business of Law</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mary Jo White, the former U.S.
            attorney in Manhattan, is under consideration to become the next
            chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, three people
            with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;White, now a partner at Debevoise Plimpton LLP in New
            York, would succeed Elisse Walter, who took over as SEC chairman
            last month, said the people, who asked not to be named because
            the matter isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The choice of White, who was known as a no-nonsense
            prosecutor, would be a departure for the agency, which has
            tended to be run by lawyers steeped in financial policy making
            and the securities industry. Her relative inexperience in those
            areas, along with her work defending corporate clients including
            Ken Lewis, the former chief executive officer of Bank of America
            Corp. (BAC), is likely to draw fire from some lawmakers and advocates
            for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York from
            1993 to 2002, White became a leading terrorism prosecutor,
            winning the conviction of four followers of Osama bin Laden for
            the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Under her
            direction, prosecutors won convictions for the 1993 World Trade
            Center bombing and a failed plot to blow up the United Nations
            headquarters and other New York landmarks. During that time, she
            supervised Robert Khuzami, the SEC's outgoing enforcement
            director, and George Canellos, his deputy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment on her
            possible nomination. White didn't respond to an e-mail seeking
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;White's husband, John W. White, was head of the SEC's
            division of corporation finance, which is responsible for
            disclosure policies, under Republican SEC chairman Christopher Cox from 2006 to 2008. He's now a partner at
            law firm Cravath
            Swaine Moore LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lawyer Sues San Antonio Spurs After Starters Skipped Miami Game &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A fan of the Miami Heat basketball team is suing the San
            Antonio Spurs because four of their starters didn't play in the
            team's Nov. 29 game in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his complaint filed in state court in Miami, Lawrence
            McGuinness, a partner at McGuinness Gonzales PA in Miami,
            accused Spurs coach Gregg Popovich of inflicting economic
            damages on fans who attended the game. The San Antonio Express-
            News first reported the suit Jan. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, asks the
            Spurs to refund the difference between premium tickets charged
            for more popular games and lower-priced tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Spurs were fined $250,000 by the National Basketball
            Association a day after the players missed the game. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The NBA said in an e-mailed release Dec. 1 that the move
            violated league policy 'against resting players in a manner
            contrary to the best interests of the NBA.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the players pulled from the lineup and sent back to
            San Antonio were 36-year-old Tim Duncan, 30-year-old Tony Parker
            and 35-year-old Manu Ginobili. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tom James, the senior director of communications for the
            Spurs, declined to comment on the litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McGuinness said in a telephone interview that 'people
            think of lawyers as ambulance chasers, but anything I get from
            the suit will go to the Hurricane Sandy relief fund in New York.
            In fact, this case is costing me money rather than making me
            money.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Harry Winston Says Ekati Investor Files Suit to Block BHP Sale &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harry Winston Diamond Corp. (HW) said a holder of 10 percent of
            the Ekati diamond mine sued to block the company's proposed
            acquisition of BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)'s 80 percent stake in the
            Canadian operation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;C. Fipke Holdings Ltd. alleged in an action in Ontario
            Superior Court of Justice that offers made by BHP to Fipke
            didn't comply with Fipke's rights under joint-venture agreements
            for Ekati, Toronto-based Harry Winston said in a statement. The
            suit also names Harry Winston, Stewart Blusson, who is another
            minority owner, and Blusson-controlled Archon Minerals Ltd. (ACS),
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harry Winston said Nov. 13 it had agreed to pay about $500
            million for Melbourne-based BHP's interests in the diamond mine
            as well as gem marketing operations. Minority shareholders held
            pre-emptive rights to purchase BHP's stake in the mine within 60
            days in the event of a sale, BHP said in a separate statement on
            Nov. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chuck Fipke and Blusson discovered the Ekati deposit in the
            Northwest Territories in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harry Winston and BHP believe that the claim by C. Fipke,
            known as Fipco, 'is entirely without merit, and intend to
            vigorously defend the action in order to proceed with the
            purchase and sale of the Ekati Mine,' Harry Winston said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fipke didn't immediately return a call for comment outside
            of regular business hours. The filing couldn't be immediately
            confirmed in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe that we have complied with our obligations
            under the Right of First Refusal provision and will work to
            resolve the dispute as soon as practical to ensure the sale
            process can be completed,' Ruban Yogarajah, a BHP spokesman,
            said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blusson didn't immediately return a call for comment to his
            Vancouver office outside of normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Delaware Court Dismisses Waste Claim Over Bonus Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A complaint challenging a corporate board's decision to pay
            more than $130 million in executive bonuses without adopting a
            plan that could make the bonuses tax deductible doesn't state a
            claim for waste, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The decision to sacrifice some tax savings in order to
            retain flexibility in compensation decisions is a classic
            exercise of business judgment,' Justice Carolyn Berger wrote
            for the en banc court. 'Even if the decision were a poor one'
            as alleged by the plaintiff, 'it was not unconscionable or
            irrational,' the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court said Susan Freedman was a stockholder of XTO
            Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation that, before its acquisition
            by ExxonMobil Corp., was in the oil and gas production business.
            In 2008, Freedman filed a derivative action alleging that XTO's
            board committed waste by failing to adopt a plan that could have
            made its bonuses tax deductible. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court said that from 2004 to 2007, XTO allegedly paid
            executive bonuses totaling more than $130 million, and those
            payments weren't tax deductible. The XTO board was aware that
            under a qualified Section 162(m) plan, bonuses could be tax
            deductible, 'but it did not think that its compensation
            decisions should be 'constrained' by such a plan,' the court
            recounted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shortly after Freedman filed her complaint, the court said,
            XTO's board approved a Section 162(m) plan. The plan was cleared
            by stockholders at XTO's 2009 annual meeting. The court said XTO
            never made use of the plan, because it merged with and into an
            Exxon subsidiary in June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Freedman agreed to dismiss her complaint; she then filed a
            motion for $1 million in attorneys' fees based on her assertion
            that the complaint benefited the company by causing XTO to adopt
            the Section 162(m) plan. The chancery court rejected Freedman's
            suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Waste claims, the court said, usually involve a transaction
            in which a corporation allegedly exchanges its assets for
            'disproportionately low consideration. To state a claim for
            waste, a stockholder must allege, with particularity, that the
            board authorized action that no reasonable person would consider
            fair.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Freedman v. Adams, No. 230, Delaware Supreme
            Court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;DuPont Shareholder Sues Managers Over $1 Billion Court Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A DuPont Co. (DD) shareholder sued company directors and Chief
            Executive Officer Ellen Kullman, claiming mismanagement of the
            seed business led to a $1 billion judgment that threatens to
            wipe out the company's cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed January 15 in U.S. District Court in
            Wilmington, Delaware, shareholder Robert Zomolosky asked a judge
            to force Kullman and the board to pay any damages stemming from
            DuPont's loss of a patent lawsuit involving Monsanto Co. (MON)'s weed
            killer, Roundup. The jury award, the third-biggest last year,
            could grow to $3 billion depending on future legal rulings,
            according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The DuPont board lost sight of its mandate and its
            responsibilities, and acquiesced in unlawful legal maneuvers and
            deceptive public statements in conscious disregard of its
            obligations,' Zomolosky claimed in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wilmington-based company plans to appeal the jury's
            verdict, according to the complaint, and has asked the judge to
            overturn the award. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DuPont's General Counsel Thomas L. Sager said in an e-
            mailed statement that the company handled the Monsanto patent
            case appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are confident in the appropriateness of all our
            actions and the points raised in this lawsuit are simply a
            repetition of those we have repeatedly addressed in the course
            of the Monsanto litigation,' Sager said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Zomolosky v. Kullman, 13-cv-00094, U.S.
            District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Law Firm Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Clifford Chance in Australia Hires Antitrust Lawyer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dave Poddar, an antitrust lawyer who advised Emirates on a
            proposed joint venture with Qantas Airways Ltd., has joined
            Clifford Chance, the U.K.'s highest-grossing law firm, in its
            Sydney office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clifford Chance is boosting its workforce in the Asia-
            Pacific region, where its revenue rose 28 percent in the year
            ended April 30, helped by offices in Sydney and Perth added in
            2011 and a new alliance in Singapore last year. Poddar joined
            Jan. 7, according to a statement from the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Adding dedicated antitrust expertise has been a priority
            since our establishment in Australia,' Peter Charlton, Clifford
            Chance's Asia Pacific managing partner, said in a statement.
            'When overseas clients invest in Australia, or local companies

            to arise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The value of mergers and acquisitions in Australia slumped
            41 percent to $86 billion last year from 2011 and compared with
            $148.8 billion in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            The slowdown during the past two years doesn't mean there's a
            lack of work for competition lawyers, with companies planning
            six to 12 months in advance, Poddar said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Concentration in Australian industries from news media to
            retail mean tie-ups and acquisitions face regulatory scrutiny,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For competition lawyers giving strategic advice, there is
            plenty of work,' Poddar said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Poddar worked at Mallesons Stephen Jaques for 22 years, and
            in 2011 joined Allen Overy, which he left last year. He
            declined to discuss his departure from Allen Overy. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Stanley Hartt was hired by Norton Rose LLP in Canada from
            Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)'s Canadian unit, where he was chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hartt, a former chief of staff to former Canadian Prime
            Minister Brian Mulroney, will provide 'strategic advice to

            announcement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hartt left Macquarie and joined Norton Rose's Toronto
            office this month, Peter Zvanitajs, a spokesman for Norton Rose
            said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mulroney, Canada's Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993, is
            listed as a senior partner in Montreal on Norton Rose's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stephen Yan, a Macquarie spokesman, declined to comment on

        <headline>Modi Vows to Curb Prices While Promising India 100 Smart Cities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;India's top opposition leader
            Narendra Modi promised voters cheaper goods and 100 'smart
            cities' in unveiling steps to boost Asia's third-biggest
            economy as he seeks to unseat the ruling Congress party. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party will create a stabilization
            fund to combat Asia's fastest inflation and form special courts
            to try those who hoard goods, he said in New Delhi yesterday. A
            Modi-led government would also improve the rail network and
            power supply in the world's second-most populous nation, he told
            thousands of party workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The country has never witnessed such a debacle before,'
            Modi, the chief minister of western Gujarat state, said at the
            end of a three-day party meeting to devise a strategy to win
            elections due by May. 'The 2014 elections are not just for a
            change of government, but a fresh ray of hope for Indians.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Modi is seeking to harness voter anger over higher prices
            of everything from onions to medicine to win power in a nation
            where more than 800 million people live on less than $2 per day.
            The focus on economic issues also helps draw the spotlight away
            from criticism from opponents who accuse him of complicity in
            2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, which killed more than 1,000
            people and left Modi barred from entering the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Modi is a natural communicator, and his ability to take
            the conversation forward is helping people forget about his
            past,' said N. Bhaskara Rao, chairman of the New Delhi-based
            Centre for Media Studies. 'He's now batting with a huge lead
            and his electoral feet are firmly set.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Majority &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Opinion polls show Modi's BJP leading Prime Minister
            Manmohan Singh's Congress party, with neither winning a
            majority. The emergence of the anti-graft Aam Aadmi Party, which
            is planning to contest the national vote after taking power in
            Delhi state last month, has added further uncertainty to the
            election outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Singh's 10-year-old government has struggled to control
            spending after implementing programs to boost rural wages and
            provide cheap food, putting India at risk of a credit-rating
            downgrade to so-called junk status. Modi said he planned to
            establish a real-time database of agriculture goods and prices
            to bring down costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ninety percent of the time, these methods of predicting
            inflation don't work because you're tailing and can't draw ahead
            of the curve,' said Rajiv Kumar, an economist and former
            secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of
            Commerce and Industry. 'The devil is really in the details.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Brand India' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a convention-style speech to cheering party leaders,
            Modi pledged to improve education and health facilities, create
            more jobs, and attract more tourists as part of building 'Brand
            India.' He called for more satellite cities to drive economic
            growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Urbanization should not be seen as a challenge, but as an
            opportunity,' Modi said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since 2001, when Modi took office, Gujarat's economy has
            grown 10.1 percent a year on average over the 11-year period
            ended March 2012, compared with 7.6 percent nationwide,
            according to the Planning Commission and data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Companies such as Ford Motor Co. (F) and Reliance
            Industries Ltd. announced investments in the state in that time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It'll be very, very difficult for Modi to replicate the
            Gujarat model unless the BJP gets an absolute majority in the
            elections,' said Satish Misra, a political analyst at the
            Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based policy group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Sacrifice' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his speech, Modi also took swipes at Rahul Gandhi, the
            Congress party's vice president whose family has dominated
            Indian politics for more than six decades. His mother Sonia
            Gandhi, the party's president, overruled other senior leaders
            last week who wanted Rahul named as the party's formal prime
            minister candidate to counter Modi. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When defeat is imminent, which mother will sacrifice her
            son,' Modi said, referring to Sonia and Rahul. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Congress leaders have sought to discredit Modi, with Singh
            saying earlier this month that Modi 'would be disastrous for
            the country' and presided over a 'mass massacre.' A party
            resolution last week said communal forces threaten 'to rupture
            the very basic fabric of our nation's unity and social
            cohesion.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The riots followed the killing of Hindu activists in a
            train fire, a blaze for which Muslims were later found guilty.
            While human rights groups accuse Modi of failing to control
            subsequent violence, he denies wrongdoing and a Supreme Court-appointed panel found no evidence that he made
            decisions that
            prevented victims from receiving help. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dynasty &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Modi didn't mention the riots and avoided statements that
            would appeal to BJP stalwarts who favor a more predominate role
            for Hinduism in India. Hindus make up about 80 percent of the
            population, with Muslims accounting for 13 percent, according to
            the CIA World Factbook. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Modi instead attacked India's dynastic politics without
            referring to the Gandhis by name. Rahul Gandhi's great-grandfather, grandmother and father all served as
            prime
            ministers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They think it is below their dignity to fight against a
            person who was born in a backward class, one whose mother used
            to clean dishes in the neighborhood, a person who used to sell
            tea in railway compartments,' Modi said, referring to himself.
            'Those having prominent surnames feel it insulting to fight
            against those who are known for their work.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gupta Says in Appeal Trial Judge Hampered Defense Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) director
            Rajat Gupta asked a federal appeals court for a new insider-
            trading trial, arguing that evidence in his favor was kept from
            the jury and evidence against him was wrongly allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gupta, 64, who sat on the board of New York-based Goldman
            Sachs and Cincinnati-based Procter Gamble Co., was sentenced
            to two years in prison after being convicted of passing
            information he gathered at board meetings to Galleon Group LLC
            co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan erred when he
            allowed the government to present wiretaps of conversations not
            involving Gupta and limited Gupta's defense case by barring
            evidence that Rajaratnam had alternative sources of nonpublic
            information about Goldman Sachs, defense lawyers Gary Naftalis
            and Seth Waxman said Jan. 18 in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The court's decidedly asymmetrical interpretation of the
            rules of evidence left the jury with a distorted picture, in
            which Gupta was accused by the self-serving hearsay of a known
            fabulist beyond Gupta's power to cross-examine, but was unable
            to explain to the jury that he had neither the motive nor the
            inclination to benefit that person, and that there was a
            plausible alternative perpetrator,' the defense lawyers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Remains Free &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a rare move, a federal appeals court in Manhattan in
            December granted Gupta's request to remain free while he fights
            his conviction. Rakoff, who presided over the trial, originally
            ordered Gupta to begin serving his sentence on Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rakoff 'significantly curtailed' Gupta's principal
            defenses and made erroneous rulings in the prosecution's favor
            that 'decisively tipped the scales' against him, Gupta argued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gupta challenged the government's use of court-authorized
            wiretaps, saying Rakoff shouldn't have permitted prosecutors to
            play recordings of September and October 2008 telephone calls
            between Rajaratnam and others that didn't include Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wiretaps Attacked &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The prosecution's case rested exclusively on
            circumstantial evidence and predominantly wiretap statements --
            not of Gupta, but of Rajaratnam, a highly unreliable declarant,
            speaking with other people with no connection to Gupta,' his
            lawyers wrote. 'The district court admitted these hearsay
            statements -- which Gupta could not cross-examine given
            Rajaratnam's unavailability.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyers argued that Rakoff wrongly allowed
            prosecutors to use three recordings of telephone calls in which
            Gupta wasn't a participant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rakoff also erred when he didn't allow Gupta's daughter to
            testify that he told her he had discovered that Rajaratnam had
            'swindled' him when he'd withdrawn money from the fund. Gupta
            lost $10 million, his lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rajaratnam's Sentence &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term for insider
            trading at the Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayers,
            Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gupta, who also served as managing partner of McKinsey
            Co. from 1994 to 2003, was convicted by a jury in June of one
            count of conspiracy and three counts of securities fraud. He was
            accused of passing illegal information about New York-based
            Goldman Sachs to Rajaratnam, his friend and business partner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Manhattan convicted Gupta of twice
            passing information about Goldman Sachs to Rajaratnam, once on
            Sept. 23, 2008, and again on Oct. 23, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 12-4448, U.S. Court of Appeals
            for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bitcoin Targets Payments Business of Giants Visa to JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley to Wall Street say they don't care much for Bitcoin as a currency
            to supplant the U.S. dollar. As a payment technology they could use to undercut Visa Inc. (V), Western Union
            Co. (WU) or Citigroup Inc. (C), they say they like it a lot more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Bitcoin's value
            gyrates, these investors have said that the headlines about its price and chatter about which retailers
            accept it obscure the real merit of what Satoshi Nakamoto, the name given to the anonymous person or people
            who created Bitcoin, delivered five years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'At some point, I had an 'aha!' moment
            and realized that Bitcoin was best understood as a new software protocol through which you could rebuild the
            payments industry in ways that are better and cheaper,' Chris Dixon, a partner at Menlo Park,
            California-based venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is
            Bitcoin Real Money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin enthusiasts say they are building a system to move money
            across the Internet securely and at a lower cost than existing wire transfers, bank debits or remittances.
            If they can eliminate the friction created by middlemen and create easy-to-use consumer tools, Bitcoin
            businesses may claim a piece of the revenue and still deliver lower costs. &lt;/p&gt;

            and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) jumped more than 4.4 percent in regular trading after
            earnings topped estimates. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) surged 11 percent after revenue beat forecasts,
            helped by sales of chips that run servers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's 500 Index gained 0.2

            Watkins LLP advised Spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CCPT II will exchange 1.9 shares for each share of Spirit
            common stock, the Arizona-based companies said in a statement
            today. Spirit shareholders will own about 44 percent of the
            combined real estate investment trust with the remainder held by
            CCPT II shareholders. Shares of the joint company will be listed
            on the New York Stock Exchange under Spirit's stock symbol. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pro-forma enterprise value of the new company is about
            $7.1 billion, and the acquisition will create the second-largest
            publicly traded triple-net lease REIT in the U.S., according to
            the statement. The combined company will be led by Spirit's
            management. Seven of the nine board members will be from Spirit,
            it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goodwin Procter deal team was led by Gil Menna and
            included partners Suzanne Lecaroz, John Haggerty, Andrew Sucoff,
            Mark Opper and Samuel Richardson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ropes Gray partners on the deal are John Loder,
            investment management; Amanda Morrison, corporate; and Peter
            Welsh, business and securities litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Latham Watkins LLP's corporate deal team consists of Los
            Angeles partners Julian Kleindorfer and Bradley Helms and Orange
            County partner Charles Ruck. Advice was also provided by New
            York finance partner David Teh; Chicago real estate partner
            Robert Buday; Los Angeles tax partners Michael Brody and Ana
            O'Brien; and Los Angeles benefits and compensation partner David Taub. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to be completed in the third
            quarter, according to the statement. Triple-net lease structures
            mean the tenant is responsible for paying all the property's
            costs including maintenance, property taxes, utilities and
            insurance, minimizing expenses for the REIT. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Prudential Loses U.K. Top Court Ruling on Privileged Tax Advice &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. Supreme Court said tax advice given to Prudential
            Plc (PRU) by accountants wasn't protected by legal privilege and
            should be disclosed to the British government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K.'s highest court said only advice from lawyers was
            protected by the privilege, according to a press summary of the
            judgment today. When tax authorities asked Prudential for
            information about a tax avoidance scheme created by
            PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company argued it didn't have to
            hand over any documents containing advice from accountants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Accountants will be crying into their soup tonight, and
            tax lawyers will be dancing in the streets,' said Peter Clough,
            a partner at U.K. law firm Osborne Clarke. 'The case presents a
            clear cut choice for clients: if you want confidential tax
            advice, you're better off going to a law firm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies including Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Google Inc. (GOOG) have
            been criticized by lawmakers for trying to reduce their U.K. tax
            liabilities with complex accounting methods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prudential spokesman Robin Tozer and PwC spokeswoman
            Laetitia Lynn declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Jones Day Appoints New Office Heads in Tokyo, San Francisco &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jones Day announced that Masatomo Suzuki has been named
            partner-in-charge of the firm's Tokyo office. He succeeds Nobu
            Yamanouchi, who has been partner-in-charge in Tokyo since 2008.
            Yamanouchi will continue to advise clients, particularly in the
            automotive, electronic, and pharmaceutical industries, in cross-
            border mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and other
            corporate matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aaron Agenbroad, a partner in Jones Day's labor and
            employment practice, has been named to succeed Bob Mittelstaedt
            as partner-in-charge of the San Francisco office. The firm also
            announced that David Kiernan, a partner in the U.S. business and
            tort litigation practice, will become the administrative partner
            of the San Francisco office, responsible for the day to day
            operation of the office. Kiernan replaces Louise Rankin, who
            left Jones Day to become general counsel of ABHOW, a housing and
            health care provider for senior citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As head of the real estate practice in Tokyo, Suzuki has
            experience representing major Japanese real estate companies as
            well as foreign companies and funds involved in real estate
            transactions in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As partner-in-charge, Agenbroad will be responsible for the
            overall leadership, strategic vision, and management of Jones
            Day's San Francisco office. His labor and employment practice
            has a focus on representing corporate clients in complex labor
            and employment disputes. Mittelstaedt, who has served as
            partner-in-charge since 2006, has been asked to assume new
            responsibilities coordinating and expanding the firm's
            litigation practices in California. He has more than 30 years of
            experience as a trial lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Department of Defense GC Johnson Returns to Paul Weiss &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jeh Charles Johnson, the former general counsel of the
            Department of Defense, has returned to private practice as a
            partner in Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton Garrison LLP's
            litigation department in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are so proud of Jeh's public service and of his
            contributions to our nation,' Paul, Weiss chairman Brad S. Karp
            said in a statement. 'We are thrilled to welcome a lawyer of
            his distinction back to our partnership.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Johnson was appointed to his post by President Barack Obama
            in February 2009. As chief legal officer at the Defense
            Department, he oversaw the work of more than 10,000 lawyers. His
            accomplishments during four years in the post included handling
            reforms to the military commissions system adopted by Congress
            in 2009, co-authoring the report that paved the way for the
            repeal of the military's 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' policy by
            Congress in 2010, and overseeing the military's counterterrorism
            policies, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move marks the third time Johnson has returned to the
            firm after leaving for government posts. In 1998, he was
            appointed by President Bill Clinton to be general counsel of the
            Air Force. He held that position for 27 months and returned to
            Paul, Weiss in January 2001. In 1989, Johnson left Paul, Weiss
            to become an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan, where he
            prosecuted public corruption cases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a privilege and a pleasure to return to my
            professional home, Paul, Weiss, and I look forward to rejoining
            my partners and serving the firm's clients,' Johnson said in
            the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul, Weiss has more than 700 lawyers at eight offices in
            the U.S., Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;WilmerHale Hires Ex-Federal Circuit Judge Gajarsa in Boston &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP hired Arthur J.
            Gajarsa, formerly a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
            Federal Circuit, in its Boston office. Gajarsa joins the firm as
            senior counsel in the intellectual property litigation practice
            and will provide counsel to the firm's clients on IP-related
            issues. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gajarsa was nominated to the Federal Circuit in 1996 by
            President Clinton and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1997. He
            retired in June 2012. Prior to his appointment, Gajarsa was a
            litigator who also practiced corporate law. His worked at the
            Commerce Department, the Interior Department and Defense
            Department, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WilmerHale's IP litigation practice has more than 140
            lawyers and technology specialists with scientific or technical
            degrees. The firm has more than 1,000 lawyers at offices in 12
            cities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Linklaters Appoints Banking and Restructuring Partner in Spain &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish banking lawyer Juan Barona joined Linklaters LLP's
            Madrid office from Allen Overy LLP where he was a partner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our banking practice, and the Madrid office as a whole,
            has enjoyed significant success over the last few years. The
            addition of Juan to our team is the result of such success and
            is an appropriate and timely response to our commitment to best
            serve our clients' demands,' Sebasti'n Albella, Linklaters
            senior partner for Spain, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Linklaters finance practice in Spain covers restructuring
            work, leveraged financing, corporate financing, equity and debt
            capital markets and other matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Linklaters opened an office in Spain in 2000. The firm has
            a team of about 100 lawyers in its Spanish office. The firm has
            lawyers at 28 offices worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Edwards Wildman Hires Hogan Lovells Public Finance Partner &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alethia N. Nancoo joined Edwards Wildman Palmer LLP as a
            partner in the Public Finance Department, in the firm's
            Washington office. She was previously with of Hogan Lovells LLP,
            where she was a partner in the infrastructure, project and

            &lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Glaxo Plaintiff Lawyers Settle Dispute Over $143 Million in Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers who won what may be a $2.3 billion settlement with
            GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) over its Avandia diabetes drug resolved
            their own fight over the allocation of almost $144 million in
            legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eight lawyers on a court-appointed fee committee agreed to
            take a smaller portion of the fee fund after nine objectors
            challenged their payouts, a special master assigned to review
            the recommendations said in court papers made public Jan. 18 in
            federal court in Philadelphia. The fee committee had asked for
            71 percent of the fund set aside by U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe for the Avandia cases before her. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Allocating a limited pot of common benefit fees among
            numerous counsel, all of whom are talented and capable attorneys
            and many of whom have made a significant contribution to the
            ultimate success of (a) case, is an unenviable task that is sure
            to lead to hurt feelings and bruised egos,' Bruce Merenstein,
            the special master, wrote in the filing. 'Yet, all of the
            parties involved handled this difficult task with care and
            equanimity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fee fund is 6.25 percent of the total settlement,
            according to court records. That means the total accord may be
            worth $2.3 billion and the average payout for the 40,000 users
            of Avandia involved in the litigation would be about $57,500 --
            before legal fees. People familiar with the settlement, who
            didn't want to be named because the terms weren't public, have
            said the fee fund was 7 percent of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Glaxo, the U.K.'s biggest drugmaker, has said it paid more
            than $3 billion to settle federal and state government claims
            that it illegally marketed Avandia, once the world's best-
            selling diabetes pill, and other medications. Company officials
            haven't said what the drugmaker spent to settle the Avandia
            lawsuits before Rufe, and in state courts, alleging executives
            failed to properly warn consumers about the drug's risks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fee-advisory group, led by Philadelphia attorney Dianne Nast, agreed to a lower payout as part
            of the accord. Nast
            agreed to take $6.3 million, down from $6.7 million, according
            to court papers. Joseph Zonies, a Denver-based attorney who was
            slated to get the highest recommended fee, will see his firm's
            payout reduced to $22.5 million from $24.4 million for 18,232
            hours of work. Vance Andrus, another Denver-based lawyer, saw
            the biggest reduction, a cut of about $3 million that left him
            with a payout of $14.6 million, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other lawyers in the group, including Thomas Cartmell,
            Bryan Aylstock, Stephen Corr, Paul Kiesel and Bill Robins III
            all agreed to reductions from about $700,000 to $1.3 million
            each, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight law firms are seeking payment from the fund for
            common benefit work. The proposed payout for 41 firms that did
            not object will remain unchanged, Merenstein said in the filing.
            The allocation is subject to final approval from Rufe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consolidated case is In re Avandia Marketing, Sales
            Practices and Products Liability Litigation, 07-01871, U.S.
            District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

            Exchange Commission, says former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White,
            now a partner at Debevoise Plimpton LLP, would be a tough and

        <headline>JPMorgan Raised to Buy, Goldman Lowered by Deutsche Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) had its price
            target and recommendation raised by Deutsche Bank AG while
            investors were advised to hold on to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            following its 48 percent stock-price rise since Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares have lagged 30 percent behind global banks
            since early August, analysts led by Matthew O'Connor wrote in a
            research note by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan, which
            reported its third record year of profits with $21.3 billion in
            net income last year, may see annual operating expenses drop as
            much as $5 billion in coming years partly because costs to
            service mortgages will drop, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think JPM is the best-positioned market-sensitive bank
            for a pickup in consumer loan growth,' O'Connor wrote,
            referring to New York-based JPMorgan by its stock ticker.
            Deutsche Bank upgraded JPMorgan to buy from hold and raised its
            12-month price target to $53 from $48. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank lowered Goldman Sachs to hold from buy
            because the New York-based bank is trading close to its 12-month
            price target of $144. The firm doesn't have the same
            opportunities for cost savings as JPMorgan, and is trading at a
            premium to other large investment banks, O'Connor said in the
            note. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>S&amp;amp;P 500 Earnings Beat at 75% Pace as Ford Offsets Apple</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Ford Motor Co. (F) led
            U.S. companies that topped analysts' earnings estimates today,
            amid rising consumer confidence and buoyant demand for new
            products -- from pickups to cable-TV packages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drug manufacturer and carmaker are among the 75 percent
            of Standard Poor's 500 Index companies that have exceeded
            analysts' projections this season so far, with more than 350
            that have yet to report. Profit at SP 500 companies probably
            rose 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, and sales
            increased 2.3 percent, estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford benefited from sales of F-Series pickups in the U.S.
            and the Focus compact car in China. Pfizer, the world's
            biggest drugmaker, cut costs to boost earnings. While Apple
            Inc.'s profit also beat estimates, the Cupertino, California-based company posted iPhone sales for the
            holiday season
            that missed analysts' projections yesterday, a sign it needs
            new products to fuel growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly climbed to a
            five-month high in January, according to data released by the
            the Conference Board today, as optimism about the economy and
            labor market improved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The labor market has been the key variable for the
            consumer for a very long time and people have generally been
            feeling a little bit better over the last three to six months
            because the unemployment rate has been falling,' Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC
            in Stamford,
            Connecticut, said before the report. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;All but one of the 14 health-care companies in the SP that
            have reported exceeded earnings' projections, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. Almost 56 percent of consumer-discretionary
            companies and 87 percent of information-technology businesses
            posted higher-than-estimated earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), the largest U.S. cable company, also
            reported results today. Although earnings missed estimates,
            sales were higher than projected as the Philadelphia-based
            company added TV subscribers for the first time in more than six
            years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the companies that topped estimates in the past week
            were Microsoft Corp., helped by sales of game consoles and cloud
            software, and Netflix Inc., which surged to a stock-price record
            after projecting higher-than-estimated customer growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies that fell short in terms of sales included
            International Business Machines Corp., while Johnson Johnson,
            the world's biggest maker of health-care products, forecast 2014
            earnings that was lower than analysts anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A majority of SP 500 companies -- 71 percent -- have yet
            to report earnings, including Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) today, followed by
            Boeing Co. (BA), Dow Chemical Co. and Facebook Inc. (FB) tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last season, 74 percent of SP 500 companies beat earnings
            estimates and 53 percent exceeded sales projections. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Hires JPMorgan's Nuttall to Multi Asset Team</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSGEPPA) hired Neill Nuttall from JPMorgan Asset Management to join
            its multi asset investment strategy team. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuttall was appointed co-chief investment
            officer of Goldman's Global Portfolio Solutions Group and chairman of the GPS investment committee. He
            joined the firm in June and is based in London, said a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirming his
            appointment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuttall left JPMorgan in April after 30 years at the firm, where he most
            recently headed the Global Multi Asset Group, or GMAG, which oversees about $153 billion. JPMorgan last
            month appointed John Bilton from Bank of America Corp. to head the global strategy team, a role Nuttall also
            previously covered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are delighted to have further strengthened our investment team
            with the recent appointment of Neill,' Andrew Wilson, Goldman Sachs Asset Management's CEO for Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, said by e-mail. 'With over 30 years of investment experience, Neill will serve as
            the head of all of our investment activities, overseeing strategic and tactical allocation' for the GPS
            Group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firms including Invesco Perpetual and Aviva Investors have sought to capitalize
            on the growing demand for multi asset investing, where money is deployed across asset classes from equities
            to infrastructure. Two-thirds of money managers expect multi-asset investment strategies will be the biggest
            contributor to growth in the next three years, according to a State Street Corp. survey last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's GPS Group team includes about 70 globally. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Microsoft's Support for Gays Pressures States</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Support for gay marriage by companies as varied as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Microsoft Corp.
            (MSFT) and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) is gathering steam to change policies in states that bar same-sex couples
            from tying the knot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two U.S. Supreme Court decisions on June 26 heartened supporters of
            the cause while showing an increased willingness of business to back the effort. In one case, more than 200
            companies signed a brief against a federal law that denied benefits to same-sex couples. Five years ago,
            only a handful had lobbied against California's Proposition 8 ban on same-sex marriages, the target of the
            high court's other decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;State legislators stand to feel the heat as more businesses
            speak out against laws in states including Texas, Florida and Michigan that recognize only heterosexual
            marriage. While fewer than half the companies in the Standard Poor's 500 (SPX) are based in states that
            allow gays to wed, most already have policies that ban discrimination based on sexual orientation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Companies do have the choice where they locate, where they set up shop,' said Kellie McElhaney,
            founding faculty director of the Center for Responsible Business at the University of California Berkeley.
            Local policies on sexual orientation 'will eventually become part of the choice process.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Longer-Term Treasuries Rise as Jobs Growth Doesn't Sway Fed View</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Longer-term Treasuries rose, pushing 10-and 30-year yields lower amid speculation an uptick in
            inflation and acceleration in the U.S. job market won't be enough to pressure the Federal Reserve into
            raising rates soon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The yield on the 30-year bond dropped for the first time in four
            days even as a report last week showed U.S. employers added more jobs in June than forecast and the
            unemployment rate dropped to an almost six-year low. The difference between the yields on five-year notes
            and 30-year bonds narrowed to 1.70 percentage points before the Fed releases minutes of its June meeting on
            July 9. The U.S. will sell $61 billion in notes and bonds this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Even though data
            has been looking a little better, the jury is still out on if it will lead to momentum in the second half,'
            said George Goncalves, the head of interest-rate strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., one of the 22 primary
            dealers that trade directly with the Fed. 'The back end is a comfortable place for investors to be.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 30-year bond yield dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.44 percent at 5
            pm New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.375 percent bond maturing in May 2044
            rose 19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 27/32. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Market Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 10-year yield fell three basis points to 2.61 percent after rising 10 basis points last week.
            The five-year yield was little changed at 1.73 percent while the three-year yield rose one basis point to
            0.97 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week's note and bond sales will consist of $27 billion of three-year
            Treasuries tomorrow, $21 billion of 10-year notes on July 9 and $13 billion of 30-year debt on July 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Aggressive buyers want to move out the curve a bit,' said Guy Haselmann, an interest-rate
            strategist in New York at primary dealer Bank of Nova Scotia. He forecasts the 30-year yield will drop below
            3.29 percent before the end of summer, and under 3 percent by year-end as investors 'question people's rosy
            outlook for growth and inflation.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference between the yields on five-year notes
            and 30-year bonds touched 1.67 percentage points on June 18, the narrowest since September 2009. During the
            period, it widened to as much as 3.11 percentage points in November 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global
            Markets &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The extra yield that 10-year Treasuries offer over their Group-of-Seven
            counterparts expanded one basis point to 72 basis points, almost the most since April 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Treasuries
            still look attractive against a lot of comparable markets,' said Larry Milstein, managing director in New
            York of government-debt trading at R.W. Pressprich Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is recovering after
            contracting at a rate of as much as 8.3 percent at the worst of the recession that began in December 2007
            and ended in June 2009. The economy added 288,000 jobs in June, compared with the 215,000 projected by a
            Bloomberg News survey of analysts. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.1 percent, a six-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers have kept their target for overnight lending between banks in a range of zero to 0.25
            percent since December 2008. The central bank will publish the minutes of its June 17-18 meeting on July 9.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traders see about a 78 percent chance officials will raise the key rate from near zero
            by September 2015, fed funds futures show. That's up from 56 percent at the end of May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fed
            Watch &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The front end will re-price to a level consistent with when the market thinks
            the first rate hike will take place,' Haselmann of Scotia said. 'We have no better visibility than the Fed.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank will increase its benchmark interest-rate target in the third quarter
            of 2015, rather than the first three months of 2016, according to a report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The
            bank joins JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in moving up its Fed estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY) dropped 0.15 percent in the month ended July 4. The
            Bloomberg Global Developed Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV) gained 0.8 percent, reflecting trader expectations
            for Europe and Japan to keep borrowing costs at record lows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the relative calm that
            is the market for U.S. Treasuries, a sense of unease over a vital cog in the financial system's plumbing is
            beginning to rise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed's bond purchases combined with demand from banks to meet
            tightened regulatory requirements is making it harder for traders to easily borrow and lend certain desired
            securities in the $1.6 trillion-a-day market for repurchase agreements. That's causing such trades to go
            uncompleted at some of the highest rates since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such failures to
            deliver Treasuries have averaged $65.6 billion a week this year, reaching as much as $197.6 billion in the
            week ended June 18, Fed data show. Uncompleted trades averaged $51.6 billion in 2013, and $28.8 billion in
            2012, according to the Fed. In those cases, the borrower pays a 3 percent penalty. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Canada Pins Fresh Tech Hopes on Quantum Computing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When a recruiter called former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Vern Brownell in 2009 about
            heading up D-Wave Systems Inc., a Canadian startup in the nascent field of quantum computing, he almost hung
            up the phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brownell, who had spent 11 years at Goldman Sachs (GS) as the New York
            bank's chief technology officer, had grown cynical from startups pitching for a sliver of the billion
            dollars a year Goldman spends on technology. A quantum computer, which uses the building blocks of matter
            itself to drive calculations, sounded like science fiction. Yet D-Wave was about to build one. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once I came out here and saw what they were doing, I said 'I've got to do this,'' Brownell said in
            a recent telephone interview. 'I had never seen anything that had the potential to disrupt the computing
            industry the way this had.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four years later, Brownell is D-Wave's chief executive
            officer, the firm has secured more than C$100 million ($95 million) in investment from backers including
            Goldman (GS) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN). founder Jeff Bezos and counts Lockheed Martin Co. (LMT), and a lab
            run by Google Inc (GOOG). and NASA as its customers. Along with BlackBerry smartphone inventor Mike
            Lazaridis, who has poured nearly half a billion dollars into quantum science in Waterloo, Ontario, D-Wave is
            creating a second act for a Canadian technology sector known more recently for Nortel Networks Corp
            (NRTLQ).'s bankruptcy and BlackBerry's struggles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Steven Mandis, a Nasty Neighborhood's Mr. Rogers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Steven Mandis was working on a book about whether Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) put profit above
            principles when he hit upon a new way to make money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The former Goldman Sachs banker
            decided two years ago to get into lending money to struggling small businesses, a niche on Wall Street where
            brokers offer loans with interest rates that can climb past 100 percent to dentists with bad credit and
            pizzeria owners behind on their bills. To some, it's the new face of subprime. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few of
            the people Mandis met on his search for investment opportunities had trouble relating to a banker who
            vacations in the Bahamas and describes himself as intellectually curious. His reference to a Goldman Sachs
            connection fell flat at a call center in midtown Manhattan. He was the only person wearing a blazer at a
            brokerage whose co-founder was sentenced to probation for insider trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            Wall Street Finds New Subprime With 125% Business Loans

            Young Bankers Seek 'Good Yield' With Their Own Nonprofits
            &lt;p&gt;Mandis, 44, wasn't shaken. He invested in two lenders before starting his own firm, Kalamata
            Capital LLC, late last year. In October, Harvard Business Review Press published his book, 'What Happened to
            Goldman Sachs,' which describes the firm drifting from the doctrine of putting clients first. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If I'm going to do something, I want to focus on a really big problem so it would mean something,'
            Mandis said. 'And small businesses, I mean, this is the heart of everything.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rushing
            In &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Small-business lending has yet to recover from the financial crisis. Loans of less
            than $1 million are down 22 percent from 2007 because of tighter lending standards, Federal Reserve research
            shows. Even as banks have pulled back from funding businesses directly, Wall Street investors funneled at
            least $1.7 billion in financing over the past two years to the high-rate lenders rushing in to fill the gap,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors seeing a chance to profit from the
            risky loans include Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management LLC, early Facebook Inc. backer Accel Partners
            and Doug Naidus, a former head of mortgages at Deutsche Bank AG, whose World Business Lenders LLC charges as
            much as 125 percent. RapidAdvance, one of the companies Mandis invested in, was sold in September to
            Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert's private-equity firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Businesses that take the
            loans often have bad credit, little collateral or maxed-out credit cards. Borrowing at high rates can
            trigger bankruptcy instead of growth for entrepreneurs who lack alternatives. The unlicensed brokers who
            target them with cold calls are paid more the higher rates go. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is like a payday
            loan for a business,' said Pat Fossett, a bankruptcy lawyer in Corpus Christi, Texas, making a comparison to
            costly cash advances for workers. 'Unless they're making a large profit to pay that high interest, they're
            shooting themselves in the foot.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Olive Branch &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way Mandis
            describes it, while some of his business-lending competitors may take advantage of borrowers in distress,
            he's driven by something loftier than profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's this obligation to try to do
            something to solve a problem in America in my own way,' he said. 'Providing capital to people to grow their
            businesses and to give jobs to people is I think a good thing.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis said he's funding
            Kalamata entirely with his own money and that he chose the name because of his family's Greek heritage to
            evoke an olive branch extended to customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheila Stiles was one of his first. Her
            family has collected used motor oil from auto shops in Tennessee and turned it into fuel for more than 60
            years. She said they try to run Goins Waste Oil Co. by Christian principles. With business dropping, they
            took a Kalamata loan in November because they didn't want layoffs before Christmas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Like
            Family' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Everybody here is family except for two people, and they're like family
            because we've known them all our lives,' said Stiles, the Chattanooga-based company's treasurer. 'The way
            they present it, it's so tempting, especially when you know you're in such a bind.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stiles
            said she sought out Lendio, an online platform that matches borrowers and lenders, which referred her to
            Kalamata. Goins borrowed $122,000, agreeing to pay back $165,920 in about 11 months, according to a copy of
            the contract. While Stiles was aware of the loan terms, she said they turned out to be more onerous than she
            thought. Goins furloughed employees so it could afford the sums that Kalamata took daily and then weekly
            from the company's bank account, she added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I don't think it's fair,' Stiles said.
            'He's taking advantage of the small-business owners because of the interest rate that he charges.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Pretty Aggressive' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Goins contract shows a rate of 36 percent. When
            calculated as an effective annual percentage rate -- like the ones credit-card or mortgage loans are legally
            required to disclose -- it would jump to 72 percent, said Marco Lucioni, a vice president at nonprofit
            lender Opportunity Fund. The U.S. Truth in Lending Act requires that rate be stated on loans to consumers,
            not businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Every time you make a payment you're reducing the amount of money you
            had available to work with,' said Lucioni, whose nonprofit group helps entrepreneurs find affordable loans.
            'When I'm telling you a dollar amount you have to pay on a daily basis, that's always going to sound so
            little and affordable. Don't fall for these gimmicks.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asked about his rates, Mandis
            said more than 20 percent 'would be high for us.' The Goins case was an exception because the borrowers run
            a seasonal business, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Stiles and Mandis were interviewed for this story,
            Stiles complained to Kalamata. The company told her she could pay back the loan more slowly, lowering her
            payments by about $1,000 a week, she said in a second call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Although we had no legal
            obligation to do so, we did this without imposing any penalty,' Mandis said. 'We hold ourselves to the
            highest ethical standards and compliance with applicable lending laws.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Forever Yogurt
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandy Calara, who runs the Forever Yogurt frozen-yogurt chain in Chicago, said his
            Kalamata loan worked out. He borrowed to cover payroll and rent in November when harsh weather cut demand.
            Calara said he found Kalamata through another online platform called Biz2Credit and doesn't remember the
            terms of his deal. He didn't have time to apply for a bank loan, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's sort of
            the best of the bad loans,' Calara said. 'It was still pretty aggressive as far as what our deal was.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mandis said he wants to make his company the first that small-business owners call when they need
            financing. So far, Kalamata is still a small business itself, with two employees in Bethesda, Maryland. It
            has provided $6 million, he said, to borrowers including a Georgia gas station, a Florida doctor and a donut
            shop in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Eye-Popping' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kalamata sued the owner of a New
            Jersey liquor store for defaulting after borrowing $100,000 in February. The eight-month loan, which shows a
            17 percent rate in its contract, effectively costs 53 percent a year, according to Opportunity Fund's
            Lucioni. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'When you put it in a percentage, it sounds big and eye-popping, but you need
            to have a relative sense of it all,' Mandis said. 'Should we let that company just go bankrupt?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mandis said the rates are justified because the businesses are risky, post little collateral and
            can't get the money elsewhere. Borrowers have an average of $3.4 million in annual revenue and 25 employees,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What Kalamata does isn't subprime lending because the term refers only to
            consumers, Mandis said, and its customers are businesses. The people who own the companies have credit
            scores on average well above subprime, he added. Sometimes the money he advances isn't really a loan at all,
            he said, it's financing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Usury Laws &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's the legal position most
            new small-business lenders take. Rather than advancing money at interest, they're buying a portion of
            someone's future sales at a discount, they say, and therefore don't have to follow state usury laws that cap
            interest rates or be licensed by state regulators. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kalamata's rates are relatively low
            for the industry, according to Rohit Arora, co-founder of Biz2Credit, who said rates have topped 200
            percent. Arora said he tries to avoid lenders who charge more than 30 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's
            both an ethical thing, but also every state has a usury law,' said Arora. 'Right now, it's not very clearly
            defined on how much small-business lending is covered.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jared Hecht, the 27-year-old
            co-founder of Fundera, an online loan marketplace that's planning to work with Kalamata, said the industry
            is 'in the first inning.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Ultimately, the good side will be that small-business owners
            should theoretically be able to run a competitive process and get the lowest rates,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Codename 'Professor' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis has long positioned himself in some of Wall
            Street's most profitable businesses. He joined Goldman Sachs's mergers and acquisitions department in 1992
            after graduating from the University of Chicago, where he was written up in the New York Times for disarming
            a gang member as part of a student patrol group. The story said he went by the codename 'Professor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He switched to the firm's Special Situations Group, whose bets with the bank's own money became so
            profitable that its head quit because his $70 million pay wasn't enough, the Wall Street Journal reported in
            2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis, who describes his career as a search for meaning and challenges, left
            Goldman Sachs in 2004 for a hedge fund, then advised consulting firm McKinsey Co. and was chief of staff to
            Citigroup Inc. (C)'s president after its bailout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If I'm choosing something to do,
            there has to be some intellectual curiosity related to it, because that's how I'm driven,' Mandis said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He enrolled in 2009 at Columbia University, where his work for a Ph.D. in sociology formed the
            basis for his book. He also teaches at the university's business school and has tutored Harlem teenagers in
            financial responsibility. In a 2010 CNN segment about Mandis, one of the high school students compared their
            sessions to taking singing classes with Beyonce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'The Opportunity' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            'What Happened to Goldman Sachs,' Mandis described how the firm adopted a legalistic approach that enabled
            it to make more money. Unlike Greg Smith, the Goldman Sachs banker who quit in 2012 and wrote a New York
            Times editorial calling the firm toxic, Mandis said he isn't blaming anyone for what he calls a slow
            cultural drift. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Of course, the sense that one is doing God's work or serving a higher
            purpose can easily transmute into a holier-than-thou attitude and an excuse for any behavior,' he wrote in
            the book. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis recalled asking colleagues about small-business loans while working at
            Citigroup. Some were skeptical. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They had heard the rates or they'd heard the word
            'subprime' associated with it somehow,' Mandis said. 'People didn't want to talk about it, focus on it. I
            also thought that was the opportunity.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Hank Who?' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He went on his
            tour of the industry in 2012 with Brian Nicholson, a vice president at Stripes Group. Nicholson, who joined
            the New York private-equity fund after co-founding a luxury menswear company named for a Cary Grant
            character, said the two of them stood out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Steve and I walk into a
            merchant-cash-advance business in midtown, and it's a total boiler room with folks dialing for dollars,'
            said Nicholson, 32, who wouldn't name the company. 'Steve, in his tweed jacket, sweater and tie, begins
            talking about his tenure at Goldman and being a resource for 'Hank' during the financial crisis. The CEO
            responds, 'Hank?' as in 'Hank who?' It was a bizarre situation.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis worked on
            special projects for Henry 'Hank' Paulson, the Goldman Sachs chief executive officer appointed Treasury
            Secretary by President George W. Bush, according to his book's author note. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also went
            downtown to one of the biggest loan brokers, Yellowstone Capital LLC. Its red-walled offices in the
            financial district used to be home to an illegal currency-trading shop run by a professional poker player.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blue Blazer &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wearing a blue blazer, Mandis walked into a call
            center full of salesmen in jeans and t-shirts, according to David Glass, the firm's co-founder, whose stint
            at a Long Island stock brokerage in the 1990s helped inspire the movie 'Boiler Room.' Mandis said he had
            millions of dollars to invest in the industry and mentioned he taught at Columbia, Glass said. The meeting
            didn't go well, he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Most new players come into the business with high-finance
            backgrounds and have trouble adjusting to guys like me,' Glass said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis wouldn't
            describe his visit to Yellowstone except to say that he met people who 'would not traditionally work at a
            Goldman Sachs or a McKinsey.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Bad Feeling' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the lenders he
            invested in was Bethesda, Maryland-based RapidAdvance, which makes businesses sign over as much as 45
            percent of their credit-card receipts in exchange for $15,000 or $18,000, according to lawsuits filed by
            RapidAdvance against borrowers who defaulted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis, who declined to say how much he
            invested, decided RapidAdvance could reach more clients with a catchy TV spot. He wanted the man who made
            the ads for J.G. Wentworth, a company that promises quick cash to lawsuit winners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mal
            Karlin, who made those spots, said he was reluctant to get involved because his small ad firm is bombarded
            by e-mail offers from lenders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Once they offer me money, I know it's going to be an
            exorbitant rate,' he said. 'I had a bad feeling about it.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis's resume persuaded
            him, he said. The banker invited the goateed director to his Park Avenue co-op to pitch ideas last year.
            Karlin was taken aback when the client's wife and two young daughters were waiting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'My
            worst nightmare is for a kid to have an idea for a commercial,' Karlin said. 'Everybody thinks that they're
            an advertising expert because they watch television.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Broadway Ditty &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            family wasn't wowed by his ideas. The director tried again when Mandis was teaching in Madrid, singing a
            Broadway ditty into the phone for him. The former banker stopped him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I like that,'
            Mandis told Karlin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the spot, which aired last year, RapidAdvance delivers sacks of
            cash after a hairdresser, mechanic and chef dance in unison and sing the company's praises. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mandis
            said he's proud of his work at that lender and his new firm. Kalamata's website features a family history
            and a photo of him in a sweater and tie. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'What I thought I would do with Kalamata is
            say, 'Here's who I am, I'm a real person,'' he said. 'You have to have the values and the brand that people
            will come back to.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Rise as Intel to Time Warner Gain Amid Deals</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to an all-time high, as companies
            from Time Warner Inc. to Intel Corp. rallied amid deals and earnings reports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time
            Warner surged 17 percent as Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox Inc. made a takeover bid that was rebuffed.
            Intel jumped 9.3 percent as its third-quarter sales forecast fueled optimism the personal-computer market is
            emerging from a two-year slump. International Business Machines Corp. rose 2.1 percent after agreeing with
            Apple Inc. to develop applications for corporate users of wireless devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Standard
            Poor's 500 Index (SPX) added 0.4 percent to 1,981.57 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow increased 77.52 points,
            or 0.5 percent, to a record 17,138.20. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies fell 0.2 percent, after
            slumping 1 percent yesterday amid Federal Reserve concerns over valuations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I think
            Yellen might have derailed a few things yesterday, but today it's back to earnings again and rightfully so,'
            Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co., which oversees $2 billion, said in a
            phone interview. 'Earnings season is a big deal and you have a couple of big names that have looked good
            with many, many to come.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fed Chair Janet Yellen said today that asset valuations in
            general aren't out of line with historical norms, after a central bank report yesterday indicated prices for
            smaller social-media and biotechnology companies are substantially stretched. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Historical
            Norms &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm not seeing alarming warning signals,' Yellen said in response to questions
            from the House Financial Services Committee. While some asset values 'may be on the high side and there may
            be some pockets where we see valuations becoming stretched,' in general 'price equity ratios and other
            measures are not outside of historical norms,' she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 7.2
            percent this year amid better-than-estimated corporate earnings and central bank stimulus. The U.S. economy
            is showing signs of recovering from a 2.9 percent contraction in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data
            today showed U.S. industrial production climbed 0.2 percent in June, capping the strongest quarter in almost
            four years. The Federal Reserve said in its Beige Book business survey released today that economic growth
            was modest to moderate in the latest period as all 12 of its districts reported stronger consumer spending
            and expanded manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equity futures climbed as a report showed China's economic
            growth accelerated for the first time in three quarters. Gross domestic product rose 7.5 percent in the
            April-June period from a year earlier, beating the 7.4 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
            economists. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'More Comfort' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You're starting to see the economy and
            leading indicators move in the direction that most people expected to start the year,' Chris Hyzy, chief
            investment officer of U.S. Trust in New York, said in a phone interview. That's leading to
            better-than-forecast earnings for economically sensitive companies, he said, while increased merger activity
            is 'emblematic of a corporate sector that has more comfort in the next couple of years.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourteen
            companies in the SP 500 including EBay Inc. and Yum! Brands Inc. are reported second-quarter results today.
            Profit by the gauge's members increased 4.5 percent in the quarter, and revenue rose 3.1 percent, according
            to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Intel Jumps &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel climbed 9.3
            percent to $34.65, the highest level since 2002. The PC market has shown signs of improvement this year as
            corporate spending picked up and U.S. shipments returned to growth. Intel's outlook indicates demand is
            starting to recover among consumers, who may be buying laptops and desktops again after years of opting for
            smartphones and tablets instead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel also added $20 billion to its stock-repurchase
            program, including $4 billion planned for the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time Warner surged 17
            percent, the most since 2000, to $83.13 for the largest gain in the SP 500. Murdoch's Twenty-First Century
            Fox is willing to pay more than $85 a share for Time Warner, according to people with knowledge of the
            matter, a sign the company is undeterred after being rebuffed in an initial offer. Fox shares fell 6.2
            percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM gained 2.1 percent. The deal with Apple enables the iPhone maker to expand
            beyond individual customers and add more corporate clients through IBM's sales force. IBM gets a boost in
            its effort to sell software and services to companies seeking to manage workers' wireless devices. Apple
            shares fell 0.6 percent, reversing an earlier rally of 1.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;International Game
            Technology jumped 9.2 percent. Rome-based Gtech SpA agreed to buy the world's biggest slot-machine maker for
            $4.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Daily Event' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. rallied 1.5
            percent. The company is in talks with potential acquirers about selling its century-old household appliances
            business, said people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This MA just seems to have taken off,
            not that it was dead before, it just seems to be almost a daily event,' said Timothy Ghriskey, chief
            investment officer at New York-based Solaris Asset Management LLC, in a phone interview. 'A bid for
            something like Time Warner, that's big news. A takeover environment creates a lift to the markets. Everyone
            is looking for the next big name.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Internet Stocks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Russell
            2000 (RTY) fell, extending its loss to 1.2 percent over that period and erasing its gain for the year, after
            the Fed said valuations for smaller social-media and biotechnology companies are substantially stretched.
            Small-caps and Internet shares were the biggest victims of a market retreat earlier this year as investors
            dumped the best performers of the bull market amid concern valuations advanced too far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Dow Jones Internet Composite Index slid 0.5 percent today. Pandora Media Inc. retreated 1.8 percent, after a
            1.2 percent loss yesterday. Groupon Inc. declined 1.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. fell 5.1
            percent as the U.S. Web portal reported second-quarter earnings and sales that fell short of analysts'
            estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index declined 1.3 percent after tumbling 2.3
            percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven of 10 main industries in the SP 500 advanced today. Energy
            companies increased 1.6 percent for the largest gain. Technology shares jumped 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            SP Supercomposite Homebuilding Index rose 1.9 percent. Homebuilder confidence in July rose more than
            forecast to the highest level in six months as growing payrolls brightening the outlook. PulteGroup Inc. and
            D.R. Horton Inc. climbed more than 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bank Shares &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Financial
            shares dropped 0.1 percent and health-care companies lost 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America
            Corp. dropped 1.9 percent. The second-biggest U.S. bank said profit declined 43 percent as it spent $4
            billion to cover litigation costs, including a mortgage settlement with American International Group Inc.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index fell 8 percent to 11.00. The gauge
            known as the VIX (VIX) jumped 17 percent last week for its biggest rally in three months, after closing July
            3 at the lowest since 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges
            today, 9.2 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Most Asian Stocks Rise, Led by Material, Before Bernanke</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Most Asian stocks rose as material
            producers advanced ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
            Bernanke's address to the U.S. Congress today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd. added 2.3 percent in Sydney after the
            world's biggest mining company said fourth-quarter iron-ore
            production gained 17 percent. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. jumped 11
            percent in Tokyo on a report the carmaker will pay its first
            dividend in 16 years. China Resources Power Holdings Co. slumped
            10 percent after a Xinhua News Agency reporter said the power
            generator and the chairman of its state-owned parent
            intentionally overpaid for a 2010 acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 135.89 as
            of 7:56 p.m. in Hong Kong, after rising as much as 0.2 percent
            and falling 0.4 percent. About five stocks rose for every four
            that fell on the measure, which closed yesterday at the highest
            level since May 29. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The primary positive driver for the global share market
            is sustained U.S. recovery,' said Matthew Sherwood, head of
            investment markets research in Sydney at Perpetual Investments,
            which manages about $25 billion. The recovery 'has removed a
            lot of downside risks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Relative Value &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Asia-Pacific measure rose 5.1 percent this year through
            yesterday, with consumer discretionary stocks leading the gain
            and energy shares falling the most among the 10 industry groups
            on the measure. The Asian benchmark gauge traded at 13.3 times
            estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 times for the Standard
            Poor's 500 Index and 13.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's Topix index added 0.2 percent. South Korea's Kospi
            index climbed 1.1 percent. Australia's SP/ASX 200 Index fell
            0.1 percent, while New Zealand's NZX 50 Index gained less than
            0.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) added 0.3 percent, while the
            Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China's
            stock exchanges, declined 1 percent. Taiwan's Taiex Index was
            little changed and Singapore's Straits Times Index lost 0.5
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures on the SP 500 were little changed. The measure
            dropped 0.4 percent in New York yesterday, halting its longest
            rally since January, as Coca-Cola Co. reported that profit fell
            4 percent, the second quarterly decline in a row. Sales were
            sapped by economic weakness in China and Europe, shifting tastes
            in the U.S. and unseasonable weather in places such as India. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bernanke Testimony &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernanke will deliver his semi-annual monetary policy
            report to Congress this week, starting today at the House
            Financial Services Committee. Fed Bank of Kansas City President
            Esther George said yesterday the U.S. was on the 'right path'
            for economic recovery and that cuts in the pace of stimulus are
            'appropriate.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Material producers gained the most among the 10 industry
            groups on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. BHP Billiton was the
            biggest support to the group, rising 2.3 percent to A$34.19 in
            Sydney after saying iron-ore output was 47.7 million metric tons
            in the three months ended June 30, from 40.9 million tons a year
            earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australian iron-ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd
            added 6 percent to A$3.71 and Anhui Conch Cement Co., a Chinese
            cement maker, rose 6.1 percent to HK$23.40 in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mitsubishi Motors &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Motors jumped 11 percent to 160 yen in Tokyo
            after the Nikkei newspaper reported the carmaker's dividend may
            exceed 10 yen for the current fiscal year, which would be the
            first dividend in 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Resources Power slumped 10 percent to HK$17.98 in
            Hong Kong after the official Xinhua News Agency posted a letter
            online from one of its reporters, Wang Wenzhi, saying that Song
            Lin, chairman of parent China Resources (Holdings) Co., overpaid
            for a 2010 acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Shenhua Energy Co., the nation's biggest coal miner
            by market value, jumped 5.3 percent to HK$21.80 in Hong Kong
            after revenue rose last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Billabong International Ltd. (BBG), a global surfwear maker,
            surged 34 percent to 33.5 Australian cents in Sydney after its
            chief executive officer stepped down yesterday amid a
            refinancing deal. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Spain Earns 'Star Performer' Tag From SocGen as Bonds Beat Italy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Spain's bonds outperformed their
            Italian equivalents for a fourth-straight day as Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. raised its forecast for growth in the Iberian nation
            and Societe Generale SA said it's Europe's 'star performer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish 10-year (GSPG10YR) securities were set for their first weekly
            advance this month as SocGen analysts recommended buying the
            debt instead of German bunds. The increased optimism about
            Spain's economy, which shrank for nine consecutive quarters
            through June 2013, contrasts with its fortunes during the euro-area debt crisis, when concern that the
            currency bloc would
            splinter pushed borrowing costs above 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spain is 'the star performer in Europe, and probably will
            remain so for a while,' Marc-Henri Thoumin, a fixed-income
            strategist at SocGen in London, wrote in a client note dated
            yesterday. Spanish bonds 'should catch up further as sentiment
            improves,' he wrote, referring to the yield spread to bunds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish 10-year yields fell two basis points, or 0.02
            percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 4:24 p.m. London time, set
            for a decline of 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, this
            week. The price of the 3.8 percent security due in April 2024
            rose 0.16, or 1.60 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,351) face amount to
            110.12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Spanish economy will grow 1.2 percent this year and 1.6
            percent in 2015, Goldman Sachs economists led by London-based
            Huw Pill wrote in a the note dated yesterday. That compares with
            previous predictions of 0.9 percent and 1.2 percent,
            respectively. The Bank of Italy forecasts Italian gross domestic
            product will increase 0.2 percent in 2014 and 1.3 percent next
            year, it said in an economic bulletin today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spain's 10-year yield was 18 basis points below the rate on
            similar-maturity Italian debt. The spread widened two basis
            points today and has increased from less than 12 basis points at
            the end of last week. In 2012, the Spanish securities yielded as
            much as 116 basis points more than Italy's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Spain-Germany 10-year (GDBR10) spread narrowed two basis points
            to 146 basis points. Investors should target the spread
            narrowing to 120 basis points, Thoumin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, giving the Standard Poor's 500 Index a fourth straight week of gains, as
            better-than-forecast results from General Electric Co. (GE) offset disappointing earnings from Google Inc.
            and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GE surged 4.6 percent to the highest in almost five years,
            pacing gains among industrial shares. Pfizer Inc. advanced 2.1 percent to boost health-care stocks.
            Technology shares sank 2 percent. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, plunged 11 percent and
            Google, owner of the most popular Internet search engine, lost 1.6 percent. Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
            (AMD) retreated 13 percent after saying its gross margin would narrow in the current quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.2 percent to a record 1,692.09 at 4 p.m. in New York, erasing an earlier decline
            of as much as 0.3 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4.8 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to
            15,543.74. The Nasdaq 100 Index slid 1.1 percent to 3,044.93, the biggest drop in a month. About 5.9 billion

            have held up reasonably well,' said Henk Potts, who helps oversee $282 billion as an equity strategist at
            Barclays Plc's wealth unit in London. 'We've seen some winners and some losers coming through. There has

        <headline>Russia to Reduce Reliance on Microsoft, IBM After Sanctions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's parliament is preparing new rules in a bid to cut its reliance on foreign technology
            suppliers after U.S. sanctions against some of the country's largest companies, a move that could hurt sales
            at vendors such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, is drafting a bill to require government agencies and
            state-run enterprises to give preference to local providers of software and hardware, according to a
            document from the commission for strategic information systems obtained by Bloomberg News. The paper
            addresses criteria for tender processes such as favoring products that don't have imported, licensed
            components. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This all has to do with sanctions,' Andrey Chernogorov, executive secretary
            of the commission, said in a phone interview. 'Given the current international tensions, substituting
            imports with local software and hardware becomes the key to ensuring self sufficiency.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Obama administration on July 16 tightened sanctions on Russian banks, energy and defense companies to punish
            the country over its interference in Ukraine. On the following day, the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet
            caught in the military conflict, killing all 298 people on board, sent the Ukraine crisis into a new phase
            and raises the prospect of further sanctions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;H-P, Oracle &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard
            Co. (HP), IBM, Microsoft, Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Germany's SAP SE had combined
            revenue of 285 billion rubles ($8.1 billion) from Russia last year, according to estimates by the Russian
            Academy of Sciences that are included in the commission's document. Hewlett-Packard and IBM together
            accounted for almost 78 percent of the figure. About 77 percent of the total sales were contracts from the
            government and state-controlled companies, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for IBM and Oracle in the
            U.K. declined to comment on the planned law. Representatives for Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, SAP and Cisco
            didn't immediately return phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard
            slipped 0.5 percent at 9:48 a.m. in New York trading. IBM fell 1.2 percent, Microsoft lost 0.5 percent,
            Cisco dropped 0.1 percent and Oracle rose 0.3 percent. SAP lost 0.5 percent in Frankfurt trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission accelerated preparation for the bill after reports that American technology
            companies may cut off services to Russian banks and companies to comply with U.S. sanctions, Chernogorov
            said. The proposal may be submitted for a parliamentary vote in September, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rosneft,
            VEB &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among Russian companies the U.S. imposed lending curbs on last week are energy
            giants OAO Rosneft (ROSN) and OAO Novatek (NVTK) as well as Vnesheconombank and OAO Gazprombank. Since
            sanctions against Russia were first announced in March, President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called for
            substituting imports with domestic production to limit the threat to Russia's economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the lack of regulations in post-Soviet Russia that govern the award of technology contracts,
            foreign vendors account for 67 percent of software used in the country and about 90 percent of hardware,
            according to the commission. Foreign software may have hidden capabilities such as 'bugs' and 'backdoors,'
            giving suppliers access to confidential data, Chernogorov said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's Communications
            Ministry is among agencies seeking to cut dependence on foreign vendors as it develops its e-government
            initiative, a unified database of personal data used to provide online services such as granting a license
            permit or assigning a child to school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Local Production &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The idea
            of supporting local IT production is justified,' said Nikolay Komlev, executive director of the Russian
            Association of Computer and IT Enterprises, which represents multinationals such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard
            as well as Russian vendors. 'Still, its implementation proposed by State Duma may give a competitive
            advantage to not the most efficient companies.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's largest IT companies with
            annual revenue exceeding $1 billion include NCC, Lanit, Technoserv, NVision Group and IBS Group Holding Ltd.
            (IBSG), according to CNews Analytics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>London Bankers Race Traders at Sea to Push Boys' Cancer Jabs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;London financiers will swap suits for Lycra today as two teams race rowing boats from Barcelona to
            Ibiza in a campaign to include boys in vaccinations for a cancer-causing virus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bankers,
            commodities traders and one Olympic rower will brave searing heat and shipping lanes for three days in an
            effort to raise money and change public health policy on human papillomavirus. One aim of the 10-strong
            group is to lobby to change the U.K. vaccination program, which only treats girls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Men
            in 10 years' time are more likely to have HPV-related cancer than women,' said Tristan Almada, a hedge fund
            executive who founded the campaign and is president of the HPV and Anal Cancer Foundation. 'This is a
            gender-neutral virus that requires a gender-neutral vaccine.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For two of the men, HPV is
            personal. Almada's mother died of the virus-related anal cancer in 2010, and fellow rower Pierre Andurand's
            mother is undergoing treatment. Their mothers' names, Isabel and Danielle, have been given to the boats. HPV
            also causes cervical and penile cancer and may trigger 5 percent of all cancers, according to the NoMan is
            an Island campaign. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cause is attracting senior figures from the finance world.
            Andurand founded hedge fund Andurand Capital Management LLP. Other rowers include Pierre Lacaze, chief
            executive officer of LCM Commodities, and executives from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Urgent
            Issue &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;HPV-related cancer can be prevented through vaccination. Yet stigma surrounding
            sexually-transmitted disease and HPV's characterization as a woman's issue, because of its links to cervical
            cancer, have prevented universal inoculation, Almada said. He has petitioned the Centers for Disease Control
            and Prevention in the U.S. since 2010 and has reported to the Joint Committee on Vaccination and
            Immunization, a body of the U.K. department of health, though policy remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            200-mile Row to End HPV is designed to get people engaged with the issue, and 'convey the urgency that got
            the world behind polio and smallpox,' said Almada, whose day job is at derivatives hedge fund Taurosso
            Capital, which he co-founded. The event will also raise money for grants and to collaborate with the medical
            profession in research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rowers range in age from 28 to 41, and while they include
            veterans of Ironman competitions and mountain climbing, all but two are novices on water. Even Mark Hunter,
            who won a gold medal for the U.K. in Beijing, confesses to having little experience of rowing at sea. Teams
            of two will row in two-hour shifts and navigate themselves. A support boat will be on standby. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The teams had raised about $700,000 toward their $1 million target on Friday. The race will be an
            annual event, Almada said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a metallurgical-coal producer, cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent from
            12.5
            cents as a condition for amending a $2.73 billion credit pact. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move was among changes to covenants agreed with
            lenders, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said today in a
            filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter's net senior secured leverage will rise to more than
            5.5 times this quarter, the level needed to remain in compliance
            with the debt agreement, Benjamin Nelson, a New York-based
            analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said in a June 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter metallurgical coal output was about 2.9
            million metric tons, about 7 percent more than in the preceding
            period, Walter said in a separate statement. Cash production
            costs fell more than 10 percent in the same comparison, it said.
            The company didn't provide year-earlier numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Adding Goldman, Nike, Visa Hurts Dow Average: Chart of the Day</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average's reshuffling last year helps explain why the gauge has failed to
            keep pace with other U.S. stock benchmarks this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY compares the
            performance of three stocks that joined the Dow in September -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Nike Inc. and Visa
            Inc. -- with the shares they replaced. Each group is represented by a price-weighted index, the same method
            used to calculate the average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman, Nike and Visa all were lower for the year as of
            yesterday. Visa, based in San Francisco, had the highest weight among the Dow industrials' 30 stocks: 8.3
            percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based Goldman was third at 6.6 percent. Nike,
            based in Beaverton, Oregon, was 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only one of the stocks removed from the
            average, Bank of America Corp., had a year-to-date loss as of yesterday. Shares of the Charlotte, North
            Carolina-based company were 0.3 percent lower. Hewlett-Packard Co., based in Palo Alto, California, was 26
            percent higher. Alcoa Inc., based in New York, had a gain of 61 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HP's move was
            in line with rallies for Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp., technology companies that are
            still in the Dow. All three have relatively low stock prices, which limited their total weighting to 4
            percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirteen stocks in the Dow industrials ended yesterday's trading with
            2014 losses. The average was 3.2 percent higher, which trailed the Standard Poor's 500 Index's 7.3 percent
            advance and the Nasdaq Composite Index's 6.7 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Google Challenges Apple TV With $35 Video-Streaming Device</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), owner of the world's
            most popular search engine, introduced a device that sends
            YouTube and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) videos from phones, tablets and laptops
            to televisions, bolstering competition with Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chromecast, a small $35 dongle that plugs into a TV's HDMI
            input, lets customers watch and control online videos without
            their remote control. The gadget, unveiled at an event today in
            San Francisco, works with Android devices as well as Apple's
            iPhone, and enables users to continue using their phone for
            other activities while streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Of course people would want to watch YouTube and Netflix
            on the device with the biggest screen, but the user experience
            on the TV has been so difficult,' said Rishi Chandra, a
            director of product management at the Mountain View, California-based company, in an interview after the
            event. 'If you have to
            stop using your phone just to watch something on TV, it's not a
            viable solution.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The announcement of Chromecast came after Google introduced
            an updated Nexus 7 tablet, which has a sharper screen and is
            being made in partnership with Taiwan's Asustek Computer Inc. (2357) In
            tablets, devices running Android software have been gaining
            share versus Apple's iPad. The move into televisions follows
            previous unsuccessful efforts for Google, including a media-streaming device called Q that never shipped
            based on poor
            initial feedback, and the Google TV set-top box that has lagged
            the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai said in an
            interview that the company would continue pushing Google TV,
            which turns TV into an Android device capable of playing apps
            and other content, 'in a big way.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Content Partners &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chromecast, which looks like a USB stick, wirelessly syncs
            video being watched on a customer's mobile devices and TV.
            Pichai said the device will also work with Pandora Media Inc. (P)'s
            music-streaming service and other content partners in the
            future. It goes on sale today through Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Best Buy
            Co.'s website and the Google Play store. Google said that
            through a partnership with Netflix, Chromecast customers will
            get three free months of the streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple TV in its current iteration is a $99 set-top box,
            though Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said the company is
            considering other television products. Apple also has AirPlay,
            which lets consumers stream pictures and videos from iPhones and
            iPads to Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Tablet Shipments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The upgraded Nexus 7 is Google's latest effort to parlay
            its success in smartphones to larger devices. Tablet shipments,
            benefiting from consumer migration away from personal computers,
            are expected to grow 68 percent this year, outpacing a 4.3
            percent increase for mobile phones, according to research firm
            Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Tablets are going to be part of the next era,' said
            Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Gartner. 'It means eyeballs
            and it means accounts and it means knowing what the consumers
            are doing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google develops the Android operating system and offers it
            for free to makers of phones and tablets, as well as using the
            software in its own devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nexus 7 ranges in price from $229 for a Wi-Fi version
            to $349 for a device with more memory that also works over
            cellular networks. The new Nexus 7 is 50 grams lighter than its
            predecessor with the same screen size and a high resolution
            display, said Hugo Barra, vice president of Android product
            management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a much more comfortable grip and fits easily into
            your purse or jacket pocket,' Barra said. For the screen,
            'having a crisp and bright display makes all the difference,'
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Upbeat Reviews &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nexus, which sports a 7-inch screen, received positive
            reviews last year for its sleek design and intuitive software.
            The gadget offers the best value among its rivals, CNET said in
            a review last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With its excellent design, useful software features, and
            low starting price, the Nexus 7 is the cheapest way to
            experience the best that the Android' operating system has to
            offer, CNET said. 'The Nexus 7 is still the overall best small
            tablet.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nexus 7 goes up against Apple's iPad Mini, which is 7.9
            inches, and Amazon's Kindle Fire, which also has a 7-inch screen
            and uses a version of Android. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google also announced today that it's making textbook
            purchases and rentals available on the new tablet. Books from
            all five major publishers will be in Google's store in time for
            the coming school year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google fell 0.1 percent to $902.90 at the close in New
            York. The stock has gained 28 percent this year, compared with a
            17 percent drop in shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>For Packer, Jay-Z, Walton Heirs Show U.S. Unwinding</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;'You'd better cash in while you can'
            is the mantra that defines our times says George Packer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His new book, 'The Unwinding: An Inner History of the New
            America,' takes a close look at people trying to cope with
            accelerating change as institutions and traditions crumble
            around them, interspersed with portraits of the rich and famous. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We spoke at Bloomberg world headquarters in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lundborg: You point out that in 1997, lobbying was still
            called 'selling-out,' but by 2009 it was known as 'cashing in.'
            What changed? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Packer: Partly what I'm writing about is the way taboos get
            toppled. And once they do, everybody rushes through because
            you're a sucker if you don't. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before, a senator who had statesman-like aspiration didn't
            then become a lobbyist. One little data point that's stuck in my
            head is that Al Gore, who used to be the born-to-the-manner
            patrician-politician, made $100 million a few months ago, $70
            million by selling his TV network to Qatar. That's an
            inconvenient truth, if there ever was one. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lying Quants &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lundborg: You wrote: 'On Wall Street, to succeed you just
            had to be somewhat comfortable with math or else with bullshit.
            The former went into trading and the latter into sales. And a
            quant who could lie made the big money.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SAC, Goldman, JPMorgan, GMAC, Daimler, Exxon Mobil: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Insider trading evidence against SAC
            Capital Advisors LP includes court-authorized wiretaps, a U.S.
            prosecutor said at the $14 billion hedge fund's arraignment in
            federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The discovery will be voluminous, including a large
            number of electronic recordings, including electronic messages,
            instant messages, court-authorized wiretaps and consensual
            recordings,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told U.S.
            District Judge Laura Taylor Swain Friday about the pretrial
            evidence-gathering process. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors didn't specify whether the wiretaps were
            directed at SAC founder and owner Steven A. Cohen or any other
            SAC employee. Cohen wasn't in court Friday for the hearing that
            lasted about 15 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inside the crowded courtroom, the defense table was lined
            with six criminal lawyers for SAC. Peter Addison Nussbaum, SAC's
            general counsel, entered a not guilty plea on behalf of each of
            the four SAC business entities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. alleges that the four units are culpable for
            allowing insider trading to become institutionalized as a way of
            doing business at the Stamford, Connecticut-based hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nussbaum declined to comment after the hearing, as did
            Martin Klotz, another SAC lawyer from Willkie Farr Gallagher
            LLP. Also representing SAC is Theodore 'Ted' Wells from Paul
            Weiss Rifkind Wharton Garrison LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the criminal case, each of the SAC units charged
            faces a maximum of at least $25 million or twice the profits
            made or losses avoided on each of the alleged crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAC last week told investors, employees and counterparties
            that it will stay open for business as the U.S. presses its
            case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-00541, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre Says 'I Haven't Done Anything Wrong' at Testimony's End &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre made one final attempt to convince jurors in
            Manhattan that he didn't defraud investors in a 2007 mortgage
            bond-backed investment that lost them $1 billion when the U.S.
            housing market crashed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I haven't done anything wrong, as I'm here literally to
            tell the truth and to clear my name,' Tourre, 34, said Friday
            as he wrapped up his testimony in the trial of the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud case against
            him. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC claims Tourre, a former vice president at Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS), hid the involvement of the hedge fund Paulson
            Co. in selecting the mortgage bonds underlying the investment,
            known as Abacus 2007-AC1, and then made a $1 billion bet it
            would fail. The agency plans to rest its case against Tourre
            when the trial reconvenes July 29. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre testified he made $1.7 million in salary and bonus
            in 2007. If found liable for fraud, he faces money penalties and
            a possible ban from the securities industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre told jurors Friday that he learned in April 2010 the
            SEC was suing him and Goldman Sachs over Abacus from a news
            headline scrolling on his Bloomberg terminal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre, a French citizen, said he voluntarily testified
            before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 2010. After that he 'had
            to take a step back and think about what to do,' as his career
            had been 'effectively destroyed' by the allegations. Tourre
            was placed on paid leave by Goldman Sachs for one year, at his
            base salary of about $750,000. He said he hoped he'd be able to
            return to the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I was hoping I could make the SEC understand this
            transaction,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre told jurors he did volunteer work in East Africa and
            is now pursuing a doctorate in economics at the University of
            Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre's lead lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, sought to minimize
            Tourre's responsibility for the Abacus transaction by
            highlighting his relatively junior status and showing that the
            transaction was reviewed by dozens of people at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre was called as a witness by the SEC and was
            questioned by both sides. He isn't expected to testify again
            when his defense team presents its case this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;GMAC Will Pay Borrowers $230 Million on Faulty Foreclosures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage, part of the home lending unit owned by Ally
            Financial Inc. (ALLY), will pay $230 million to compensate borrowers
            for improper handling of foreclosures, the Federal Reserve said
            July 26 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GMAC Mortgage will pay about 232,000 borrowers to settle
            claims it improperly seized homes, the Fed said. In a deal
            similar to those regulators struck with 13 other mortgage
            servicers this year, the money goes to borrowers who faced
            foreclosure in 2009 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Settlements reached since January with 14 of the largest
            U.S. mortgage servicers, total more than $3.8 billion and will
            close the books on mishandled foreclosures after the 2008 credit
            crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're relieved to be able to distribute these funds
            directly to borrowers rather than spend the time and money with
            consultants to complete the file review,' Tammy Hamzehpour, a
            spokeswoman for Residential Capital -- part of the Ally mortgage
            unit placed into bankruptcy last year -- said in an e-mailed
            statement. 'That process would not have returned anywhere near
            as much money, to as many potentially harmed borrowers, as will
            this settlement.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company settled without admitting or denying
            wrongdoing. The payments will come from the Residential Capital
            estate, Hamzehpour said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;France Blocks Mercedes Compact Registrations in Coolant Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daimler AG (DAI), the world's third-biggest maker of luxury
            vehicles, is barred from registering its Mercedes-Benz compact
            models in France because regulators have stopped accepting a
            coolant fluid used in the vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mercedes A- and B-Class as well as the CLA coupe can't
            be registered in the country as they use a refrigerant that no
            longer meets to European Union environmental regulations, the
            Ministry of Ecology, Development and Energy said in a statement
            July 26. Daimler said Friday that it plans legal action against
            the move, which it called a misreading of EU law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daimler has been in talks for about a year with European
            authorities over a newer refrigerant, R1234yf, that regulators
            say meets stricter standards on greenhouse gas emissions. The
            Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer has held off from
            switching to R1234yf, saying the new fluid is susceptible to
            catching fire in car crashes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daimler sold 15,745 compact vehicles in France in the first
            six months of 2013, accounting for about 2 percent of its global
            car deliveries in the period, Ulrike Bless, a spokeswoman, said
            by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The carmaker was in 'discussions with all the relevant
            institutions in order to reach rapid clarification of the
            situation,' Daimler said in its second-quarter report published
            July 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banks Should Shed Commodities and Focus on Banking, Chilton Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks that own, trade or warehouse commodities should
            consider going back to being banks, U.S. Commodity Futures
            Trading Commission member Bart Chilton said July 26 after
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) announced it was considering selling its
            physical commodities business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This whole area of banks owning the physical, warehousing
            and delivery mechanisms of commodities is one that policy makers
            need to thoughtfully consider, and soon,' Chilton said in an e-mail. 'Banks getting back to being banks and
            making loans to
            businesses and individuals seems like the best course of action.
            Perhaps that will happen without any policy changes, although I
            have definite doubts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said it may sell or spin off its physical
            commodities business three days after a congressional hearing
            examined whether banks are using their ownership of raw
            materials to manipulate markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm plans to continue running the commodities unit
            'as a going concern and fully support ongoing client
            activities' while it considers its options, JPMorgan said. One
            possibility is a strategic partnership, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators including the Federal Reserve are under pressure
            to explain why they allow banks to run trading operations while
            also owning mines, oil fields, railroads and warehouses. A
            reversal of those regulatory policies could put commodity units
            of JPMorgan as well as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, the Ohio Democrat whose
            subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee held hearings on
            the industry this week, has called on the Fed to give clear
            guidance on what non-bank activities should be allowed 'and
            consider placing limitations on those that expose banks and
            taxpayers to undue risk.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;In the Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Exxon Mobil's $105 Million MTBE Defeat Upheld by U.S. Court &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A U.S. jury's $104.7 million damage award against Exxon
            Mobil Corp. (XOM) for contaminating New York City wells with the
            gasoline additive MTBE was upheld by a federal appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The award for compensatory damages to clean up contaminated
            wells was proper, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan said in
            a ruling July 26, denying Exxon Mobil's challenge to the 2009
            verdict. The Irving, Texas-based company said it plans to appeal
            the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We reject Exxon's argument that the jury's verdict
            conflicts with and is therefore pre-empted by the Clean Air Act
            Amendments of 1990,' the appeals panel said, adding that the
            jury properly offset the award by amounts attributed to cleanup
            of other contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York sued Exxon Mobil and other oil companies in 2003,
            alleging that they knew the gasoline additive methyl tertiary
            butyl ether, or MTBE, would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil
            argued that state laws are pre-empted by the Clean Air Act,
            which required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce
            air pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE
            to make it burn more thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'MTBE has not been used for seven years, cleanup
            successfully continues and the myriad of data shows MTBE
            detections decreasing,' Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon
            Mobil, said in an e-mail. The company 'will be filing an appeal
            to the United States Supreme Court,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This case is one of scores around the country by
            municipalities, states and individuals against oil refiners,
            distributors and retailers over MTBE. Many, including New York
            City's, were consolidated in New York federal court for
            evidence-gathering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A state appeals court in Maryland in February reversed two
            jury awards totaling $1.65 billion against Exxon Mobil over MTBE
            contamination, ruling that the company hadn't made fraudulent
            statements and the property owners who sued hadn't demonstrated
            physical harm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A jury in New Hampshire state court in April ordered Exxon
            Mobil to pay $236 million in damages for contaminating
            groundwater with MTBE. The company has appealed that verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeal is In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Products
            Liability Litigation, 10-4329, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
            Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Texas Loses Bid to Stop EPA Takeover of Greenhouse Gas Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Texas's bid to keep control of its own greenhouse gas
            permitting program was rejected by a divided federal appeals
            court in a decision that supports a takeover by the U.S.
            Environmental Protection Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
            said July 26 that Texas, Wyoming, Peabody Energy Corp. and
            industry groups aren't in a legal position to challenge federal
            rules governing the revision of state implementation plans,
            known as SIPs. The ruling follows the court's holding last year
            that the EPA's limits on greenhouse gas emissions are lawful. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parties cannot show harm because 'the permitting
            requirements are self-executing' under the Clean Air Act, U.S.
            Circuit Judge Judith Rogers wrote in a majority opinion joined
            by Judge David Tatel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Texas sued the agency in 2010 to prevent the EPA from
            taking control of the state's regulation of carbon-emissions
            from stationary sources. States were required to regulate
            greenhouse gases as pollutants in their permitting programs by
            January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bryan Shaw, chairman of the Texas Commission on
            Environmental Quality, said in an emailed statement that the
            'EPA has effectively rewritten the Clean Air Act to impose its
            new standards, imposed severely restrictive timelines on the
            states to implement its new requirements, and then twisted the
            act to immediately impose its agenda on Texas.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a dissent, Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh argued that
            under EPA regulations the states should have three years to
            revise their plans before any federal intervention. He said the
            regulation also doesn't impose a construction moratorium during
            those three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is State of Texas v. Environmental Protection
            Agency, 10-1425, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
            Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MF Global Reaches Settlement With JPMorgan Unit on Recovery &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd. reached a settlement giving it a
            share of JPMorgan Chase Co.'s recovery on a $60 million claim
            against the holding company's brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under a prior settlement with the brokerage, MF Global
            Inc., JPMorgan agreed to hand over $100 million in customer
            property and in return received the $60 million unsecured claim.
            As part of a new settlement, JPMorgan will give a percentage of
            its recovery on the claim to the holding company, according to
            court papers filed July 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigations of the bank 'concluded that, while there
            are potential claims against JPMorgan, it is not at all clear'
            that plaintiffs would prevail in litigation seeking to recover
            money on the claims, lawyers for MF Global Holdings wrote in the
            filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's settlements with the brokerage have so far
            resulted in a total of $1 billion being made available to
            distribute to former customers, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The holding company's Chapter 11 case is In re MF Global
            Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). The broker liquidation is In
            re MF Global Inc., 11-bk-02790, same court. The class-action
            case is 11-cv-7866, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
            New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Glencore Leading in Metals Storage as Goldman, JPMorgan Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Glencore Xstrata Plc, the biggest
            publicly traded raw-materials supplier, became the largest owner
            of warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange as banks
            pull back amid increased scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pacorini Metals, owned by Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore,
            added 14 warehouses this year, taking its total to 178, or two
            more than C. Steinweg Handelsveem BV, according to LME data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The expansion contrasts with a drop in
            listed warehouses held by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), the third and fourth-largest owners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. financial regulators told a Senate hearing yesterday
            they will boost scrutiny of banks' commodities holdings and the
            Federal Reserve said this month it will review a decade-old
            decision to let them trade raw materials. The LME, which handles
            about 80 percent of trading in industrial metals futures, is
            reviewing storage rules that buyers say helped accumulate
            inventory in fewer sites, distorting supply and raising prices
            for consumers even as global production outpaces demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would hope regulators would take a holistic approach as
            they consider LME warehouses, not solely those owned by banks,'
            Nick Madden, a senior vice president and supply-chain officer at
            Novelis Inc., an Atlanta-based aluminum parts maker whose
            customers include The Coca-Cola Co. and Ford Motor Co., wrote in
            an e-mail. 'Our major concern is over the ownership of
            warehouses by banks and trading companies. It creates an
            imbalance in the marketplace.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Norton Rose, Goodwin Procter, Milbank: Business of Law</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, the
            transatlantic combination of London-based law firm Norton Rose
            LLP and U.S. law firm Fulbright Jaworski LLP was completed
            yesterday as the firm announced its leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The merger creates a 3,800-lawyer firm with more than 50
            offices in Europe, the Americas, Asia, Australia, Africa and the
            Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter Martyr will continue to lead the global executive
            management team'and is joined by Fulbright's former managing
            partner Kenneth Stewart. The firm's global chairman is Adrian Ahern, based in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Norton Rose Fulbright has a strong business model and
            culture. We also have momentum,' Martyr said in a statement.
            'This combination endorses our position on the global stage.
            This is one of the largest transatlantic legal combinations
            completed to date and confirms Norton Rose Fulbright as a global
            legal practice. We have an exciting future ahead.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the firm has more than 750 lawyers at 11 U.S.
            offices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The combined firm, which operates under a Swiss verein, a
            corporate structure that allows the firms to keep separate
            profit pools, will rank among the top 10 wealthiest law firms
            with its combined gross revenues. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Norton Rose has lawyers across a range of practices. The
            firm said in a statement its key industry sector strengths are
            financial institutions; energy; infrastructure, mining and
            commodities; technology and innovation; transport; and life
            sciences and health care. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mid-America to Buy Colonial Properties in $2.2 Billion Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP was legal adviser to Mid-America
            Apartment Communities Inc. (MAA), a Memphis-based residential
            landlord, which agreed to buy Colonial Properties Trust (CLP) for
            about $2.2 billion in stock to expand as demand climbs for U.S.
            apartment rentals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell Berkowitz PC also
            advised Mid-America. Burr Forman LLP and Hogan Lovells LLP
            advised Colonial Properties. Burr Forman partners Mike
            Atchison and Ed Hardin, who are outside co-general counsel for
            Colonial, worked on the deal. Burr partners Jack Stephenson and
            April Mason also worked on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colonial investors will receive 0.36 newly issued Mid-America shares for each share of Colonial
            they own, the
            companies said in a statement yesterday. Based on Mid-America's
            closing share price of $67.97 on May 31, that indicates a price
            of $24.47, about 11 percent more than Birmingham, Alabama-based
            Colonial's last close. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter's deal team was led by Gil Menna, and
            included partners Yoel Krantz, Mark Opper, Craig Todaro and Neal Sandford on tax. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baker Donelson's partners include Robert J. DelPriore and
            Richard F. Mattern, corporate, and William H.D. Fones Jr., tax. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hogan Lovells team consisted of Washington corporate
            partners Paul Manca, Warren Gorrell, Joe Gilligan, and
            Washington tax partner Cristina Arumi. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Latham Watkins LLP is advising JPMorgan in the
            transaction with a corporate team led by Orange County partner
            Charles Ruck, and Los Angeles partner Julian Kleindorfer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal would create a real estate investment trust with
            about 85,000 rental units, primarily focused on the U.S. south.
            Demand for rental homes is rising among Americans who can't
            qualify for a mortgage or don't want to own property after the
            worst housing crash since the Great Depression. The nation's
            apartment-vacancy rate was 4.3 percent in the first quarter, the
            lowest in more than a decade, according to Reis Inc. (REIS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The scale of the combined company will support
            accelerated growth,' Mid-America Chief Executive Officer H. Eric Bolton Jr. said in the statement. The
            merger will 'drive
            higher margins as a result of synergies and advantages
            generated.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mid-America shareholders will own about 56 percent of the
            combined company's equity with Colonial owners holding the rest.
            Bolton will be chairman and CEO, while Mid-America's chief
            financial officer and chief operating officer will also assume
            those roles at the combined company. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;International Project Finance Partner to Join Milbank in Tokyo &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Milbank, Tweed, Hadley McCloy LLP'announced that project
            finance lawyer'Aled Davies, previously the head of Allen Overy
            LLP's Asia Pacific projects group, will join the firm in Tokyo
            in September. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Davies, who will be a member of Milbank's global project
            finance group, recently advised on the Ichthys LNG project, a
            liquefied natural gas facility being developed in Western
            Australia and the Northern Territory, Australia, the firm said.
            The $34 billion Ichthys LNG project is the largest project
            financing ever, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to his project work, Davies often advises
            clients on asset-based financings, including tax-based leasing
            of large drillships and other vessels used in energy
            exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are fortunate to gain the talents of Aled Davies, who
            has led high-profile financings in every corner of the globe,
            with an emphasis on high-impact energy and natural resource
            development,' Milbank chairman'Scott Edelman said in a
            statement.''His arrival also underscores our commitment to
            Japan, where we recently marked our 35th anniversary as the
            first international law firm in Tokyo.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Milbank's project finance practice teams has more than 100
            lawyers, who closed on more than 140 project financings, raising
            more than $125 billion in the last three years, the firm said.
            Milbank is headquartered in New York and has 600 lawyers at 11
            offices in the Americas, Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Herbert Smith Global Funds Partner Joins Bingham &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bingham McCutchen LLP is expanding its global funds
            practice with the addition of Herbert Smith Freehills LLP's
            Thiha Tun as a partner in the London office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tun, who joins the firm in September, represents investment
            funds, investment managers and others in the funds industry. He
            works with private equity, real estate, infrastructure and hedge
            funds, the firm said. He will work closely with partner John
            Holton, who relocated his international funds practice to the
            London office from Boston in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Thiha has built a strong practice that will augment our
            growing international funds and financial regulatory
            capabilities,' Bingham investment management practice group
            leader Roger Joseph said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bingham has about 1,000 lawyers in 14 offices in the U.S.
            Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Akin Gump Adds Corporate Partner Chen in Beijing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP added to its corporate
            practice in Asia with the hire of Chen Li as a partner in the

            &lt;p&gt;'Outbound MA is emerging as a key driver of growth and
            consolidation for Chinese companies,' Greg Puff, head of Akin
            Gump's Asia practice said in a statement. 'Li has proven skills
            helping Chinese companies navigate these transactions and a
            track record as a well-respected lawyer with a profound

            &lt;h2&gt;Apple Fights U.S. E-Books Pricing Claims in Antitrust Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), accused by the U.S. of being the ringleader in
            a conspiracy with publishers to fix prices of electronic books,
            went to trial in a case that will feature evidence from the
            company's dead founder, Steve Jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department began his opening
            statement in Manhattan federal court yesterday in a rare
            antitrust trial to determine whether Apple orchestrated an
            illegal price-fixing agreement when it entered the e-books
            market in 2010 with the introduction of the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple and five of the six biggest U.S. publishers
            'consciously committed to a scheme to raise e-book prices
            throughout the industry' that cost consumers hundreds of
            millions of dollars, Justice Department lawyer Lawrence Buterman
            told U.S. District Judge Denise Cote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple claims it did nothing wrong and says it benefited
            consumers by bringing innovation and competition to an e-books
            market that was dominated by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Apple's lawyer,
            Orin Snyder, a partner at Gibson Dunn Crutcher LLP, yesterday
            echoed Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook in his opening
            statement yesterday, calling the government's case 'bizarre.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Apple is going to trial because it did nothing wrong,'
            Snyder said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple is the last defendant remaining in the case after the
            five publishers sued by the government avoided trial by
            settling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You don't see a lot of these antitrust trials,' said
            Andrew M. Friedman, a partner with the law firm Patton Boggs LLP
            in Washington. 'It's pretty unusual.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is part of an upsurge in antitrust litigation by
            the Justice Department, reflecting an Obama administration that
            has been more aggressive than its predecessors in challenging
            companies. The government is seeking an order barring Apple from
            anticompetitive actions, including price-fixing, in the market
            for digital books. The U.S. isn't asking for money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A group of states is also seeking fines and unspecified
            damages. If Apple is found liable in the trial, damages will be
            determined in a separate proceeding. A win for the government
            may fuel class actions by private plaintiffs seeking triple
            damages permitted under antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government team is led by Mark W. Ryan, the director of
            litigation for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. Ryan
            joined the division after a career in private practice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ryan supervised a lawsuit that challenged beermaker
            Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)'s proposed $20.1 billion purchase of
            Grupo Modelo SAB. The suit was settled in April. Ryan is joined
            by Buterman, who represented the government in a 2011 case that
            killed HR Block Inc. (HRB)'s proposed $287.5 million acquisition of
            the maker of TaxAct products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gabriel Gervey, a lawyer in the Texas attorney general's
            office, is the lead lawyer for the states. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Apple Inc., 12-cv-02826, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Robert E. Rice Named as Chief Counsel to SEC Chairwoman White &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robert E. Rice was appointed Securities and Exchange
            Commission Chief Counsel, Mary Jo White said yesterday in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rice is a former federal prosecutor and most recently, the
            head of governance, litigation and regulation for the Americas
            at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. He was also the global co-head
            of its governance, litigation and regulation operating
            committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the SEC, Rice will be a senior legal and policy adviser
            to White and provide advice and counsel on regulatory matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rice, 57, began his legal career in 1987 as an associate at
            Simpson, Thacher Bartlett LLP, in New York, and spent from
            1991 to 2000 in the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's
            Office in the Southern District of New York. He investigated and
            prosecuted securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and money
            laundering cases and was named Deputy Chief of the Criminal
            Division, according to the SEC statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before joining Deutsche Bank in 2004, he spent four years
            at McDermott, Will Emery LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Singapore Ex-Law Professor Jailed Five Months for Corruption &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tey Tsun Hang, a former associate professor of law at
            National University of Singapore, was sentenced to five months
            in prison for abusing his position by having sex with a student
            and accepting gifts from her. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Corruption must be stamped out effectively and swiftly,'
            Chief District Judge Tan Siong Thye said in imposing the
            sentence at a Singapore subordinate court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tan imposed a longer term than had been sought by
            prosecutors, who had recommended that Tey, 42, be jailed for at
            least 12 weeks for violating the 'sacred' position of a
            teacher and undermining the university's reputation. Tey's
            lawyer Peter Low had sought only a fine for his client, or if
            necessary, he said, a short jail term. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tan raised Tey's bail to S$150,000 ($119,000) from
            S$100,000. Tey was handcuffed and led away by four police
            officers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Low said his client will be released once the bail is
            processed and will appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tey was sentenced to three months in jail for having sex
            with the student and two months for accepting the gifts, to be
            served consecutively. He was given the same terms for a second
            sex charge and three other charges of accepting gifts, which are
            to run concurrently. Each charge carried a maximum sentence of
            five years in jail and a S$100,000 fine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tey, fired by the university after his conviction, had said
            the gifts and sex were part of a consensual relationship he had
            in 2010 with the student, now 23. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Prosecutor v. Tey Tsun Hang. DAC027011/2012.

        <headline>Greg Penner Emerges as Heir to Wal-Mart's Chairmanship</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Greg Penner, the grandson-in-law of
            Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) founder Sam Walton, became heir apparent to
            the chairman role today after spending almost a decade investing
            the family's money as head of a venture firm in Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Penner, a 44-year-old who participates in triathlons,
            brings California sensibilities to the Arkansas-based retail
            chain, which named him vice chairman at its annual meeting
            today. Penner received his MBA from Stanford University in 1997
            before taking a series of Wal-Mart management jobs. In 2005, he
            started Madrone Capital Partners, a firm backed by money from
            Wal-Mart Chairman Rob Walton and other family members. Penner
            then joined Wal-Mart's board in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By elevating him to the newly created vice chairman
            position, the Waltons are betting that Penner's technology
            experience can help guide the company into a new era of e-commerce and smaller-format stores. The move also
            could raise
            hackles among Wal-Mart's critics, who say the Waltons already
            have too much control over the company. Wal-Mart described the
            change as an act of succession planning and said Penner will
            begin standing in as chairman when Rob Walton isn't present. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am committed to the long-term success of Wal-Mart,'
            Penner said in a statement today. 'I look forward to
            contributing to a stronger Wal-Mart in any way possible,
            including how we develop new digital capabilities to add to our
            store offering.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset-management unit hired Prashant Sharma as head of international
            fixed-income investments for insurance clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sharma will be based in London and report to Nick Gartside,
            international chief investment officer of fixed-income, New
            York-based JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. Sharma
            previously worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s asset-management
            business and has a decade of experience working as a fixed-income portfolio manager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asset managers including Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Inc.
            have been expanding their offerings and adding staff to win
            mandates from insurance companies as low interest rates pressure

            billion for the industry, recently made additions in Hong Kong

            investment needs as a client group are unique, and as our

        <headline>Corn Futures Decline as Demand Eases, U.S. Crop Rebounds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Corn fell, capping the biggest
            weekly slump since April, on signs of easing global demand as
            farmers complete planting of a projected record crop in the
            U.S., the world's top exporter. Wheat and soybeans declined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Export sales of corn in the week ended June 6 slid to
            149,460 metric tons, the lowest since January, the U.S.
            Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Farmers may harvest
            14.005 billion bushels, 30 percent more than a year earlier,
            boosting global production by 12 percent to a record, the agency
            said on June 12. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price forecast
            yesterday, citing the U.S. recovery from last year's drought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Global supplies are on the rise, and that has reduced
            demand for U.S. corn,' Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness
            for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a
            telephone interview. 'The weather forecasts for warm
            temperatures and regular rains should improve U.S. crop
            potential. We are shifting to a more plentiful supply outlook.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn futures for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent to
            close at $5.33 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
            Trade. This week, the price dropped 4.6 percent, the most since
            the five days ended April 5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its price forecasts for corn to $4.75 and $11 a
            bushel for soybeans in three, six and 12 months. The previous
            estimates for the latter two periods were $5.25 for the grain
            and $12.50 for the oilseed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soybean futures for delivery in November slipped 0.2
            percent to $12.9825. This week, the price dropped 2.4 percent.
            The U.S. harvest will surge 12 percent this year to a record
            3.39 billion bushels, according to the USDA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn and soybeans for July delivery rose as farmers
            withheld remaining supplies from last year's harvest that was
            reduced by drought, Grow said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For July, corn advanced 1.8 percent to $6.55 and soybeans
            gained 0.4 percent to $15.165. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wheat futures for July delivery declined 0.7 percent to
            $6.8075 a bushel. This week, the price dropped 2.2 percent as
            harvesting advances across the U.S., the largest exporter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Walter Cancels Plan to Refinance $1.55 Billion of Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Corp. (WLT), a U.S. miner of
            coal used in steelmaking, canceled a plan to refinance $1.55
            billion of loans as yields on bonds from the riskiest to the
            most creditworthy borrowers in the U.S. reached a 10-month high. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter had explored options including a new secured term
            loan facility, a new revolving credit facility and unsecured
            debt financing, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in a
            statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said it has no material debt principal payments
            due until 2015 and doesn't need incremental funding right now.
            The shares earlier dropped as much as 20 percent to $11.76 in
            New York, the biggest intraday decline since August 2011, before
            being halted after Forbes reported the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter joins Odebrecht SA, the Brazilian construction and
            engineering firm, and U.S. candle producer Yankee Candle Co. in
            terminating or delaying bond sales this week because of market
            conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on bonds from the riskiest to the most creditworthy
            borrowers in the U.S. reached 3.91 percent yesterday, the
            highest since August, and up from a record-low 3.35 percent on
            May 2, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
            Corporate High Yield index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal prices have dropped as miners haven't
            cut output quickly enough to match falling demand. Prices no
            longer cover cash production costs, even for mining companies
            considered to be low-cost producers, Mitesh Thakkar, an analyst
            at FBR Co. (FBRC) In Arlington, Virginia, wrote in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Challenging' Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While met markets have been challenging for marginal
            assets, we now believe that spot met prices have fallen to a
            level where they no longer cover full cash costs (including
            attributable corporate expenses) even for some of the low-cost
            producers,' Thakkar said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter investors rejected five nominees to its board
            proposed by activist shareholder Audley Capital Advisors LLP on
            April 25. Audley had called on the mining company to reduce debt
            and corporate expenses to boost profit. It was the second
            attempt by London-based Audley's co-founder and Managing Partner
            Julian Treger to compel change at Walter, which has posted two
            consecutive quarterly losses and seen its shares drop 65 percent
            this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Bullish as Goldman Cools Amid Debt Sales: Korea Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd. and
            PineBridge Investments said South Korean global corporate debt
            is still attractive, even as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            recommended shunning yield premiums near a seven-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Borrowers have sold $20.5 billion of international bonds
            this year, shy of the record $21 billion in the first half of
            2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Korea Gas Corp.,
            Kookmin Bank and Korea National Oil Corp. are holding investor
            meetings this week for possible dollar- or euro-denominated note
            offerings, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea's sovereign default risk fell to a lowest since
            2008 this month and the won reached the strongest in almost six
            years as investors show confidence in Asia's fourth-largest
            economy, which the central bank forecasts will grow at its
            fastest pace in five years in 2015. A global hunt for yield has
            driven 'profound' outperformance of Korea credit, making other
            Asian bonds seem better value, Goldman Sachs wrote in a report
            this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are active participants in Korean paper,' Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income in Hong
            Kong at JPMorgan Asset
            said on June 12. 'Korean credit spread levels are still
            attractive versus U.S. investment grade,' he said, adding that
            decisions on whether to buy new issues depend on valuations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korean investment-grade notes yield 2.13 percent on
            average, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
            That compares with 1.49 percent for corporate bonds from
            developed markets, a Merrill Lynch and Pacific Investment
            Management Co. measure shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average premium for dollar bonds sold by Korean issuers
            over U.S. Treasuries has contracted 37 basis points this year to
            124 on June 17. It touched 121 on April 25, the least since July
            2007, JPMorgan Chase Co. indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The outperformance of Korea has been profound,' Goldman
            Sachs analysts led by Kenneth Ho wrote in a June 12 report. 'We
            retain our negative view, because we see better value elsewhere
            in Asia investment grade, even though we believe that search for
            yield motives will likely keep Korea spreads tight,' Ho said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have been seeking extra yield after rates sunk
            globally as the world's major central banks held key lending
            rates near zero and enacted unprecedented monetary easing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Quality &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While credit spreads of Korean bonds may look tight, the
            volatility of them is also very low,' Arthur Lau, head of Asia
            ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge in Kong Kong, which oversees
            about $71 billion, said in June 13 interview. 'The high credit
            quality nature of Korean bonds also appeals to many long-term
            investors who are looking for stable and predictable returns.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 90-day historical volatility of Korean sovereign dollar
            debt maturing in April 2019 has fallen to 2.82 percent from as
            high as 14.46 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global investors are seeking higher yields in longer-maturity bonds. The extra yield investors
            demand to hold 10-year
            U.S. Treasuries over five-year securities contracted 38 basis
            points to 91 this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Now seems like a good time to sell long-dated dollar
            bonds,' Lee Sang Wook, a spokesperson for Korea Gas based in
            Seongnam near Seoul, said by phone on June 17. 'We are
            considering sales for refinancing maturing debt and possible
            overseas use.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Korea Oil, Kookmin &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Korea National Oil is mulling offshore issuance to
            refinance debt, Choi Hong Seok, a spokesperson for the Anyang,
            South Korea-based company, said by phone on yesterday. Kookmin
            Bank declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won touched 1,015.25 per dollar, the strongest level
            since August 2008, on June 10. Its 2.67 percent advance this
            year is the second biggest among emerging-market currencies.
            Ten-year won-denominated government bond yields have fallen 21
            basis points since March 31 to 3.305 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps insuring South Korea's sovereign debt
            against non-payment for five years fell to 49.5 basis points on
            June 6, the lowest close since January 2008, according to data
            provider CMA. That compared with 68.5 basis points for China,
            whose sovereign debt is rated Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service,
            the same as South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign-currency corporate bond sales rose 52 percent this
            year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Demand has been driven by
            onshore and offshore investors and a drop in net issuance,
            Goldman Sachs said. Borrowers face more than $47 billion of
            maturing offshore bonds this year, almost double the $26.7
            billion in 2013, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in the north-east Asian country increased
            holdings of Korean paper to $20.5 billion as of end-March,
            compared with $11.95 billion at the end of 2010, according to a
            May statement from the Bank of Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Supply of Korean bonds is expected to be limited this
            year,' PineBridge's Lau said. 'There may be room for spreads
            to tighten further.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Abe's Woman Manager Target Difficult to Meet'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects headline, lead to show target will be difficult to achieve; Adds comments from Sago in
            fourth paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Japan Co. said Prime
            Minister Shinzo Abe's goal to have women in 30 percent of management jobs by 2020 will be difficult to
            achieve, citing a lack of candidates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We now recruit exactly the same numbers of men
            and women,' Shigeharu Suzuki, chairman of Daiwa Securities Group, said yesterday in a diversity forum held
            at Bloomberg's Tokyo offices. 'That was not the case in the past and unfortunately we are not going to reach
            the target because we don't have enough people in the pipeline. Even if we promoted at an even rate, we
            would be around 15 percent or maybe a touch above by 2020.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Katsunori Sago, deputy
            president of Goldman Sachs Japan who is also co-chairman of the bank's diversity committee in Asia, said his
            firm faced similar difficulties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I agree completely with Mr. Suzuki. It's a difficult
            proposition,' Sago said at the same event. 'In an industry where women have been active for a while, 30
            percent is a target that is possible to reach. On the other hand, in the financial industry and in
            manufacturing, the proportion of women is low. It is difficult.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Labor Challenges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The comments reflect the challenges for Abe in drawing more women into jobs to maintain a labor
            force that is forecast to shrink as much as 42 percent by 2060 as the population ages. Japan's workforce
            would swell by more than seven million people and output would jump if participation by women equaled that
            of men, Goldman Sachs said in its latest 'Womenomics' report on May 6. Gender Equality Minister Masako Mori
            has said the bureaucracy will only reach Abe's target by recruiting people from outside. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If
            people say they can't do it, then we will never reach it,' Mori said at the same event in response to the
            comments by Suzuki and Sago. 'There are all sorts of excuses about why it can't be done, but I want you to
            keep on trying.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daiwa has introduced support measures for working mothers over the past
            decade, include extending childcare leave and shorter worker hours for those with children until the third
            year of elementary school. That has boosted its proportion of female managers to 7.2 percent this year from
            2.3 percent a decade ago, Suzuki said, citing documents prepared by Daiwa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Science
            Graduates &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The target could be harder to reach for companies in other fields, he said.
            'If you look at manufacturers, they need science graduates. There are very few women science graduates, so
            the pool of candidates is not there.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mori detailed the government's efforts to promote
            women in her presentation, including a push to offer 400,000 more childcare spots by 2018. In a draft growth
            strategy released on June 16, the government said it would consider a new law detailing strategies for
            reaching the 30 percent target in national and local government and private business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs's Sago said setting ambitious targets for female participation in the workforce was effective in
            itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I don't think we should quibble about the actual figure,' said Goldman Sachs's
            Sago, who is leaving his post this month and will serve as an advisory director. 'If you deliberately
            promote people early or promote unsuitable people in an attempt to look good, it can have a negative effect
            on diversity in the long term.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Disney Drops Most Since 2012 After Goldman Downgrade: L.A. Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world's biggest
            entertainment company, dropped the most since November 2012
            after Goldman Sachs Co. downgraded the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disney slid 3.7 percent to $61.98 at the New York close.
            The stock fell the most among the 30 companies in the Dow Jones
            Industrial Average (INDU), which declined 2.3 percent after the Federal
            Reserve said it may cut back its bond purchases. The shares
            have gained 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disney's ESPN faces rising costs for sports broadcast
            rights and new competition from News Corp. (NWSA)'s Fox Sports 1, which
            begins airing in August, Drew Borst, an analyst at Goldman
            Sachs (GS), wrote in a report published today. He lowered Disney's
            rating to neutral and removed the Burbank, California-based
            company from the firm's 'conviction buy' list. Borst didn't
            change his 12-month price target of $70. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ESPN, which provides about 45 percent of Disney's operating
            income, will be less profitable next year due to the higher cost
            of airing NFL football, Major League Baseball and college
            sports, Borst wrote. Fox Sports 1 will drive up prices by
            competing for TV rights. ESPN's NBA basketball contract expires
            after the 2015-2016 season and its Nascar rights expire next
            year, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disney's cable channels, including ESPN and ABC Family,
            produced $5.7 billion in operating income on revenue of $13.6
            billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 29. In that same
            period, Disney reported total operating profit of $9.96 billion
            on $42.3 billion in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Exxon, Chevron Sued by Pennsylvania Over Gas Additive</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
            were among oil companies accused by Pennsylvania of polluting
            groundwater with a gasoline additive in lawsuits similar to ones
            brought by New York City, New Hampshire and Vermont. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela's
            state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA, also were named in two
            complaints made public today in state court that seek damages
            for costs to clean up groundwater tainted by Methyl Tertiary
            Butyl Ether, or MTBE. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane and Governor Tom Corbett's office of
            general counsel filed
            the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'MTBE-related spills over the past 20 years have cost
            Pennsylvania hundreds of millions of dollars,' James Schultz,
            the governor's general counsel, said yesterday in a statement.
            'We cannot take the health of Pennsylvania's waters for granted
            and their protection must remain our utmost priority.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania lawsuits follow scores of claims filed by
            cities, states and individuals around the U.S. against oil
            refiners, retailers and distributors over MTBE. Exxon Mobil,
            Chevron and BP were among two dozen U.S. refiners sued this
            month by Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court in April upheld a jury's $104.7
            million damage award against Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil for
            contaminating New York City wells with the additive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Clean Air &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The city sued oil companies in 2003, alleging they knew the
            additive would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil argued that
            state laws were pre-empted by the federal Clean Air Act, which
            required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce air
            pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE to
            make the fuel burn more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reasonable alternatives to MTBE were available at the time
            oil companies jointly promoted gasoline with the additive,
            Pennsylvania claims in its lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Braden Reddall, a spokesman for San Ramon, California-based
            Chevron, said the company hadn't yet seen the suit and couldn't
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BP acted at all times in good faith,' said Scott Dean, a
            spokesman in Houston for the London-based company. 'BP plans to
            defend itself against the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Todd Spitler, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said the company is
            reviewing the claims, although ''such litigation is flawed in
            that energy companies are being held liable not for spilling
            gasoline, but for simply including oxygenates in gasoline as
            required.'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Second-Guessing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;''If a company spills gasoline in Pennsylvania, it is
            required to clean it up, as should be the case,'' Spitler said.
            ''These cases are about second-guessing decisions made by state
            and federal regulators to rely on MTBE-blended gasoline to
            reduce air pollution. We take very seriously our responsibility
            to operate in an environmentally sound manner.'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fernando Garay, a Citgo spokesman, didn't immediately
            return an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania wants the companies held liable for
            manufacturing a defective product, creating public nuisances and
            negligence. The complaint also seeks punitive damages for
            ''wanton, malicious, oppressive and fraudulent conduct,''
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Exxon Mobil
            Corp., 140602881, Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County
            (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Manitowoc Will Consider Relational Proposal for Breakup</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Manitowoc Co. (MTW), the maker of cranes
            and commercial-food appliances, said it held several discussions
            with Relational Investors LLC and will consider the activist
            fund's proposal to break up the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is advising Manitowoc, the
            Wisconsin-based company said today in a statement. Relational
            has amassed an 8.5 percent stake in Manitowoc, according to a
            filing yesterday. The shares rose as much as 12 percent, the
            most since January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Relational, co-founded by Ralph Whitworth and David Batchelder, wants the company to spin off its
            food-service
            business, responsible for ice makers and freezers, from its
            industrial business, which makes and services cranes and boom
            trucks. The fund sees the separation enhancing capital
            allocation and strategic flexibility, and attracting more
            focused shareholders. Relational may seek board representation
            next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The stand-alone crane business would be significantly
            more cyclical and not have the smoother cash flows of the
            foodservice business,' Charles Brady, a Boston-based analyst at
            BMO Capital Markets, said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The food-service unit, which accounted for 38 percent of
            revenue, has an implied enterprise value of $3.9 billion based
            on the valuation of industry peers, Karen Ubelhart, an analyst
            at Bloomberg Industries, said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Higher Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manitowoc climbed 11 percent to $32.93 at the close in New
            York, the biggest one-day gain since Jan. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded in 1902, Manitowoc sold $4 billion in crane
            equipment and commercial food coolers and heaters in 24
            countries last year. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Glen E. Tellock already has announced efforts to
            cut $80 million in
            costs to improve margins. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Manitowoc will likely focus on improving its operational
            efficiencies in cranes and food service while it assesses the
            longer-term merits of any potential spin,' Larry De Maria, a
            New York-based analyst for William Blair Co., said by e-mail
            today. 'It appears that the activist investors are dug in, and
            this process could take some time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Relational, based in San Diego, first disclosed a small
            holding of Manitowoc in February 2013. While the fund held talks
            with management in January, the Manitowoc board hasn't yet
            agreed to meet, yesterday's filing shows. The fund also is
            seeking measures to boost profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Relational manages about $6 billion and regularly presses
            for changes in public companies such as separating diverse
            businesses and finding ways to operate more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Relational also has recently targeted other industrial
            companies including tool and equipment manufacturer SPX Corp. (SPW),
            machinery builder Illinois Tool Works Inc. and hazardous waste
            disposer Clean Harbors Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hess, Bunge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Activist investors tend to buy at least 5 percent of a
            company's stock and flag their intention to actively engage
            executives and directors by disclosing their holding in a 13D
            filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Relational also holds stakes in energy group Hess Corp. (HES),
            agricultural commodity processor Bunge Ltd., snacks supplier
            Mondelez International Inc. and x-ray maker Hologic Inc. among
            others, according to its most recent holdings disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whitworth has served as chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co.

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Fall as Investors Weigh Fed Comments, Data</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, with the Standard Poor's 500 Index snapping a streak of seven monthly gains, as
            comments from Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein spurred concern the central bank may begin to reduce
            stimulus in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc (ACN), the world's second-largest
            technology-consulting company, slumped 10 percent after its quarterly sales forecast missed analysts'
            estimates. International Business Machines Corp. lost 2.3 percent for the biggest retreat in the Dow Jones
            Industrial Average. (INDU) BlackBerry, the Canadian smartphone maker, fell the most in 12 years after
            reporting a surprise quarterly loss. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 (SPX) fell 0.4 percent to 1,606.28 at 4
            p.m. in New York. The index extended today's decline into the close of trading as investors adjusted
            positions at end of the quarter. The Dow lost 114.89 points, or 0.8 percent, to 14,909.60 today. About 10.1
            billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 53 percent above the three-month average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People
            are hearing all these various Fed governors speak and the message they're trying to send isn't necessarily
            any clearer than what was talked about by Bernanke last week,' Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at
            Banyan Partners LLC, said by phone. His firm manages about $1.4 billion. 'I didn't really seen a reason to
            step up to be a buyer on the pullback we had and I didn't see a lot of follow through at least on the
            institutional level.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 yesterday capped the biggest three-day rally since
            early January on better-than-estimated economic data and assurances on stimulus efforts from Fed officials.
            Stein said today the central bank is providing more clarity about how it will wind down its $85 billion in
            monthly bond buying as unemployment falls toward 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Primary Weight' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the Fed makes a decision to begin reducing purchases in September, Stein said in New York, 'it
            will give primary weight to the large stock of news that has accumulated since the inception of the program
            and will not be unduly influenced by whatever data releases arrive in the few weeks before the meeting.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fed Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker, who dissented against additional
            stimulus at every Fed meeting last year, said financial markets will remain volatile as policy makers debate
            how and when to curtail the central bank's asset purchases program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;VIX Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the measure of options on the SP 500 known as
            the VIX, has climbed 49 percent since hitting a six-year low in March. The gauge was unchanged at 16.86
            today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied 13 percent so far this year, the best performance since a
            17 percent gain in the first six months of 1998. It has dropped 3.8 percent since May 21 as Fed Chairman Ben
            S. Bernanke signaled the central bank could taper quantitative easing as the economy improves. The gauge
            slid 1.5 percent in June, its first monthly decline since October. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Business activity in
            the U.S. cooled more than projected in June, a regional report showed. The MNI Chicago Report's business
            barometer dropped to 51.6 from 58.7 in May, which was the highest in more than a year. A reading of 50 is
            the dividing line between expansion and contraction. The median forecast of 55 economists surveyed by
            Bloomberg was 55. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumer sentiment fell less than forecast in June from an almost
            six-year high a month earlier. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan said its final index of confidence
            eased to 84.1 this month from 84.5 at the end of May, which was the highest since July 2007. The median
            forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 83 in the gauge after a preliminary reading of 82.7.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Continued Volatility &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm not surprised to see some pullback from
            three days of strength,' Michael James, a managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in
            Los Angeles, said in an interview. 'But bulls are still not willing to let things come in too much with the
            end of quarter today. Only thing we can count on for the rest of today and next week is continued
            trader-driven volatility, in both directions.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. stock trading accelerated into the
            close, with about 3.8 billion shares, or 38 percent of today's total, changing hands after 3:59 p.m. Trading
            volume averaged about 7.1 billion shares this month, the busiest since November 2011, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The volume figure got a boost today as Russell Investments
            concluded the annual revisions to its equity benchmark gauges. Russell's annual revisions usually spur one
            of the busiest sessions of the year. Today's total was the second highest in 2013 after 10.8 billion shares
            changed hands June 21, an options expiration day. Last year's reconstitution on June 22 helped fuel a jump
            in volume to 9.73 billion shares, the highest total of the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Russell Reconstitution
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russell's global stock indexes, including the Russell 1000 Index and the Russell 2000
            Index, are used as benchmarks for $4.1 trillion in assets, according to the company's website. In three of
            the previous four years, the reconstitution day ranked in the top 20 busiest trading sessions, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health-care shares and phone companies fell the most today, losing
            more than 0.7 percent, as eight of 10 industries retreated. Energy stocks and companies that rely on
            consumer discretionary spending gained, adding at least 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accenture tumbled
            10 percent to $71.96 after saying fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will be $6.7 billion to $7 billion. That
            fell short of the $7.36 billion average estimate of analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. IBM
            (INDU), the world's largest seller of computer services, fell 2.3 percent to $191.11. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;BlackBerry
            Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry (BBRY) fell 28 percent to $10.46, the biggest decline since April
            2000. The company reported a quarterly loss and lower-than-projected sales, hurt by sluggish demand and
            currency restrictions in Venezuela. The loss in the three months through June 1 was 13 cents a share,
            excluding some items. Analysts had estimated a profit of 8 cents on average, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Molycorp Inc., a producer of rare-earth minerals, jumped 11 percent to $6.20.
            The company said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recommended no enforcement action be taken
            after completing an investigation into Molycorp's public disclosures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Only 31 percent of clients who
            employ corporate counsel recommend their primary law firm, down
            from 36 percent last year and 42 percent two years ago, BTI
            consulting Group found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Secondary law firms providing better customer service and
            showing a willingness to adjust to client needs are gaining
            ground the fastest on primary law firm turf,' the consulting
            group said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The conclusions of the survey, in its 13th year, resulted
            from 300 interviews with chief legal officers and general
            counsel at Fortune 1000 companies and large organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those surveyed reported their dissatisfaction with their
            primary law firm because of their inflexibility and
            unwillingness to do anything other than what is asked. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BTI found that 48 percent of corporate clients replaced one
            of their two primary firms in 2012, an increase from 39 percent
            in 2010. The new work went to a firm that had been in a
            secondary role, BTI said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Firm News &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Duane Morris Names Pittsburgh Office Managing Partner &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duane Morris LLP appointed Kenneth M. Argentieri managing
            partner of the firm's Pittsburgh office. Argentieri succeeds
            George Medved, who has held the role since the office opened in
            2003. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentieri, a litigation partner, has been vice-chairman of
            the products liability and toxic torts division of the trial
            practice group. He's handled defamation, environmental,
            securities, class action and commercial law, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh office handles domestic and international
            clients in construction, products liability, commercial and
            bankruptcy litigation, as well as corporate legal matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Since joining us in 2007, Ken has played an increasingly
            substantial part in shaping the Pittsburgh office's strategic
            focus and has proven himself to be a talented and market-savvy
            lawyer,' Duane Morris chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Soroko said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duane Morris has more than 700 attorneys in 24 offices in
            the U.S., London and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cuatrecasas, Gon'alves Pereira, a Spanish law firm
            specializing in corporate clients with about 950 lawyers, named
            Antonio Baena to head its office in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baena, who will focus on mergers and acquisitions and
            corporate finance, takes over from managing partner Inigo Rubio,
            who will return to the firm's main office in Madrid, Cuatrecasas
            said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baena has worked in the securities markets and has been a
            legal adviser for Spain's Frob bank bailout fund and for Sareb,
            its so-called bad bank that absorbed troubled assets from
            nationalized banks, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Transaction and Regulatory Lawyer John Williams Joins Milbank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Milbank, Tweed, Hadley McCloy'LLP said'John Williams, who
            focuses on complex transactional and regulatory work in the
            derivatives space, has joined as a partner in New York. He was
            formerly a partner in the New York office of Allen Overy LLP,
            where he was head of its U.S. derivatives practice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Williams advises clients on derivatives products and on the
            cross-border implications of U.S. derivatives regulations
            enacted in response to the financial crisis, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'John saw the financial crisis as the game-changing event
            it was, and realized that a top-tier transactional practice
            would now depend on offering comprehensive regulatory counsel as
            well,' Milbank Chairman'Scott Edelman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among his past work, Williams was principal U.S. counsel to
            the International Swaps and Derivatives Association in its
            revisions to the credit derivatives product in 2009. He has also
            advised clearing members of ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear
            Europe, as they have dealt with the derivatives clearing mandate
            under Dodd-Frank and the related regulation, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As the regulatory ground continues to shift within the
            derivatives industry, I looked for a firm with a premier
            financial practice that could provide the room for growth that
            the derivatives field demands,' Williams said in a statement
            about Milbank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Milbank has 600 lawyers at 11 offices in the Americas,
            Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;

            Valley office as a partner in the securities litigation and
            white collar defense group. He was previously with the U.S.
            Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, where
            he was an assistant U.S. attorney in the criminal division for
            almost five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fondo will focus on representing technology, life sciences
            and venture capital clients in litigation and investigative
            matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During his time as an AUSA, Fondo prosecuted white-collar
            crime -- including investment, bank and securities fraud -- as
            well as drug trafficking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin's'Silicon Valley office'opened in 2007 and has more
            than 50 attorneys who handle business law and litigation
            services in private equity, venture capital, technology and life
            sciences, intellectual property, SEC investigations, and labor
            and employment matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter has 860 lawyers at nine offices in the

            &lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BP Has Buyer's Remorse Over Spill Accord as Law Firms Circle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until this year, Tampa attorney Kevin McLean specialized in
            suing nursing homes for neglecting patients. In January he
            switched the focus of his practice to a fund BP Plc (BP/) established
            to compensate business losses from the 2010 oil spill in the
            Gulf of Mexico, Bloomberg Businessweek's Paul Barrett reports &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its attempt to dilute a legal and public-relations mess
            of epic proportions, BP began paying claims within weeks of the
            disaster and has so far spent more than $25'billion for cleanup
            and compensation. That hasn't stemmed demands for more. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The installation last year of a particularly generous
            claims administrator prompted scores of additional plaintiffs'
            attorneys to swarm onto the scene, signing up a new wave of
            clients, many located far from the once-sullied shoreline. Just
            five months after his pivot, McLean's three-attorney firm has
            260'clients with claims ranging from $20,000 to $4'million each. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The craziest thing about the settlement,' he wrote in a
            solicitation letter, 'is that you can be compensated for losses
            that are UNRELATED to the spill.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of McLean's clients, a real estate agent in Brandon,
            Florida, an hour from the Gulf of Mexico, wants $80,000 from
            London-based BP, reflecting a revenue dip in 2010 that 'had
            nothing to do with the spill,' the attorney candidly admits.
            The culprit was the bursting of the Florida real estate bubble.
            Under the settlement, though, 'that's a good claim,' McLean
            said, 'and we're going to get paid.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He has millions of reasons to be confident. A construction
            company in northern Alabama, 200'miles from the coast, was
            recently awarded $9.7'million, even though it does no work near
            the Gulf, according to court records. Attorneys are submitting
            claims on their own behalf. A law office in central Louisiana
            that actually enjoyed improved profits in 2010 collected $3.3
            million. The compensation process is confidential, so claimants'
            identities aren't a matter of public record, though the amounts
            are. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The blowout of the Macondo well cost 11'men their lives
            and, according to the government, spewed 4'million barrels of
            oil into the Gulf. It shut down fisheries and despoiled beaches.
            Oystermen and charter boat captains lost months and, in some
            cases, years of work. While much of the Gulf economy has
            recovered, degraded oil remains in coastal marshes in Louisiana.
            Some ruined small businesses never reopened. &lt;/p&gt;

            firing 60 associates and 110 support staffers, and cutting the

            downsizings, according to law firm consultant Bruce MacEwen,
            publisher of the blog Adam Smith, Esq. The cuts put Weil in a
            stronger position, he says, but that's not always the case. He
            discusses how to tell if a firm is making cuts from a position

            &lt;h2&gt;Global Cartel Fines Dip Before Libor, Car-Parts Penalties &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global criminal cartel fines dipped during the first part
            of the year in a pause before hefty penalties are likely to be
            imposed in probes of Libor and car parts, law firm Allen Overy
            LLP said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The penalties so far this year have totaled $677 million,
            less than a fifth of the more than $5 billion levied during
            2012, Allen Overy said in a report yesterday. The drop-off was
            most pronounced at the two biggest antitrust regulators, the
            U.S. and European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allen Overy partner John Terzaken said the EU is likely
            to levy large fines later this year in probes of car parts and
            the London interbank offered rate, where it lags behind its U.S.
            colleagues. The U.S. and U.K. have already fined three banks
            about $2.5 billion in the Libor probes and almost $1 billion in
            fines have been issued in the U.S. and Japan in the
            investigation of auto-parts makers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There will be some judgments by the end of the year,'
            said Terzaken, a former director of criminal enforcement at the
            U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust division. 'They want to
            show some momentum and keep the cases moving along.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. criminal antitrust fines in the first six months of
            the year were $192 million, compared with $1.1 billion in all of
            2012. The EU fines so far this year totalled $72 million,
            compared with $2.3 billion in 2012, according to London-based
            Allen Overy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. and EU fines have slowed, regulators in
            China, Australia, Brazil and South Africa are 'coming into
            their own,' Terzaken said. The South African regulator this
            week issued a 1.46 billion rand ($146 million) penalty against
            15 construction companies and China prosecuted an international
            cartel for the first time, leading to a 353 million yuan ($57.4
            million) fine against makers of liquid-crystal display panels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The antitrust practice has been global for a long time,
            but it has become more global as the years have gone by,'
            Terzaken said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California Regulator's Top Lawyer Recuses Himself From PGE Case &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California Public Utilities Commission General Counsel
            Frank Lindh recused himself as chief advisory attorney in
            investigations into a PGE Corp. (PCG) pipeline explosion that killed
            eight people in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lindh will be replaced by retired CPUC assistant general
            counsel Arocles Aguilar, according to an e-mailed statement from
            the agency. Some CPUC lawyers working on the probes and proposed
            penalties for PGE had asked to be reassigned, the regulator
            said June 5. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goodwin Procter to Close San Diego Office, Fire Staff</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP is closing its
            San Diego office at the end of the law firm's fiscal year,
            leaving about two-thirds of the 34 lawyers and staff without a
            job on Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Four partners, six other lawyers and 12 staff members will
            be let go, Lee Feldman, a firm spokesman, said today in an e-mail. The remainder will be offered
            opportunities to relocate or
            pursue other work arrangements. The office has six partners, 12
            associates and 16 staff members, according to a memo by Chairman
            Regina M. Pisa and managing partner Robert S. Insolia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When we opened the office in March 2007, we envisioned
            that the San Diego office would be a significant source of
            corporate transactional work, particularly in the life sciences
            and biotech areas,' Pisa and Insolia said in the memo. 'While
            this was the case initially, and while these practices have
            continued to grow nationally at the firm, we haven't been able
            to realize our initial vision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some law firms are trimming payrolls because of a slowdown
            in business since the 2008 financial meltdown and competition
            from lower-cost legal-service providers. Weil, Gotshal Manges
            LLP, based in New York, said this week that it will fire 60
            salaried lawyers and 110 staff and cut some partners' pay.
            Patton Boggs LLP, based in Washington, fired 65 employees in
            March, including 22 associates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;California Sites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter said in the memo that it plans to build the
            firm's life sciences and biotechnology practice in California
            through its three other offices in the state -- in Los Angeles,
            San Francisco and Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Boston-based firm was ranked 39th on the American
            Lawyer magazine's list of wealthiest U.S. law firms with
            $715.5 million in gross revenue last year, a 2.9 percent
            increase from the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The San Diego closing will leave Goodwin Procter with about
            800 lawyers at eight offices in the U.S., London and Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Hires JPMorgan's Mirza to Run Currency Trading</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, hired
            Kayhan Mirza from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) as global head of
            foreign-exchange trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mirza accepted a position as partner at Goldman Sachs,
            Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said
            today by phone. DuVally declined to comment on reporting lines
            in the business. Guy Saidenberg has held the role of global head
            of foreign-exchange trading at Goldman Sachs. He declined to
            comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
            investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
            industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
            bank's currency business had 'difficulty managing inventory'
            in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
            trading revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost at least two partners from its currency-trading business this year. Leland Lim,
            co-head of macro trading
            for Asia ex-Japan, left to start a hedge fund. Steven Cho,
            global head of spot and forward trading of G-10 currencies in
            New York, also departed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least a dozen regulators are investigating allegations
            first reported by Bloomberg News in June that traders colluded
            to rig benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market.
            That is boosting demand from clients for greater transparency in
            pricing and transaction charges, accelerating a longer-term
            shift in trading onto electronic platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Electronic Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Electronic dealing, which accounted for 66 percent of all
            currency transactions in 2013 and 20 percent in 2001, will
            increase to 76 percent within five years, according to Aite
            Group LLC, a Boston-based consulting firm that reviewed Bank for
            International Settlements data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mirza had served as JPMorgan's head of foreign-exchange
            trading in Europe, Middle East and Africa and global head of FX
            options trading. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said the U.S. and its allies will keep raising pressure on Russia to back
            down in Ukraine and held open the possibility of further sanctions if Vladimir Putin's government doesn't
            respond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama spoke at the White House after his administration restricted visas for
            Ukrainian officials and others, including Russians, who it says are threatening Ukraine's sovereignty. He
            also authorized financial sanctions, leaving the imposition of any restrictions until later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'These
            decisions continue our efforts to impose a cost on Russia,' Obama said, adding that the actions were taken
            in close coordination with European allies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More on the Crisis in Ukraine:&lt;/p&gt;

            return the Black Sea peninsula to Russia would violate the Ukrainian constitution as well as international
            law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are well beyond the days when borders can be redrawn over the heads of
            democratic leaders,' Obama said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The impact of U.S. actions depends on whether the
            European Union joins in. Leaders of the 28-nation bloc meeting in Brussels today halted trade and visa
            negotiations with Russia and prepared sanctions against selected Russian officials amid disagreements about
            how fast to move. &lt;/p&gt;

            Andrew Procter, will leave for law firm Herbert Smith Freehills
            LLP as the company grapples with regulatory probes and lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Procter, who was also Deutsche Bank's head of government
            and regulatory affairs, will join the law firm's financial
            services regulatory practice as a partner in June, London-based
            Herbert Smith Freehills said in a statement on its website
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Procter, 52, will work at Deutsche Bank with deputy
            compliance chief Daniela Weber-Rey and regional compliance heads
            during a transitional period, the bank said in an e-mail to
            staff. Regina Schueller, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based
            company, confirmed the contents of the memo by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Europe's biggest investment bank by revenue,
            had more than 2.5 billion euros ($3.43 billion) of legal costs
            last year and still faces investigations into whether it rigged
            benchmark interest rates as well as litigation related to the
            sale of securities without proper disclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Procter led the U.K. Financial Services Authority's

        <headline>ISS Shares Advance in Denmark's Biggest IPO in Two Decades</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ISS Holding A/S, the world's
            largest cleaning company, jumped as much as 13 percent in its
            first day of trading in Denmark's biggest initial public
            offering in 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS's new shares traded as high as 180 kroner in
            Copenhagen, compared with the IPO price of 160 kroner. The
            initial price range set during the offer was 140 kroner to 175
            kroner. ISS said it raised gross proceeds of 8.04 billion kroner
            ($1.5 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale of ISS, whose owners include Goldman Sachs Capital
            Partners and EQT Partners AB, will be the largest IPO in Denmark
            since the 1994 listing of TDC A/S. Companies in Europe raised
            $10 billion from listings so far this year, about three times
            the amount in the same period in 2013, as investors bet on an
            economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'ISS's defensive business model gives new investors the
            prospect of stable growth, stable earnings, a good cash-flow and
            very solid dividends,' Soeren Loentoft Hansen, an analyst with
            Aabenraa, Denmark-based Sydbank A/S, said in a note. He's
            starting coverage of ISS with a buy recommendation, and sees
            room for the shares to advance as much as 25 percent from the
            IPO price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Existing Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS's new stock traded at 179.3 kroner at 9:59 a.m. in
            Copenhagen with 4.09 million shares traded. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to the 50.2 million new shares sold by ISS,
            Goldman Sachs and EQT will sell 1 million existing shares. ISS
            will have a market value of about 29.6 billion kroner, excluding
            the value of treasury shares held by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have received very positive feedback from investors,'
            ISS Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gravenhorstsaid in today's
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. retailers Poundland Group Plc and Pets at Home Ltd.
            began trading yesterday after closing their sales early because
            of high demand from investors. Poundland gained 23 percent, and
            Pets at Home fell about 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS said about 10 percent of its shares were allocated to
            Danish retail investors while the rest went to institutional
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS, based in Soeborg, Denmark, said on Feb. 18 it would
            raise 8 billion kroner to repay debt. The company said on March
            11 it would close the share sale early after receiving strong
            demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, which has more than 530,000 employees, offers
            facility management services in more than 50 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS pulled an IPO in March 2011, citing market uncertainty.
            Later that year, G4S Plc said it abandoned a takeover pursuit of
            ISS after the security services provider's shareholders
            revolted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nordea Bank AB, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are
            sale managers. Lazard is acting as financial adviser to ISS. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yen in Longest Stretch of Wins Since May on Ukraine; Ruble Drops</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The yen gained for a fifth day
            versus the dollar, the longest stretch in 10 months, as
            investors sought haven assets before a referendum this weekend
            that may lead to Crimea's secession from Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble dropped versus all except two of its 31 major
            counterparts as Russia remained on a collision course with the
            West after six hours of talks between the country's top
            diplomats failed to ease tensions. The euro jumped as much as
            0.5 percent versus the dollar amid speculation technical signals
            triggered automatic selling orders, known as stops. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Definitely the market is very nervous on Russia, the
            Ukraine situation and the Crimea vote this weekend -- it's
            driving all risk off,' said Masafumi Takada, a New York-based
            director at BNP Paribas SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen climbed 0.5 percent to 101.36 per dollar at 5 p.m.
            in New York, extending this week's gain to 1.9 percent, the most
            since Jan. 24. It last ended a five-day winning streak on May 1.
            Japan's currency advanced 0.2 percent to 141.03 per euro. The
            shared currency gained 0.3 percent to $1.3914 and touched
            $1.3937. The Swiss franc appreciated 0.3 percent to 87.24
            centimes per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It looks like a few euro-dollar stops have been taken
            out,' Stephen Collins, global head of dealing at the money
            manager London Capital Group Ltd., said in a telephone
            interview from London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Higher Volatility &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG's Currency Volatility Index, based on
            three-month implied volatility on nine major currency pairs,
            rose for a second day. It increased to 7.63 percent, the highest
            since March 3, after falling to 7.14 percent on March 12, the
            lowest level since December 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent to 36.6326 per dollar and
            touched 36.7037, the weakest level since March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met in London with
            Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to press the nation to
            halt a takeover of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The mostly Russian-speaking region is scheduled to vote on
            secession on March 16. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said
            yesterday Russia is risking 'massive' political and economic
            damage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, 'is not prepared to
            make any decision regarding Ukraine until after the referendum
            on Sunday,' Kerry told a news conference after the meeting.
            Russia 'will respect the will of the Crimean peoples,' Lavrov
            told a separate news conference, saying there's 'no common
            vision' on resolving the crisis. Russia has no plans to invade
            the region, Lavrov said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Position Defensively' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has asked the U.S. for military assistance and
            equipment, according to an American defense official, who asked
            not to be identified discussing private communications. Pentagon
            officials have indicated the focus at the moment should be on
            diplomatic and economic aid, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Markets will continue to position defensively ahead of
            the Crimean referendum on Sunday, with investors wary of
            potential further escalation of geopolitical risks,' said
            Valentin Marinov, head of European Group-of-10 currency strategy
            at Citigroup Inc. in London. 'Liquid safe havens like the yen
            and Swiss franc should do well. The market is turning short U.S.
            dollars against the majors.' A short position is a bet an asset
            will fall. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Net Longs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures traders increased their bets the franc will gain
            against the dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity
            Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of
            wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on an advance
            in the franc versus those on a drop -- so-called net longs --
            was 8,957 on March 11, compared with net longs of 2,168 a week
            earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The difference in the number of wagers by large speculators
            on a decline in the yen against the greenback versus those on a
            gain -- so-called net shorts -- increased to 99,356, compared
            with net shorts of 79,709 a week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dollar remained lower versus the yen as the Labor
            Department reported the U.S. producer price index fell 0.1
            percent after a 0.2 percent rise the prior month. The median
            estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.2 percent
            increase. Over the past 12 months, wholesale prices increased
            0.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was a fair bit lower than our expectation,' Brian Daingerfield, a Stamford, Connecticut-based
            currency strategist
            at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in a telephone
            interview. 'The reaction has been fairly muted in the foreign-exchange space.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Yen's Advance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen has risen 3.4 percent this year, the best performer
            after New Zealand's dollar of 10 developed-nation currencies
            tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
            gained 0.4 percent, while the U.S. dollar fell 0.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan maintained record stimulus this week,
            keeping ammunition amid speculation a sales-tax increase in
            April will hurt the economy. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
            predict the economy will shrink 3.8 percent in the second
            quarter, when an increase in the consumption tax is scheduled to
            take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Africa's rand was the biggest winner among the
            dollar's major counterparts, gaining 1.3 percent to 10.6711 to
            the greenback. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea's won, the biggest loser, declined 0.3 percent
            to 1,072.78 to the greenback. It had its largest weekly drop in
            almost two months, 1.1 percent, as slowing economic growth in
            China, the nation's biggest foreign market, prompted investors
            to seek safer assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas investors sold $1.2 billion more South Korean
            stocks than they bought this week as official data showed
            exports in China contracted the most since 2009 in February and
            factory output rose less than forecast in the past two months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian currency, the second-biggest loser, declined
            0.3 percent to C$1.1105 per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Beat Goldman in Commodities Revenue Last Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) leapfrogged Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year to be the largest bank in
            raw materials revenue before announcing the $3.5 billion sale of its physical commodities business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, which earned the most money from raw materials among the top 10 investment banks in 2012,
            ranked second last year and Morgan Stanley was third, London-based analytics company Coalition said in a
            report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two of the top three banks by commodities revenue, JPMorgan and
            Morgan Stanley, are selling parts of the business amid slumping revenue and concern among regulators that
            banks could control prices if they own commodities as well as trade them, or suffer losses that would
            endanger the financial system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 18
            percent last year to $4.5 billion because of a 'depressed client environment' and low volatility, Coalition
            estimated in February. The Standard Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials dropped last year for the first
            time since 2008. The gauge's 100-day historic volatility fell to as low as 10.5 percent in April, from as
            much as 23.8 percent in January 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal
            Reserve said in July it might force insured lenders to get out of physical commodities, and JPMorgan agreed
            later that month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated power markets, without admitting
            wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the
            Coalition report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mercuria Purchase &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said yesterday it's
            selling its physical commodities unit to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. for $3.5 billion. The unit had $3.3
            billion in assets and generated $750 million in annual operating profit before compensation costs, according
            to people who have seen documents related to the sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank will continue to provide
            services and products tied to commodities including financing, market-making and the vaulting and trading of
            precious metals, it said yesterday. JPMorgan was the top lender to mining and energy companies last year,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley agreed in December to sell its global
            oil merchant unit to OAO Rosneft. The terms of the deal weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank
            AG (DBK), Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas SA were among 'tier two' performers, rated No. 4 to No. 6 for
            commodity revenue, Coalition said, without providing specific rankings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the
            largest investment bank, with $23.3 billion in revenue and $12.5 billion in fixed income, currencies and
            commodities, Coalition said. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Deutsche Bank and Citigroup Inc.
            (C) tied for second place in investment banking revenue, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Joins JPMorgan in Scrapping 'Sell' Call on Teva</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts at JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are abandoning their
            sell ratings on Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) as the stock
            posts its best quarterly rally since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All three banks raised their recommendations on Teva, the
            world's biggest maker of generic drugs, to neutral from sell in
            the past two weeks as the stock soared to a three-year high in
            New York trading. The analysts said the company is making
            progress in its push to maintain market share of its best-selling drug Copaxone while a boom in mergers and
            acquisitions
            in the industry yields deals of as much as $21 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva have rallied 23
            percent this year. The stock, the biggest investment in
            billionaire George Soros's fund, is the third-best performer on
            the Market Vectors U.S. Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Price Index
            after trailing the 21 other companies in the measure in 2013.
            Mounting concern about the company's leadership and growth
            outlook has sent Teva's valuation to 11 times estimated
            earnings, the second-lowest multiple among 15 global generic
            drug makers tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The upgrades are not saying everything is great but, at
            the valuation it got to' investors are reconsidering their
            positions, Jacob de Tusch-Lec, who helps oversee about $23
            billion in equities at Artemis Investment Management LLP in
            London, said by phone on March 20. 'Essentially things have not
            gotten worse.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Weekly Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index rose 2.5 percent to
            119.39 last week, the most since Feb. 14, extending its gain
            this year to 7.3 percent. The TA-25 Index advanced 0.7 percent
            at today's close in Israel, extending its 2014 advance to 4.7
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, Lauren Bellmare at Morgan Stanley, and Amanda
            Smith at JPMorgan
            declined to comment on their analysts' reports. Denise Bradley,
            a spokeswoman for Teva in North Wales, Pennsylvania, didn't
            respond to an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been advising clients to buy Mylan Inc. (MYL), the
            biggest U.S. generic-drug maker, since October 2007. The shares
            have more than tripled since then. Morgan Stanley rated Perrigo
            Co. (PRGO), a maker of generic over-the-counter medicines, the
            equivalent of buy on Feb. 4, 2013, before a 50 percent rally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva converted 8.7 percent of 20-milligram Copaxone
            prescriptions to its 40-milligram version in the week ended Feb.
            28, according to Bloomberg Industries. Leerink Partners and
            Cowen Co. analysts said the results mean the company may
            deliver on its plan to get 30 percent to 50 percent of patients
            on the three-times-weekly injection. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;$4 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moving patients to the new version is key because the
            remaining U.S. patent on the $4 billion-drug expires at the end
            of May, while the new version will be protected from generic
            competition until 2030. Teva's next hurdle will be persuading
            insurers in the U.S. to continue paying for the branded, three-times-a-week shot once a cheaper copycat of
            the daily version
            becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fifteen out of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg
            recommend buying Teva's shares, the highest level since
            September. Thirteen analysts have a hold rating, while one says
            sell, the data showed. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 172.60
            shekels, or the equivalent of $49.54, today in Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A wave of mergers and acquisitions among generic drug
            companies has also triggered a rally in Teva's shares, according
            to Jason Kolbert, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Actavis Plc (ACT) agreed to purchase Forest Laboratories Inc. for
            $25 billion last month, and Mylan Inc. Chief Executive Heather Bresch said Feb. 27 that the generic-drug
            maker may make a large
            acquisition this year. Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh said
            March 4 that Teva is open for deals as the pace of industry
            consolidation quickens. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Hot Topic' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The acquisition of generic companies has now become a
            very hot topic,' Kolbert, who has a buy rating for Teva, said
            in a March 20 phone interview from New York. Actavis' purchase
            was a 'gift' for the Israeli drugmaker, he said. 'That was
            the trigger that got people focusing on Teva.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management LLC, the family office of billionaire
            George Soros, boosted its stake in Teva in the last three months
            of 2013, making the Israeli drugmaker its largest holding in the
            fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Next Wal-Mart CEO Faces Challenges Sam Walton Never Saw</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;As Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) prepares to anoint the fifth chief executive in its history, the
            world's largest retailer is grappling with challenges founder Sam Walton never faced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart's

            operations, as leading candidates to succeed Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke, according to a person
            familiar with the situation. While Duke, 63, isn't expected to step down immediately, Wal-Mart may name his
            successor in the coming months, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
            private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart is trying to goose slowing sales gains in the U.S. as such rivals as
            Amazon.com Inc. and the dollar stores lure its customers. Overseas, the company is struggling to ignite
            growth in China and other emerging markets even as it probes allegations of bribery in Mexico and possible
            violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next CEO will face 'tough decisions
            globally,' said David Strasser, a New York-based analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. 'They have to pick
            and choose. China has been a big struggle. What do you do? Double down? Back out?' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            the U.S. 'they're dealing with a more competitive landscape and a consumer who is struggling,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Network News Pioneer Barbara Walters to Retire From ABC in 2014</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Barbara Walters, the first woman to
            co-anchor a network evening newscast, will retire in 2014 after
            one more year on ABC News and her talk show, 'The View.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walters will make the announcement today on 'The View,'
            the daytime program she created in 1997, Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ABC
            said on its website. She will report and anchor for the news
            division and appear on 'The View' until next summer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ABC plans to honor the groundbreaking newscaster with a
            career retrospective next May. Walters started at NBC's 'Today
            Show' in 1961 and rose to become co-anchor, with Harry Reasoner, of 'ABC Evening News' in 1976. Walters has
            interviewed every U.S. president and first lady since Richard Nixon, ABC News said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walters, 81, is a co-host of 'The View,' where she will
            continue as executive producer. She will anchor ABC News
            specials over the next 12 months including a '20 Years of 10
            Most Fascinating People' special in December and an Oscars
            special. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Walters announcement comes as ABC and other networks
            present their fall prime-time lineups to advertisers this week
            in New York. ABC releases its schedule this week. NBC said
            yesterday it will bring back Michael J. Fox in a comedy on
            Thursday nights. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walters became nationally known as a television personality
            on the 'Today' show in the 1960s, eventually becoming co-host
            of the program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Begin, Sadat &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Over the years she interviewed Russia's Boris Yeltsin,
            China's Jiang Zemin, former U.K. prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Libya's Muammar Qaddafi and Iraq's Saddam
            Hussein,
            according to her biography. She crossed the Bay of Pigs with
            Cuba's Fidel Castro, ABC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1977, Walters was the first journalist to arrange a
            joint interview with Egypt President Anwar Sadat and Israeli
            Prime Minister Menachem Begin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walter's 1999 interview with Monica Lewinsky, the first one
            granted to TV by the former Clinton White House intern, remains
            the highest-rated news program aired by a single network,
            according to the biography. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She was also the first American journalist to interview
            Russia's President Vladimir Putin and scored the first interview
            with President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush after
            the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In September 2004, after 25 years as co-host and chief
            correspondent for ABC News' '20/20,' Walters left the show to
            focus on 'Barbara Walters Specials.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, gained 0.8 percent to
            $67.20 on May 10 in New York, an all-time high. The stock has
            advanced 35 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Soros Added to Google Last Quarter, Cut Apple and AIG</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;George Soros's Soros Fund Management
            LLC added to its stake in Google Inc. (GOOG) in the first quarter while
            cutting its holding of Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund added 148,531 shares of Google in the quarter,
            bringing its total to 337,271 shares, according to a filing
            today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
            firm's stake in the Mountain View, California-based company was
            valued at $267.9 million at the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm, a family office for the billionaire, sold its
            position in JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), valued at $113 million at the
            end of last year, according to the filing with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soros Fund Management reduced its stake in Apple by 157,176
            shares to 26,800 shares valued at $11.9 million, according to
            the filing. Apple declined 17 percent in the first three months
            of the year, even as U.S. stocks added 10 percent, on signs that
            sales growth for the iPhone is slowing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soros also cut its holding in American International Group
            Inc. by two-thirds in the quarter amid a share rally. The firm
            still owns 2.89 million shares of the company, worth $112
            million at the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Walter O'Brien, BB&amp;amp;T Equities Chief Who Was Mentor, Dies at 46</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walter J. O'Brien III, head of equity sales and trading at BBT Corp. (BBT) and a mentor to
            finance-minded graduates of his alma mater, the University of Richmond in Virginia, has died. He was 46.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He died on May 10 at his home in Richmond, his wife, Debra, said yesterday in an
            interview. The cause was colon cancer, which was diagnosed in February 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Known as
            Joe, O'Brien held jobs on Wall Street at Smith Barney and Citicorp Inc. before joining Scott Stringfellow
            Inc., a regional brokerage, investment banking and financial services firm in Richmond that billed itself as
            the U.S. South's oldest continuous member of the New York Stock Exchange. BBT, North Carolina's
            second-biggest bank after Bank of America Corp., bought Scott Stringfellow in 1999. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BBT,
            based in Winston-Salem, promoted O'Brien to senior vice president of capital markets in 2002. He rose to
            managing director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A member of the Executive Advisory Council of the University of
            Richmond's Robins School of Business, O'Brien took many students 'under his wing,' according to an article
            in the university's alumni magazine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It told of an MBA candidate, Grant Garcia, who
            drove to BBT's offices in downtown Richmond, 'sometimes before dawn, to sit at O'Brien's desk learning the
            markets, a relationship they continued for almost two years.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Leg Up' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Garcia,
            29, now works in securitized product sales at Credit Suisse Securities in New York. He said yesterday in an
            interview that his unpaid experience with O'Brien was valuable and gave him a leg up in a tough job market.
            When Garcia graduated from Robins in 2009, he landed a job at Bank of America's Merrill Lynch brokerage
            unit, then moved to the U.S. unit of Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He really
            changed my life,' Garcia said. 'He gave me the foundation during a really hard period of time in the
            economy. His door was always open. Every time he came to New York we'd go out for a drink or for dinner.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an e-mail to the Robins community, Dean Nancy A. Bagranoff wrote, 'Joe showed great
            courage as he dealt with his illness. He will be much missed by us all.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walter Joseph
            O'Brien III was born on Nov. 26, 1966, in London to Nancy Malmuth and Walter J. O'Brien Jr. He was raised in
            Chicago and New York. His father was president of J. Walter Thompson, then the world's largest advertising
            agency, and later ran two other firms, according to a biography for a Richmond non-profit group where he
            serves on the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1985, the son graduated from the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville,
            Connecticut, and in 1989 earned an economics degree from Richmond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O'Brien was a senior
            vice president at Citicorp when he left New York for Scott Stringfellow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Survivors
            include his wife, Debra, a graduate of New York University's Stern School of Business and adjunct associate
            professor of information systems at Richmond; a son, Connor, 13; a daughter, Caitlin, 10; his parents and
            stepmother, Margaret O'Brien. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Said to Hire JPMorgan's Strain for Real Estate Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired
            Jonathan Strain as a managing director in its commercial-mortgage bond business, according to two people
            familiar with
            the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strain, previously at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), will be co-head
            of the U.S. real estate finance group alongside Ted Borter, said
            one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            move hasn't been announced. He will be based at the lender's New
            York headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is bolstering the team that underwrites bond
            deals linked to everything from skyscrapers to strip malls as
            Wall Street banks vie for the most lucrative lending assignments
            amid growing competition. The number of firms originating
            property loans to be packaged into securities has almost tripled
            to 27 since issuance revived in 2010 following the financial
            crisis, according to Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strain, who started at JPMorgan in 2007, is joining Goldman
            Sachs after the departure earlier this year of Dan Bennett, who
            held a similar position. Justin Perras, a spokesman for
            JPMorgan, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
            they couldn't comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of commercial-mortgage backed securities is
            falling short of predictions of a banner year, pushing
            underwriters to be more aggressive to meet their origination
            goals. Banks have arranged about $25 billion of CMBS this year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg, on track to disappoint
            Wall Street forecasts for as much as $100 billion in 2014
            issuance after sales doubled to $80 billion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the fourth-ranked underwriter of U.S.
            CMBS last year, according to industry newsletter Commercial
            Mortgage Alert. JPMorgan was second, behind top-ranked Deutsche
            Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Lower-Rung U.S. Workers Get Leg Up in Bankers' View: Economy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Life is looking up for Marco Ruiz, whose four months of unemployment ended in December when a
            landscaping company in Dallas hired him at $9.50 an hour, with small raises since then and a promotion two
            weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Things have gotten better,' said the 44-year-old, a maintenance supervisor
            at The Grounds Guys, which also added a part-time worker this year as sales are climbing. 'This is a good
            job. I'm making $12 an hour.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five years into the economic recovery, better days are
            finally arriving at the bottom of the job market. Since late 2013, unemployment has declined more rapidly
            for workers with a high school education than those with some college, and incomes for less-skilled and
            lower-paid employees have grown faster than for those near the top of the ladder, according to government
            data analyzed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
            Yellen Adds Full-Employment Definition

            Graphic: Yellen's Labor Market Dashboard

            &lt;p&gt;'It looks like things are turning,' said Jan Hatzius, chief economist for Goldman Sachs in New
            York. The pickup is 'looking a bit stronger for less skilled, lower paid workers. There's been a little bit
            of the closing of the gap over the last year or so.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better performance at the low end
            of the labor market, while helpful to the economy, hardly makes a dent in income inequality. The chasm
            between the richest 1 percent and remaining 99 percent is the widest since the 1920s, according to research
            by economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley and Thomas Piketty of the Paris
            School of Economics. Nonetheless, economists at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase Co. say the data on
            Americans at the low end of the wage and skills spectrum are looking more encouraging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Education
            Levels &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unemployment among workers with a high school education or less fell to 6.3
            percent in April, down about one percentage point from December, according to Labor Department data cited by
            Hatzius. In the same period, workers with at least some college saw a smaller drop, to 5.7 percent from 6.1
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, JPMorgan Hold Out With Bet on Aussie Rate Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;And then there were three: Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Co. and Macquarie Group Ltd.
            are sticking to bets the Reserve Bank of Australia will resume
            lowering interest rates as others ditch their rate-cut calls. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Westpac Banking Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd. and
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists -- with a century in
            combined experience -- now expect the RBA will maintain the
            record-low 2.5 percent cash rate. While keeping expectations for
            sub-par growth, they've bowed to Governor Glenn Stevens's
            insistence borrowing costs are on hold for 'some time yet.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's Tim Toohey, JPMorgan's Stephen Walters and
            Macquarie's Richard Gibbs think Stevens is wrong, with subdued
            prices, a forecast rise in unemployment, an elevated currency
            and government budget cuts seen forcing further reductions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You've got fiscal tightening being accelerated, so
            there's absolutely no scope for the Reserve Bank to be
            considering hiking rates,' Sydney-based Gibbs said in a May 19
            interview. On the same day, Walters said he sees unemployment
            rising, the currency too high and the budget weighing on growth,
            while recognizing 'something will have to change' to prompt
            the RBA to overcome its reluctance to lower rates again. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's treasurer last week announced cuts to spending
            on welfare and the public service and a new tax on the highest
            paid, adding fiscal consolidation to a slump in mining
            investment as brakes on growth. At stake: the survival of a
            domestic demand revival that's seen the jobless rate drop, house
            prices surge, and most economists and financial markets abandon
            any expectation of further monetary policy easing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fiscal Grind &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer sentiment plunged 6.8 percent to 92.9 in May from
            a month earlier, an index from Westpac and the Melbourne
            Institute showed today. That's the lowest level since August
            2011, prior to the central bank's most recent easing cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In an environment where domestic demand is already
            fragile and significant risks remain in the handover from mining
            led economic growth, this budget does pose a risk to the near
            term outlook,' Goldman's Melbourne-based Chief Australia
            Economist Toohey wrote in a note to clients dated May 14. 'A
            return to the grind of fiscal repair looms large.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walters and Gibbs say the budget cuts and resulting hit to
            consumer confidence from the measures, a stubbornly high
            currency, rising unemployment as growth remains below trend and
            incomplete transition from mining investment will prompt another
            move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gee, that's positive for the Aussie dollar,' Gibbs cited
            foreign investors as saying after the budget release forecast
            narrowing deficits, meaning the elevated Aussie will remain a
            drag on growth. 'It's the tightening of conditions leading to
            probably another round of job losses and pressure on domestic
            demand' that will drive the RBA to cut again, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Aussie Dollar &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar has firmed since Stevens switched to
            a neutral bias in February, curbing exporters' competitiveness.
            It traded at 92.38 U.S. cents at 12:16 p.m. in Sydney. Swaps
            traders see the cash rate moving 3 basis points higher in a
            year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index, down from 8
            points yesterday and from 3 points in cuts on March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even those economists who have abandoned rate-cut calls
            recently and now see the central bank remaining on hold for an
            extended period don't necessarily believe it should be. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It doesn't reflect any change of view on our part about
            the outlook,' said Merrill Lynch's Chief Australia Economist
            Saul Eslake, who on May 16 switched his rate call to on hold.
            'Dropping it doesn't mean we've become a lot more optimistic or
            less pessimistic about the economy, just that we now accept the
            Reserve Bank is reading things differently from us and it's
            their view that counts, not ours.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Sharp Fall' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Westpac's Bill Evans, who called the most recent easing
            cycle, abandoned his prediction of further rate cuts in March
            after stronger-than-expected jobs data and said the central bank
            was indicating a 'high hurdle' for easier policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The sharp fall in the index is clearly indicating an
            unfavorable response to the recent federal budget,' Evans said
            today of the sentiment slump. 'Respondents were particularly
            concerned about the impact of the budget on their own
            finances.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NAB's Alan Oster announced he had dropped his reduction
            call on May 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Low rates have spurred property prices. House and apartment
            prices in the largest cities climbed 11.5 percent in April from
            a year earlier, led by a 16.7 percent increase in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Export Boom &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Government data released this month showed Australia's
            exports to China, its biggest trading partner, climbed to a
            record A$9.5 billion ($8.8 billion) in March, even as the trade
            surplus narrowed to A$731 million for the month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The RBA maintained its steady view in minutes of the May 6
            meeting released yesterday in Sydney. 'Overall growth in coming
            quarters was likely to be below trend given expected slower
            growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the
            planned fiscal consolidation,' it said. 'The current
            accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for
            some time yet.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation's Secretary to the Treasury Martin Parkinson, in
            his traditional speech after the budget, said non-mining
            industries need to grow more rapidly to keep unemployment low. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are seeing some positive signs, particularly in the
            household sector,' he said in Sydney yesterday. 'But with
            businesses in the non-resources sectors continuing to exercise
            caution in their investment and hiring decisions, the forward
            indicators suggest that it will be at least another year or two
            before strong broad-based growth takes hold.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, when he made his call for the RBA to cut rates in
            July 2011, was Australia's loneliest forecaster at the time. Yet
            within a few weeks markets swung to his view. In 2009,
            JPMorgan's Walters was alone in picking Stevens's decision to
            become the first Group of 20 policy maker to boost rates after
            the height of the global recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our job is to forecast what the Reserve Bank will do, not
            preach as to what they should do,' Eslake said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Senate Panel Approves Immigration Plan With Hatch Changes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee
            approved legislation revising U.S. immigration law that includes
            an agreement between Senator Orrin Hatch and Democrats on visas
            for high-skilled foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 to approve the
            measure authored by a group of four Democrats and four
            Republicans. Republican Hatch and two Republican co-authors of
            the bill, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South
            Carolina, joined all of the panel's Democrats in voting for it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even with the Republican support, Flake said the measure
            will require more changes on the Senate floor to win passage
            there and have a chance in the Republican-led House. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a lot of work to do on this, but this was a great
            process,' Flake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, has
            said he wants to bring the measure to the full Senate 'as soon
            as it's ready,' probably in early June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senator Patrick Leahy, the committee chairman and a Vermont
            Democrat, withdrew an amendment to provide immigrants in same-sex marriages with U.S. citizens equal
            benefits to heterosexual
            couples after Democrats and Republicans unanimously spoke
            against it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We now know this is going to blow the agreement apart,'
            said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. 'I
            don't want to blow this bill apart.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Obama Statement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama in a statement after the vote
            congratulated the committee on its approval of the bill and said
            the measure 'meets the challenge of fixing our broken
            immigration system.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several provisions Hatch proposed 'were absolutely
            unacceptable; we tried to find those things that were acceptable
            and to build upon them, and I think we've reached a reasonable
            compromise,' said Illinois Senator Richard Durbin, the
            chamber's second-ranking Democrat and a co-author of the
            immigration proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Senate measure, S.744, seeks to balance a path to
            citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.,
            sought by Democrats, with enough border-security improvements to
            satisfy Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord with Hatch, a Utah Republican, would change the
            formula for calculating the number of visas for foreign
            technology workers while keeping the bill's limit of 180,000 a
            year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Rigorous Standards' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It would lift a requirement that companies look for a U.S.
            worker before hiring a foreign visa holder for all companies
            except those whose workforce is more than 15 percent foreign. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If a firm has more than 15 percent foreign employees,
            there are going to be more rigorous standards in terms of
            recruitment and making these jobs available to Americans,'
            Durbin said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He had pushed for protections for U.S. workers to be
            included. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Durbin, Democratic Senator Charles Schumer of New York and
            other authors of the Senate immigration bill had been courting
            Hatch's vote. Hatch had said he would oppose the measure unless
            Democrats agreed to his amendments favoring technology companies
            that seek to hire more high-skilled foreign workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This took a while,' Schumer told the committee today.
            'It's a compromise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Good Balance' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amendment included Hatch's proposal to require
            employers to show that a U.S. worker wasn't available only when
            they initially hire a foreign employee, not with each visa
            extension. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our amendment strikes a good balance,' Hatch told fellow
            Judiciary Committee members. He said it ensures that 'no U.S.
            worker has been or will be displaced' by a foreign worker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unions led by the AFL-CIO labor federation said technology
            companies are trying to use the H-1B visa program for high-skilled foreign workers to undermine job security
            and
            opportunities for U.S. workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hatch's amendments 'are unambiguous attacks on American
            workers,' AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an e-mailed
            statement. The amendments 'would mean that American
            corporations could fire American workers in order to bring in
            H-1B visa holders at lower wages,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Durbin said he didn't expect an endorsement from labor
            organizations, 'but we at least have worked with them and
            respected their input and have tried to reach an agreement that
            is close to the values they bring to the table.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;100 Amendments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During its deliberations, the Judiciary Committee adopted
            about 100 amendments to the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told
            reporters earlier today he was 'hopeful' the Senate could pass
            immigration legislation, adding that Republican senators share
            'a view the status quo is not good.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McConnell said he would vote to bring the bill to the floor
            so it could be opened up for amendments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Senate bill initially would raise the annual H-1B visa
            limit for high-skilled foreign workers to 135,000 from 85,000.
            Caps in future years could increase to 180,000, depending on
            economic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The measure would require companies to recruit U.S. workers
            before hiring foreign ones. Technology companies say that
            invites bureaucratic scrutiny by the government and lawsuits
            from U.S. workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Other Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hatch has said it will take more than a deal on high-skilled visas to win his backing when the
            measure is considered
            by the full Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For his vote then, Hatch said lawmakers must agree to his
            proposed changes regarding the taxes immigrants must pay and
            social benefits they receive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're going to have to resolve those conflicts for me,
            or I will have to vote against the bill on the floor,' Hatch
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hatch also said he wants to require immigrants who seek
            citizenship to pay additional taxes and to make it clear that
            unauthorized employment can't count toward eligibility for
            Social Security benefits. He is proposing a five-year waiting
            period before those on the path to citizenship could receive
            subsidies under the 2010 health-care law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposals improve the bill's prospects for gaining the
            60 votes needed for Senate passage and also for passing the
            Republican-controlled House, Hatch said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If they do some of the things I think ought to be done,
            then I think it's got a chance,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Durbin said the agreement didn't include Hatch's additional
            requests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He's bargaining for as many things as he can get,'
            Durbin said, referring to Hatch. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Argentine Shale Prospects Seen Boosted by Exxon, Chevron</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina is benefiting from the
            experience of the world's largest oil companies as it develops
            shale deposits in a bid to gain energy independence, said a
            board member of a provincial oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s Argentina unit and provincial-run Gas
            Petroleo del Neuquen SA, or GYP, yesterday reported their
            largest shale discovery in southern Argentina's Vaca Muerta
            formation. The Bajo del Choique X-2 horizontal well is producing
            770 barrels of oil a day in its first flow test, Exxon said in a
            statement. Exxon operates the block and has an 85 percent stake
            while GyP owns the remaining 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are betting on developing the horizontal technology
            along with Exxon because we are convinced that is the way to get
            greater output despite being costly,' said GyP Director Gustavo Nagel in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg
            questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vaca Muerta's oil production more than tripled in the first
            quarter from a year earlier, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg Industries, boosted primarily by a joint venture
            between YPF SA (YPF), Argentina's largest company, and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
            YPF's output from the Loma Campana area in Vaca Muerta rose to
            12,800 barrels a day from 4,200 barrels after investing $1.2
            billion in a pilot year with San Ramon, California-based
            Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Energy Deficit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GyP has partnerships with 18 additional foreign oil
            companies to develop shale in Vaca Muerta, Nagel said. Vaca
            Muerta is a mostly untapped 30,000 square-kilometer (11,600
            square-mile) region, which holds at least 23 billion barrels of
            oil, according to a survey by Ryder Scott. Vaca Muerta has 350
            wells, of which 160 are commercially producing, Nagel said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina will need $300 billion to develop Vaca Muerta
            over a six-year period to make the country energy independent
            starting in 2020 and keep it producing for as many as 40 years,
            Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) Argentine unit President Juan Aranguren
            said on Dec. 10. Argentina posted a record $6.1 billion energy
            deficit last year after 20 years of surpluses through 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shell tripled its investment budget to $500 million this
            year for Vaca Muerta, the world's second-largest shale gas
            formation and the world's fourth-largest shale oil deposit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exxon, Shell and Chevron are the three biggest oil
            companies by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Sommers for Consumer Bank as McInerney Joins Visa</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. lender, named Barry Sommers chief executive officer of its
            consumer bank, replacing Ryan McInerney, who's leaving to become
            president of Visa Inc. (V) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sommers will continue overseeing Chase Wealth Management
            and reporting to Gordon Smith, CEO of consumer and community
            banking, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
            McInerney will be responsible for Foster City, California-based
            Visa's global client organization, product management and new
            solutions group, according to a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon shook up the consumer bank's top
            management two years ago, removing former retail chief Charlie Scharf from his position and ousting former
            mortgage head David
            Lowman after the lender came under fire for abusive foreclosure
            practices, which it spent more than $8.6 billion to settle.
            Scharf left to become CEO of Visa, the world's largest
            electronic-payments network, in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Barry and Ryan have been close partners and friends for
            several years, and we expect a seamless transition as we bring
            these businesses under Barry's leadership,' Smith said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McInerney succeeds John Partridge, who retired as Visa's
            president in March. Partridge, 63, who is staying with the
            company to work on special projects, will receive a base salary
            of $50,000 a month and be paid $562,000 in November as a pro-rated bonus for his work this year as
            president, according to a
            filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McInerney worked at JPMorgan for eight years and was head
            of the consumer bank since 2009, according to JPMorgan's
            statement. Sommers joined Bear Stearns Cos. in 1996 and came to
            JPMorgan when it acquired the firm in 2008, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Sued by Zinc Buyer Over Warehousing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), Glencore PLC (GLEN) and the London Metal Exchange were
            sued by a company that claimed they conspired to restrict zinc
            supplies and drive up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duncan Galvanizing Corp. alleged that in 2010 Goldman
            Sachs, JPMorgan and Glencore each acquired one of the world's
            three biggest metals warehouse operators, giving them control
            over the London Metals Exchange, where 90 percent of zinc metals
            futures are traded, according to a complaint filed today in
            Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duncan, based in Everett, Massachusetts, provides
            protective coatings for steel. It claims the defendants
            conspired to drive up prices by artificially limiting zinc
            supplies. Duncan is seeking to represent a class of purchasers
            of LME-grade zinc for physical delivery in the U.S., from May
            24, 2010, to the present. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, said the firm intends to contest the lawsuit. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York based
            JPMorgan Chase, and
            Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Glencore, based in Baar,
            Switzerland, both declined to comment. Miriam Heywood, a
            spokeswoman for the London Metal Exchange, didn't immediately
            respond to an e-mail sent after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Manhattan courthouse where the zinc suit is filed has
            become a hub of commodities price-fixing claims in recent
            months. Suits have been filed over aluminum warehousing and oil
            futures. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni is overseeing 24
            suits claiming manipulation of the benchmark used to set prices
            in the $18 trillion global gold market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The zinc suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
            tripled under U.S. antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Duncan Galvanizing Corp. v. The London Metal
            Exchange Ltd., 14-cv-03728, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Iron Ore Heads for Record Losing Streak on Growing Supply</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore capped a sixth monthly drop
            in the longest losing run on record as rising supplies from
            Australia and Brazil spur a global glut. Fortescue Metals Group
            Ltd. (FMG) said there could be further losses, with a risk prices may
            retreat to the lowest level since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Tianjin tumbled
            4.1 percent to $91.80 a dry ton, the lowest level in 20 months,
            according to data from The Steel Index Ltd. today. The steel-making raw material sank 12.9 percent in May,
            and has dropped
            every month since December in the longest run of monthly losses
            since the data series began in November 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore entered a bear market in March as the biggest
            miners including BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO) raised
            output, spurring forecasts for a rising global surplus. Slowing
            growth and tight credit conditions in China have restricted the
            expansion of demand in the world's largest user. The price drop
            validates a forecast from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in November
            that the commodity would see a significant decline in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think it is mainly a supply story,' Christian Lelong,
            an analyst at Goldman Sachs in Sydney, said in an e-mail
            yesterday in response to questions from Bloomberg. 'Demand is
            clearly growing at a slower pace, but supply growth is
            particularly strong after years of overinvestment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore may drop to as low as $80 over the next 12 months,
            Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest told a conference in Melbourne
            today. The benchmark tracked by The Steel Index last traded
            below $80 in September 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Forrest's View &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm pretty comfortable with the iron ore price
            oscillating around the $110 mark,' said Forrest, who heads
            Australia's third-largest shipper. 'I think it could wander
            down to $80, it could wander up to $140.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The raw material has lost 32 percent this year compared
            with the 2.8 percent advance for the Standard Poor's GSCI Spot
            Index of 24 commodities and 3.1 percent gain for the MSCI World
            Index of equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rio shares declined as much as 4.4 percent to 3,047.50
            pence in London, the lowest since October. Stock in BHP
            retreated as much as 4.1 percent in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore will average $109 a ton in 2014 and $80 next year,
            Goldman forecasts. So far in 2014, it's averaged $116. The bank
            boosted its estimate for next year's surplus to 175 million tons
            from 145 million tons in a May 20 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The worldwide seaborne surplus will increase to 79 million
            tons this year and 158 million tons in 2015 from last year's 1
            million tons, Morgan Stanley said in a report on May 26. Global
            supplies will expand 10 percent in 2014, outstripping the 3.7
            percent rise in demand, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Chinese Economy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in China, the world's largest
            steelmaker, will grow 7.3 percent this year, according to a
            Bloomberg survey. While that's set to be the least since 1990,
            it's still more than double expected growth in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang said pressures for a downturn are
            'relatively large' and the nation will adjust policy to
            support the economy, according to a statement on May 23.
            Economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. said that Li's comments
            signaled looser borrowing conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Even if the government tries to come up with measures to
            prop up the economy, the problem for iron ore is oversupply,'
            Helen Lau, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd. in Hong Kong, said by
            phone. 'The oversupply issue will outweigh demand recovery.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore prices are unlikely to rise in the next two to
            three months because of increasing supplies from imports, high
            port inventories and a slowdown in steel-product demand, China's
            National Development Reform Commission said on May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stockpiles at Chinese ports climbed 0.7 percent to a record
            113.30 million tons in the week to May 23 from a week earlier,
            according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.
            Inventories have expanded 31 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shipments from Australia and Brazil are expected to grow 28
            percent over the next five years till 2019 to reach 1.3 billion
            tons, data from Australia's Bureau of Resources and Energy
            Economics, or BREE, showed in a quarterly report in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A union representing tugboat deckhands at Australia's Port
            Hedland deferred a strike on May 22 and said it would apply to
            extend the period in which it can take industrial action,
            risking disruption to iron ore shipments from the world's
            largest bulk-export terminal. A second union representing
            tugboat masters at the port approved work stoppages from two to
            72 hours, the Fair Work Commission said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Port Hedland &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Industrial action may hurt exports by miners including
            Fortescue and BHP, which estimated that disruption will cost
            users about $94 million a day. Shipments through Port Hedland
            made up more than a quarter of worldwide seaborne trade last
            year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on figures from
            BREE, with 81 percent of the port's ore going to China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Surging supplies of seaborne ore will challenge producers
            in China, probably forcing some higher-cost capacity in the
            country to close, BHP and Goldman said separately on May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Operating costs at about 80 percent of China's domestic
            iron ore mines are $80 to $90 a ton, according to Xia Yang, a
            Shanghai-based analyst at Mysteel, China's biggest steel
            researcher. That compares with A$39 ($37) for Rio Tinto, A$41
            for BHP and A$56 for Fortescue, UBS AG estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Perth-based Fortescue have tumbled 24 percent in
            Sydney this year. Vale SA (VALE5), the world's biggest iron ore
            exporter, advanced 0.3 percent in Sao Paulo yesterday, trimming
            the drop this year to 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wal-Mart's Ex-Counsel Named CEO of Walton-Supported Vail Clinic</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s former general counsel has joined a sports-medicine clinic and foundation
            supported by a range of wealthy benefactors, including a member of the Walton family and a Wal-Mart
            director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Tom Mars became chief executive officer of the Steadman Clinic and
            the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, according to a statement on the group's website. The Colorado
            clinic, with offices in Vail, Frisco and Edwards, specializes in orthopedic medicine and says it has treated
            hundreds of Olympic and professional athletes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mars left Wal-Mart in March, about two
            months after two members of Congress released e-mails from 2005 in which he informed Mike Duke, now CEO, of
            allegations that executives in Mexico were corrupt. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating Wal-Mart for allegedly bribing Mexican officials to
            speed expansion efforts in that country. Wal-Mart has said it's cooperating with the Justice and SEC
            inquiries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Founded in 1988 by Dr. J. Richard Steadman, the foundation is dedicated to
            'keeping people physically active through orthopedic research and education,' according to its mission
            statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alice Walton, daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton and sister of two
            Wal-Mart board members, has contributed at least $100,000 and up to $500,000 to the institute, according to
            its 2011 annual report and a donor list on the website. Wal-Mart board member Douglas Daft has donated up to
            $100,000 to the institute. Other donors include investment banker Herbert Allen, Michael Dell, the computer
            company founder, and Nelson Peltz, CEO of Trian Fund Management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Leadership Skills'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Tom's executive experience, integrity and leadership skills make him the right person
            to lead both the Steadman Clinic and the Steadman Philippon Research Institute,' Steadman said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His partner, Marc Philippon, said in a statement: 'Tom will be a great fit
            for us. He is an effective communicator with great people skills and will help us achieve our full potential
            for keeping people active.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his statement, Mars said he and his family 'are looking
            forward to living in the Vail Valley and being part of the community.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mars didn't
            respond to a message seeking comment. Wal-Mart and a representative for Alice Walton declined to comment.

        <headline>Mayor Ford Denies Prostitution Allegations, Vows to Sue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Toronto Mayor Rob Ford denied
            allegations he had prostitutes in his office or snorted cocaine
            at a restaurant and said he will pursue legal action against the
            former employees and waiter who made the statements to police. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford is facing new allegations contained in police
            documents released yesterday, including that he brought
            prostitutes to his office, guzzled vodka in his car, made a
            racial slur to a taxi driver and sexually propositioned a female
            staff member. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford, who has already admitted he smoked crack cocaine and
            bought illegal drugs while in office, was responding to
            allegations that were made in police interviews with former Ford
            staff members. None of the allegations have been proven in court
            and police have said there isn't enough evidence to warrant
            charges against the mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford said one of the women named in the police documents
            who came back to his office after a St. Patrick's Day party last
            year wasn't a prostitute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She's a friend, and it makes me sick how people are
            saying this,' Ford told reporters outside his city hall office.
            'I've never had a prostitute here.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He also denied saying he wanted to have oral sex with a
            staff member, who no longer works in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would never do that, I'm happily married.' Ford said.
            'I've got more than enough to eat at home.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Not Perfect' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reporters present reacted with gasps to that statement and
            the mayor's use of a vulgar sexual idiom. Ford later apologized
            for those remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For the past six months, I have been under tremendous,
            tremendous stress,' Ford said at a press conference, which was
            attended by his wife Renata. 'The revelations yesterday of
            cocaine, escorts and prostitution has pushed me over the line
            and I used unforgivable language.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The mayor said today he is receiving 'support from a team
            of health-care professionals.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am taking accountability,' he said, without
            elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier, Ford said he may have driven a car after drinking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I might have had some drinks and driven, which is
            absolutely wrong,' he told reporters. 'I'm not perfect, maybe
            you are, but I'm not.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Personal Issues' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The police documents were released by an Ontario court the
            same day that Ford said for the first time he had bought illegal
            drugs within the past two years. Ford made the statement amid
            questioning at a city hall meeting in which a majority of city
            councilors passed a non-binding motion asking him to take a
            leave of absence to address his 'personal issues.' Ford has
            refused to resign. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of Ford's few remaining allies among city councilors,
            Giorgio Mammoliti, threatened today to withdraw support for the
            mayor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If he doesn't admit that he needs help, then he's lost me
            and I'll be taking a stand with my colleague Councilor Minnan-Wong and asking him to step down completely,'
            Mammoliti said,
            referring to Denzil Minnan-Wong, who backed the council motion
            yesterday for the mayor to take a leave. 'He's got till the end
            of the day.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Don't panic, please city of Toronto, do not panic,
            everything is OK down here,' Mammoliti said in separate
            interview broadcast on CP24 television after Ford's apology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said the things she is
            hearing about Ford are 'truly disturbing,' adding the province
            would consider stepping in to help the city if asked by council.
            Canadian municipalities are governed by provincial laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Provincial Response &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If council were to clearly indicate that they lack the
            ability to function as a result of this matter, the province
            would respond to a request from council to be provided new tools
            depending on what that request might be,' Wynne told reporters
            at the provincial legislature. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Every day he lowers the bar, and this is another one of
            those days,' Minnan-Wong, a former Ford supporter, said to
            reporters. 'I'm very sad for the city and I'm exceedingly angry
            at the mayor. The mayor has got to go.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to two former staff members quoted in the
            documents, women who may have been prostitutes were in Ford's
            city hall office on St. Patrick's Day in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On the same night, Ford called a taxi driver a 'Paki,'
            and made 'mocking fake language sounds,' one of the staff
            members said, according to the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vodka Swig &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In another incident last year, a former staff member told
            police that Ford pulled over his car, drank an 11- or 12-ounce
            bottle of vodka in two minutes and then drove away. Another
            staffer told police she bought Ford a bottle of vodka that size
            twice a week. Iceberg was his preferred brand, according to the
            documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an interview with police, Mark Towhey, Ford's former
            chief of staff, said he believed the mayor was an alcoholic and
            that he had consumed alcohol while at city hall, though he'd
            never seen him drink himself, according to the police documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Towhey was fired after recommending the mayor seek
            treatment, according to the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutor Tom Andreopoulos sent the 500 pages of
            partially redacted police documents to media yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before the latest allegations were released, 30 members of
            the 44-person council in Canada's largest city presented a
            letter asking the mayor to step aside as Toronto's reputation
            has been 'damaged' and it has become difficult to focus on
            city business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Drunken Stupor &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The non-binding motion comes as Ford, 44, vowed to remain
            in office after saying last week he smoked crack likely in one
            of his 'drunken stupors.' Ford, who has been mayor since 2010,
            admitted to using the drug after Toronto police said on Oct. 29
            they had found a video showing him inhaling from a glass crack
            pipe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Ford said he was 'humiliated' by his recent
            actions, he repeated yesterday that he would stay in office and
            run in municipal elections next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is no need for me to take a leave of absence,'
            Ford said in city council. He said he used drugs 'out of sheer
            stupidity' and had been 'inebriated' a number of times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday's motion for Ford to step aside is symbolic
            because there's nothing city council can do to force a sitting
            mayor from office, according to municipal rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford, who was removed from his position as a high school
            football coach this year, wore a Toronto Argonauts jersey when
            he spoke to reporters this morning. That prompted Twitter
            messages from the Canadian Football League team, which plays in
            a semifinal game this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The situation with respect to the mayor and his
            leadership is unseemly at best,' the CFL team posted on Twitter
            today. 'These latest remarks, while wearing our team's jersey,
            are particularly disappointing.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) reported a stake in Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) as Warren Buffett's
            company disclosed its largest new holding since International Business Machines Corp. in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buffett's company owned 40.1 million shares of Exxon on Sept. 30, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire
            said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The world's biggest oil company by market value rose 2.2 percent to
            $95.27 at 4:15 p.m. in New York today, the highest close in at least 33 years. At that price, the holding
            would be worth about $3.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berkshire has benefited this year as its stock picks
            rallied along with the broader market, affirming a strategy of favoring equities instead of bonds amid near
            record-low interest rates. Buffett, 83, has tracked Exxon and bought its stock in the past, holding a stake
            in the Irving, Texas-based energy producer as recently as 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil 'is
            undervalued, in his opinion, and pretty much being ignored by the market,' said David Kass, a professor at
            the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who has taken students to meet Buffett in
            Omaha. 'He knows the company. He knows it well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon had advanced 7.7 percent this
            year through yesterday's close in New York, trailing the 26 percent surge in the Standard Poor's 500 Index.

        <headline>Pixar Cutting Less Than 5% of Jobs After Film Is Delayed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Pixar studio is
            eliminating jobs after deciding to delay next year's theatrical
            release 'The Good Dinosaur.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cuts amount to less than 5 percent of Pixar's 1,200
            employees, according to a person with knowledge of the matter
            who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.
            That's fewer than than 60 positions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are constantly re-evaluating the creative and business
            needs of our studio,' Emeryville, California-based Pixar said
            in a statement, without providing specific numbers. 'With the
            release date change of 'The Good Dinosaur,' we have realigned
            our production and support priorities, which includes a small
            reduction in our staffing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision to delay 'The Good Dinosaur' for 18 months
            left the animation studio that produced 'Toy Story' and
            'Cars' without an annual release for the first time since
            2005. Disney announced the later date in September and said in
            October it would close a Vancouver facility. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Good Dinosaur,' about a 70-foot-tall teenage
            Apatosaurus that befriends a young boy, was pushed back to Nov.
            25, 2015, Disney said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.4 percent to
            $70.20 at 4 p.m. in New York, an all-time closing high. The
            stock has gained 41 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pixar's most-recent release, 'Monsters University,' has
            grossed $743.4 million worldwide since its June debut, according
            to BoxOfficeMojo.com. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wal-Mart Returns to Sam Walton Roots Naming New CEO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is betting on career insider Doug McMillon, who learned the business
            from founder Sam Walton, to revive a company struggling with slowing growth at home and in the international
            regions he oversaw. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's largest retailer yesterday named McMillon, 47, chief
            executive officer, replacing Mike Duke, 63, who retires Feb. 1. An Arkansas native, McMillon has held
            senior-level executive positions in the U.S. and overseas after starting as a worker in a Wal-Mart warehouse
            almost 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the new CEO has struggled to boost growth in China and
            Brazil, his strong knowledge of store operations and consumer behavior may help him improve the U.S.
            business, said Burt Flickinger, managing director at Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm. His
            main challenge at home will be reversing an underinvestment in stores that has resulted in inadequately
            stocked shelves and poor customer service, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He knows how to do it because he
            spent most of his Wal-Mart life in retail operations and buying,' said Flickinger, who noted that Duke
            worked in logistics and distribution before becoming CEO. 'The stores have suffered from a lack of
            investment in people and adequate stocking levels.' &lt;/p&gt;

            1970. Close

        <headline>U.S. CEO Turnover Reaches Highest Level Since 2008</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. corporations are switching chief executive officers at the fastest pace in five years as
            companies from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to Microsoft Corp. grapple with shifting customer tastes, competition
            from upstarts and restive shareholders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, through the third quarter, 43
            companies in the Standard Poor's 500 Index were working under new CEOs, according to executive recruiter
            Spencer Stuart. That suggests 2013 will surpass the 49 of 2011, the biggest for turnover since 2008.
            Wal-Mart joined those ranks yesterday, saying Doug McMillon, head of its international business, will
            replace Mike Duke in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CEOs are required to master a broader range of skills
            than in the past, when top executives might have climbed the ranks with just one discipline. Companies are
            bigger, more global and increasingly complicated, and there's accelerating competition in countries such as
            China, India and Brazil. Executives must also adapt to quicker technological change, including shifts
            brought on by widening use of mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Companies in every industry are dealing
            with a new digital world where sales happen differently, the consumer is reached differently and products
            have to be made and moved around the world in a new way,' said Bob Benson, who heads RL Benson Associates, a
            New Canaan, Connecticut-based consultant to search firms. 'CEOs who don't have a digital orientation are
            worried. We're in a new world.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hannam Shows a Woolly Grasp of Confidentiality, FCA Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, formerly one of JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s top merger advisers, is fighting a proposed
            market-abuse fine with a 'woolly, implicit understanding of
            confidentiality,' lawyers for a U.K. regulator told a court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam is contesting a 450,000 pound ($728,000) civil
            market-abuse fine from the Financial Conduct Authority in a
            London trial that started in July. Hannam was seeking more
            bidders for Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), when he disclosed to an investor
            in 2008 that another potential acquirer had made an offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the information Hannam passed on his client Heritage Oil
            Plc is 'not inside information, what is inside information?'
            Richard Boulton, a lawyer for the FCA, said during closing
            arguments today. If Hannam wins 'it opens the floodgates to the
            selective disclosure of inside information.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, who resigned from the New York-based bank after the
            civil fine, is one of the highest-profile finance workers the
            regulator has sought to fine. Hannam was among the bankers
            advising Xstrata Plc before it was acquired by Glencore
            International Plc. (GLEN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator 'points to the fact that Mr. Hannam held a
            very senior position at his firm and was a role model for
            others,' Hannam's lawyers said in court documents. 'That does
            not mean that it is appropriate to make an example out of him in
            the name of deterrence by imposing a penalty that is not
            warranted in the circumstances.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam's lawyers also contested the size of the fine,
            pointing to the fact it was 'higher than many cases of
            deliberate disclosure' by other dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two e-mail messages form the basis of the FCA's case.
            Hannam, has said the notes were in the 'best interest' of his
            client, Heritage Oil. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Stiller Deflates 'Walter Mitty'; China Violence: Movies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Who would have predicted that the
            rich fantasy world of James Thurber's day-dreaming Walter Mitty
            looks a lot like a second-rate Wes Anderson movie? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Director and star Ben Stiller, nodding to Anderson's
            whimsical indie moods, turns 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'
            into an earthbound reverie, mixing recessionary gloom with
            unconvincing Hollywood uplift. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Depression-era character resurrected for contemporary
            downsizing and media discombobulation, Mitty is a natural fit
            for Stiller, whose best performances, from 'There's Something
            About Mary' to 'Greenberg,' find heart and humor in the put-upon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Here, however, Stiller seems solely interested in heart
            (and cute visual flourishes). The belly laughs that accompanied
            his 2008 'Tropic Thunder' are few. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In screenwriter Steven Conrad's most promising idea, Walter
            is a photo researcher for Life magazine, his job doomed by the
            transition to a leaner online venture -- and by the fact that
            Walter has lost the photo slated for the final issue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As much to impress his just-divorced co-worker Cheryl (a
            subdued Kristen Wiig) as to skirt the ire of his smug, head-chopping new boss Ted (Adam Scott), the usually
            passive Walter
            jets off to far-flung locales from the Himalayas to Iceland in
            search of the picture's globe-trotting photographer (Sean Penn). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Achates Power Inc., a developer of
            efficient internal-combustion engines, raised $35.2 million from
            investors including Sequoia Capital Partners and the venture
            capital arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)'s founding family. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Achates, based in San Diego, will use the money to further
            engine development and continue to expand in regions and
            industries that need fuel-efficient power, Chief Executive
            Officer David Johnson said in an interview. Achates uses opposed
            pistons and cylinders in a design that the company said boosts
            fuel efficiency by 55 percent for gasoline powertrains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The closely held company said it has now secured more than
            $90 million in four rounds. Interest has come from the
            automotive, defense, shipping and power-generation sectors,
            helped by regulatory pressure for increased fuel economy and
            lower emissions, Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think people and industries realize that the technology
            they have today, and what they are developing in their labs for
            tomorrow, isn't enough to meet the mounting challenges,'
            Johnson said. 'And in many cases solutions they have tend to be
            very expensive. That's where we've been able to offer a
            different paradigm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The opposed-piston engines emit 30 percent less nitrogen
            oxide and improve diesel fuel economy by 21 percent, Achates
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Achates is helping develop the next-generation combat
            engine for the U.S. Army. The company doesn't have an engine in
            production yet, Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madrone Capital Partners, the Walton family investment arm,
            has invested in Achates since its founding in 2004, Johnson
            said. Other investors include Sequoia Capital, RockPort Capital
            Partners, InterWest Partners and Triangle Peak Partners, the
            company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong's Independent Commission
            Against Corruption removed all conditions attached to the bail
            of Walter Kwok, the former chairman of Sun Hung Kai Properties
            Ltd. (16), the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The anti-graft agency made the change on Oct. 9, Sun Hung
            Kai said in a filing to Hong Kong's stock exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kwok, a non-executive director of Hong Kong's second-biggest developer by value, was released on
            bail in May 2012,
            after being arrested as part of the probe of his brothers Thomas
            and Raymond Kwok and the city's former No.2 government official,
            Rafael Hui. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raymond and Thomas were granted cash bail of HK$10 million
            ($1.29 million) each last October and Hui's bail was HK$500,000.
            Walter, who is estranged from his younger brothers, had not been
            charged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thomas and Raymond, sons of the developer's late co-founder
            Kwok Tak-seng, took over running Sun Hung Kai in May 2008 after
            ousting their older brother from the chairmanship following a
            court battle. &lt;/p&gt;

            three-year contract with manager Walt Weiss, who guided the team
            to a 10-win improvement during his first season in Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Rockies had a 74-88 record this year, when they
            finished last in the National League's five-team West division.
            They were 64-98 in 2012 and have missed the Major League
            Baseball playoffs the last four seasons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am very excited and grateful to have the opportunity to
            lead this club as we work toward building a championship-level
            team,' said Weiss, who grew up in Tuxedo, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weiss, 49, played 14 major-league seasons at shortstop,
            including with the Rockies from 1994 to 1997, and was the team's
            special assistant to the general manager from 2002 to 2008. The
            Rockies didn't disclose terms of his contract. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China's Stocks Fall Most in 3 Weeks on Economic Concerns</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;China's stocks fell the most in
            three weeks after JPMorgan Chase Co. advised reducing holdings
            and companies linked to Shanghai's free-trade zone tumbled on
            concern valuations are excessive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shanghai International Port (Group) Co. and Shanghai
            Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone Development Co. plunged more than 8
            percent after more than doubling since Aug. 22. Aluminum
            Corporation of China Ltd. and Jiangxi Copper Co., the nation's
            biggest producers of aluminum and copper, led declines for metal
            producers. Poly Real Estate Group Co. fell 2.3 percent, dragging
            a gauge of property developers to its biggest loss since June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) slid 1.8 percent to 2,193.07
            at the close, the biggest loss since Sept. 26. JPMorgan cut
            China to underweight, citing an economic slowdown and potential
            policy disappointment from a Communist Party meeting in
            November. Consumer prices quickened last month, while exports
            unexpectedly fell, according to government reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are increasing worries about the economy,' Li Jun,
            a strategist at Central China Securities Co., said from
            Shanghai. 'We may have reached bottom but we don't see much
            upside in the economic numbers. There are also concerns that the
            meeting in November may not provide much detail and our stocks
            rallied excessively on policy expectations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CSI 300 Index fell 1.9 percent to 2,421.37, with gauges
            of telecom, consumer-discretionary, technology and industrial
            companies losing more than 2 percent. The ChiNext index of small
            companies declined 3.9 percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises
            Index retreated 0.7 percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index
            slid 0.7 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Free Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite has climbed 13 percent from its
            four-year low on June 27, boosted by speculation the city's
            free-trade zone will attract foreign companies and allow for
            financial liberalization. The China Securities Regulatory
            Commission today denied market speculation the zone will
            introduce an international stocks board, saying rules don't
            allow foreign companies to sell shares in the trade area. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shanghai Waigaoqiao declined 9.5 percent to 46.19 yuan,
            paring gains to 211 percent since Aug. 22, when the Commerce
            Ministry said the government approved a trade area in the city.
            Shanghai International Port dropped 8.9 percent to 5.24 yuan,
            trimming a rally since Aug. 22 to 105 percent. The company's
            estimated price-earnings ratio jumped to a three-year high of
            27.3 last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Property Curbs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shanghai, the nation's commercial hub, last month
            inaugurated an 11-square-mile trade zone as a testing ground for
            free-market policies. Companies with the word 'Shanghai' in
            their name have paced the benchmark stock index's rebound from a
            four-year low in June and the rally has spread to shares in
            Tianjin and Qingdao as investors speculated the government will
            let more cities follow Shanghai's plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A measure of developers in the Shanghai index slid 4.2
            percent, the biggest loss among five industry groups. Poly REal
            Estate, the second-largest developer, fell 2.3 percent to 9.61
            yuan. Gemdale Corp. declined 2.6 percent to 5.91 yuan. Shanghai
            Lujiazui Finance Trade Zone Development Co. plunged 10 percent
            to 22.79 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese real-estate stocks were dragged down by concern of
            potential tightening after the Communist Party plenum next
            month, Credit Suisse property analyst Jinsong Du wrote in an e-mailed message. Premier Li Keqiang and
            President Xi Jinping are
            expected to seek support for national plans to reduce the
            government's hand in the economy and financial system at the
            meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Shanghai index trades at 8.7 times projected earnings
            for the next 12 months, compared with the five-year average of
            12.6, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Trading volumes in the
            stocks measure were 1 percent above the 30-day average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government is scheduled to publish third-quarter gross
            domestic product data on Oct. 18. The economy probably expanded
            7.8 percent from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg
            survey, up from the second quarter's 7.5 percent pace. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The most recent rally was from late June,' Adrian Mowat,
            Hong Kong-based equity strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a note
            dated yesterday. 'This cyclical lift appears to be fading
            faster than we hoped.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chalco, as Aluminum Corp. of China is called, slid 4.5
            percent to 4.28 yuan. The company plans to sell its stake in a
            venture in Guinea to a unit of its parent for about $2.07
            billion. Jiangxi Copper slumped 4 percent to 15.48 yuan. Cosco
            Shipping Co. plunged 4.7 percent to 3.62 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senate leaders are resuming talks aimed at avoiding a U.S.
            default and ending the 15-day-old government shutdown after the
            Republican-controlled House scrapped a vote on its plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China, the U.S.'s largest creditor abroad, urged American
            lawmakers opposed to raising the debt limit by tomorrow to get
            out of the way. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. must 'shoulder its responsibility' as the
            world's biggest economy and holder of the main reserve currency
            and 'take concrete measures before Oct. 17 to avoid a
            default,' Deputy Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said at a
            briefing with reporters yesterday in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are also worried about the U.S. debt problem,' Zhang Haidong, strategist at Tebon Securities,
            said in an interview
            from Shanghai. 'If the deal fails, it will impact the global
            economy, including China.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prince Frog International Holdings Ltd. plunged by the most
            on record in Hong Kong after short-seller Glaucus Research Group
            questioned the company's sales and branded the baby-care
            products maker a strong sell. The shares were halted after
            dropping as much as 26 percent to HK$4.66, heading for the
            biggest decline since its July 2011 listing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Credit Swaps in U.S. Reach 2-Week High as Fed Maintains Stimulus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A measure of U.S. company credit
            risk rose to the highest level in two weeks as the Federal
            Reserve said it needs to see more evidence that the economy will
            continue to improve before reducing monetary stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps gauge that investors use to hedge against
            losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased 1.9 basis
            points to 73 basis points at 5:26 p.m. in New York, according to
            prices compiled by Bloomberg. That's the highest level for the
            index since it closed at 73.6 basis points on Oct. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are interpreting the Federal Open Market
            Committee's mention of economic growth since the Fed's bond-buying program began as a signal that the
            central bank may cut
            back stimulus sooner than anticipated, according to Scott MacDonald, head of research at Stamford,
            Connecticut-based MC
            Asset Management Holdings LLC. The FOMC won't reduce the pace of
            purchases until its March 18-19 meeting, according to the median
            estimate of an Oct. 17-18 Bloomberg News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Maybe people are reading that this might indicate the
            FOMC might move sooner than March, but we have a ways to go
            here,' MacDonald said in a telephone interview. The statement
            was 'slightly more hawkish than people anticipated, especially
            considering the downtick in economic data lately.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Evidence' Awaited &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swaps gauge typically rises as investor confidence
            deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
            buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
            less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
            $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal
            retrenchment over the past year, the committee sees the
            improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions
            since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with
            growing underlying strength in the broader economy,' the FOMC
            said in a statement released at 2 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed repeated that it will 'await more evidence that
            progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace' of its
            purchases, which will remain divided between $40 billion a month
            of mortgage bonds and $45 billion in Treasury securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank left unchanged its statement that it will
            probably hold its target interest rate near zero 'at least as
            long as' unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent, so long as the
            outlook for inflation is no higher than 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Procter Gamble &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Procter Gamble Co. (PG), the world's largest consumer-products
            maker, sold $2 billion of bonds in three parts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The maker of Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent issued $1
            billion of three-year notes, split evenly between 0.75 percent,
            fixed-rate debentures to yield 20 basis points more than
            similar-maturity Treasuries and floating-rate debt to yield 8
            basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
            rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $1
            billion of 1.6 percent, five-year debt at a relative yield of 40
            basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds are expected to be rated Aa3 by Moody's Investors
            Service, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The next wave of company defaults isn't likely to reach the
            rate triggered by the financial crisis five years ago, according
            to a report from Moody's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We'll get a longer default cycle, but not as sharp,'
            David Keisman, lead author of the report, said in a telephone
            interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The speculative-grade default rate in the U.S. will be
            'relatively stable' over the next year after ending the third
            quarter at 2.6 percent, according to a Moody's report dated Oct.
            16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Default Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The credit rater forecast a high-yield default rate at
            year-end of 2.7 percent, declining to 2.6 percent by September
            2014, according to the Oct. 16 report. The rates compare with a
            cyclical peak of more than 14 percent in late 2009 and a 20-year
            average of 4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
            Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade
            bonds, increased 8.6 basis points to 354 basis points, Bloomberg
            prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate
            bonds rather than
            similar-maturity Treasuries fell 0.7 basis point to 124.7 basis
            points, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-grade debt is rated Baa3 or higher at Moody's
            and at least BBB- by Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fonterra Cooperative Said to Seek 10% Stake in Australia's Bega</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
            world's largest dairy exporter, is seeking as much as a 10
            percent stake in Australia's Bega Cheese Ltd. (BGA), according to a
            person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. is approaching Bega shareholders
            on behalf of Fonterra and offering A$4.95 per share, said the
            person, asking not to be identified as the information is
            private. Bega, based in New South Wales state, closed today in
            Sydney at A$4.41, giving it a market value of A$670 million
            ($636 million). Its shares have gained 10 percent this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bega, one of three bidders for Warrnambool Cheese Butter
            Factory Co., won Australian regulatory approval today to proceed
            with its A$408 million offer for the dairy producer. Its cash
            and stock offer is below the A$8 per bid offer made last week by
            Montreal-based Saputo Inc. (SAP), which has support from Warrnambool's
            board, and is also lower than a A$7.50 per share cash proposal
            from Murray Goulburn Cooperative Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fonterra, which operates 10 manufacturing sites in
            Australia with 1.7 billion liters of annual milk production,
            this week hired Reunion Capital Partners' Mike Everett to advise
            on 'corporate activity in the dairy sector,' spokesman Carl
            Stephens said Oct. 29. Everett is a former Goldman Sachs head of
            equity capital markets in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Fonterra, Goldman Sachs and Bega declined to
            comment or weren't immediately available. The Australian
            Financial Review reported on Fonterra's stake purchase earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), Japan's largest beverage maker, bought
            a 9.99 percent stake in Warrnambool on Oct. 29. Kirin's
            Australian unit Lion has a contract with Warrnambool to
            manufacture cheese for its Coon and Cracker Barrel brands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bega Cheese holds 18 percent of Warrnambool and Murray
            Goulburn owns 17 percent, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Fall on Stimulus Speculation Amid Earnings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, giving the Standard Poor's 500 Index its first two-day slide in three weeks, on
            speculation the Federal Reserve will scale back stimulus in coming months as investors assessed earnings.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) lost 3.5 percent as the bank-card network said revenue rose less than
            projected. Avon Products Inc. fell 22 percent after saying possible fines related to foreign bribery probes
            may hurt earnings. Facebook Inc. (FB) and Exxon Mobil Corp. jumped more than 0.9 percent after earnings
            topped estimates. Boeing Co. advanced 0.6 percent after saying it would step-up production of its 737 jets.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 dropped 0.4 percent to 1,756.54 at 4 p.m. in New York, after fluctuating
            between gains and losses during the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 73.01 points, or 0.5 percent,
            to 15,545.75. About 7.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 21 percent above the three-month
            average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The market is re-rating expectations to maybe earlier Fed tapering than
            consensus,' Andres Garcia-Amaya, New York-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Chase Co.'s mutual
            funds unit, said in a phone interview today. His firm oversees $400 billion. 'The Fed was a little bit more
            hawkish than people expected, not a lot, but incrementally more hawkish.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Stocks Rise as Economic Data Overshadow Syria Crisis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, following the worst month since May 2012 for the Standard Poor's 500 Index, as
            better-than-forecast economic data overshadowed concern over possible military action against Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CBS Corp. (CBS) jumped 4.7 percent after the broadcaster's programs returned to Time Warner Cable
            Inc. Microsoft Corp. slipped 4.6 percent after agreeing to buy Nokia Oyj's mobile-phone business and license
            its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion). Verizon Communications Inc. dropped 2.9 percent after
            agreeing to buy Vodafone Group Plc's 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            SP 500 climbed 0.4 percent to 1,639.77 at 4 p.m. in New York, paring an earlier advance of as much as 1.1
            percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 23.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 14,833.96. About 6.6
            billion shares changed hands, the highest level since Aug. 1. U.S. exchanges were closed yesterday for the
            Labor Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The economy, things are coming in pretty good,' Karyn Cavanaugh, a
            vice president and market strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management in New York, said in a phone
            interview. Her firm oversees about $190 billion. 'We know there are a lot tensions in the Middle East. If
            you wait for the dust to settle in order to get in the market, you're going to be waiting forever. Look at
            the fundamentals and if the fundamentals are increasing, that's your directional signal.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global
            stocks rose yesterday as data showed China's manufacturing index increased to a 16-month high in August,
            while other gauges showed euro-area factory output expanded at a faster pace than initially estimated in
            August. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Economic Reports &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among today's reports in the U.S., the
            Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index increased to 55.7 in August, the strongest since June
            2011, from 55.4 a month earlier. Readings above 50 indicate growth. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
            survey of economists was 54. Another report showed construction spending in the U.S. increased in July to
            the highest level in four years, propelled by gains in residential real estate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equities
            pared gains after President Barack Obama won endorsement from the two top Republicans in the U.S. House for
            taking action against Syria. Backing from Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor
            will help the president as he makes his case to lawmakers who've questioned the evidence presented by the
            administration that the Syrian government was behind a sarin gas attack last month or whether the U.S. has a
            vital interest in the region. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama urged Congress to take a 'prompt' vote authorizing
            military action. He announced on Aug. 31 that he'd seek support from Congress, after previously saying he
            had authority to order a military mission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fed, Syria &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            benchmark index fell 3.1 percent in August amid concern the Federal Reserve would reduce its monthly bond
            purchases and the U.S. would take military action against Syria. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors in August
            pulled money from exchange-traded funds at the fastest rate since January 2010, with withdrawals reaching
            $17.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from about 1,500 funds. The SPDR SP 500 ETF Trust,
            the largest ETF for American equities, experienced $14 billion in outflows, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better-than-estimated
            corporate earnings and monetary stimulus from the Fed helped the index rally as much as 153 percent from a
            12-year low in 2009, with the gauge reaching a record 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed holds
            a policy meeting on Sept. 17-18 to decide whether to slow the pace of its bond-buying program. Chairman Ben
            S. Bernanke has said that the central bank may reduce its monthly purchases if the employment outlook
            substantially improves and the economy grows in line with forecasts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;100-Day Average
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 failed to stay above its average in the past 100 days after briefly
            surpassing the threshold that's watched by some analysts to gauge the market's trends. The index closed
            below the trend measure for a fifth session, the longest stretch since Nov. 21, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. The average was at 1,640 recently. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Financial, consumer-discretionary and
            health-care shares climbed more than 0.6 percent for the biggest gains among 10 SP 500 industries. Utilities
            and phone companies had the biggest declines, dropping at least 1.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CBS rose
            4.7 percent to $53.50. The broadcaster's programs returned to Time Warner Cable in New York, Los Angeles and
            Dallas after the companies ended a one-month blackout, in time for the start of National Football League
            regular-season games. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cable Agreement &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time Warner Cable agreed to
            pay a significant increase for the right to transmit CBS signals, according to people with knowledge of the
            situation who asked not to be identified because the terms are private. Shares of Time Warner Cable added
            1.8 percent to $109.25. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup (C) Inc. climbed 2.2 percent to $49.37. The
            third-biggest U.S. bank by assets has sold more than $6 billion in private-equity and hedge-fund assets in
            the past month, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the transactions.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. added 0.9 percent to $14.25. The lender confirmed plans to sell
            its remaining stake in China Construction Bank Corp. for a gain of about $750 million before taxes. The
            second-biggest U.S. lender first invested in Construction Bank in 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL)
            Inc. rose 0.3 percent to $488.58, trimming an early rally of as much as 2.8 percent. The world's largest
            technology company said it will hold a Sept. 10 event, when it's projected to announce new iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co. advanced 1.9 percent to $12.72. Hayman Capital Management LP reported a 5.2 percent
            passive stake in the department store chain that is seeking to rebound from its worst sales year in more
            than two decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Increased Takeovers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stocks gained as the U.S.
            market is poised for the busiest month of takeovers since October 2012. More than $130 billion of mergers
            and acquisitions have been announced since the end of August, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jarden Corp. jumped 10 percent to $47.43. The company agreed to buy Yankee Candle for $1.75
            billion, making its biggest acquisition to add the 43-year-old scented candle maker to its collection of
            more than 120 consumer brands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More acquisitions are 'indicative of increased confidence
            in the corporate space in that they view opportunities to take advantage of and feel comfortable using some
            of their capital to do so.' Ethan Anderson, senior portfolio manager at Rehmann Financial in Grand Rapids,
            Michigan, said in a phone interview. His firm oversees about $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft,
            Verizon &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft slid 4.6 percent to $31.88. The maker of the Windows operating system
            will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia's devices and 1.65 billion euros for its patents, according to a
            statement from the companies. Microsoft is deepening a push into hardware as dwindling computer sales sap
            demand for the programs that made it the world's largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia's
            U.S.-traded shares surged 31 percent to $5.12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verizon lost 2.9 percent to $46.01.
            Verizon will get full control of the most profitable U.S. mobile-phone carrier in the biggest acquisition in
            more than a decade. The deal, sought by Verizon since at least 2004, implies a total value for Verizon
            Wireless of almost $290 billion -- larger than the market capitalization of Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), or VIX, fell 2.4 percent to 16.61 today, after a 26
            percent rally in August. Options strategists from JPMorgan Chase Co. to Weeden Co. are predicting that U.S.
            equity volatility will extend its increase in September after posting its biggest monthly advance in more
            than a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;September Volatility &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in an Aug. 29 note
            that volatility is likely to increase in September and October, and recommended buying puts on global stocks
            gauges including the SP 500. Weeden told investors to implement a bearish strategy using October contracts
            on a security tracking the Russell 2000 Index. The VIX has fallen every September in years when volatility
            was below its historical average at the start of the month, data since 1996 compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are a number of catalysts that could drive volatility higher in September such as an
            escalation in the Syrian crisis, further deterioration in emerging markets, or larger-than-expected tapering
            by the Fed,' Mandy Xu, a New York-based equity-derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in an
            Aug. 29 interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Hires Goldman's Robert Kimmel for Energy Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker
            Robert Kimmel as a managing director in the energy group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kimmel will remain in Houston, where he'll be responsible
            for covering oil and gas clients, Jay Horine, head of JPMorgan's
            power and utility group, said last week in an employee memo
            obtained today by Bloomberg. Kimmel, who starts at New York-based JPMorgan in November, became a managing
            director at
            Goldman Sachs at the start of this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Grip Loosened in Dow Average With Visa, Goldman Added</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), whose $186.60 share price and 2.6 percent loss in 2013
            combined to restrain the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than
            any other stock, is about to have its influence diluted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest seller of computer services will see
            its proportion in the gauge cut to 7.9 percent from 9.4 percent
            when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Visa Inc. (V) and Nike Inc. (NKE) are added
            this month. Goldman and Visa, at $165.14 and $184.59, become the
            second- and third-most influential members of the Dow, which is
            weighted according to stock price rather than market value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reducing IBM's influence was part of the rationale for
            picking Goldman, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, and
            Visa, the largest payment network, according to David Blitzer,
            chairman of the SP Dow Jones index committee, which announced
            the actions yesterday. Had they been in the gauge all year, the
            Dow would be up 17.3 percent instead of 15.9 percent, data based
            on yesterday's prices compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's sway over the Dow has been 'reason enough not to
            consider it a good reflection of the stock market,' according
            to Mark Luschini, the Philadelphia-based chief investment
            strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees $58
            billion. 'On certain days I'll walk out, and I'll know to the
            right of the decimal where the SP 500 index closed. But I won't
            know if the Dow Jones industrial average is above 15,000.' &lt;/p&gt;

            IBM has more than doubled since the bull market in U.S. equities began in March 2009, a period in which it

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Hires JPMorgan's Moge for Insurance Investing Post</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Neil Moge from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to lead a London-based
            team
            overseeing investments for insurers amid an expansion of asset
            management in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moge was named executive director and head of insurance
            portfolio management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
            according to a memo last month from Mike Siegel, global head of
            Goldman Sachs's insurance asset management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, and
            No. 1 JPMorgan are among firms vying to manage money for
            insurance companies facing pressure from low bond yields and new
            regulation. New York-based Goldman Sachs manages $133 billion
            for insurance clients, according to June 30 figures on the
            company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Neil will play an integral role as we continue to expand
            our insurance business in Europe and the United Kingdom,'
            Siegel said in the memo. 'Neil has an extensive background in
            investment management for insurance companies.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moge had been an executive director at New York-based
            JPMorgan's global insurance solutions team, where he managed
            client relationships. Prior to joining JPMorgan, he was an
            investment director at RSA Insurance Group Plc and also held
            money-management roles at Axa SA and Prudential Plc's MG
            business, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He will report to John Melvin, chief investment officer of
            the insurance asset management unit, and Iain Lindsay, co-head
            of global fixed income portfolio management. Moge has a
            bachelor's degree in history and a master's in medieval studies
            from the University of Bristol in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's asset management unit in June announced the
            hiring in London of Prashant Sharma from Goldman Sachs as head
            of international fixed-income investments for insurance clients.
            Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
            comment on the departure. She said the company has about $90
            billion in assets under management at the global insurance
            solutions business. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lincoln National Corp. (LNC) hired Chris Giovanni, an analyst from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., as the
            insurer's head of investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He replaces James Sjoreen, who previously announced he
            would retire at the end of this year, Radnor, Pennsylvania-based
            Lincoln said today in a statement. Giovanni, who had a neutral
            rating on Lincoln, will report to Chief Financial Officer Randal Freitag. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lincoln joins larger rivals MetLife Inc. and Prudential
            Financial Inc. in turning to Wall Street for staff to oversee
            relations with investors and analysts. Prudential in June hired
            Mark Finkelstein, an analyst from Evercore Partners Inc. MetLife
            in 2012 hired Edward Spehar from Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Giovanni 'has demonstrated his keen understanding of
            business drivers through his analyst work, and we will benefit
            immediately from his insight,' Freitag said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lincoln also recruited from New York-based Goldman Sachs in
            2012 when it hired Ellen Cooper as chief investment officer. The
            insurer had a portfolio valued at more than $100 billion as of
            June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Giovanni worked for Goldman Sachs since 2006. He most
            recently was a vice president and was the bank's lead analyst
            for life insurers, a coverage group of 17 companies, according
            to today's statement. He has a bachelor's degree from Loyola
            University's Sellinger School of Business Management in
            Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, didn't
            immediately return an e-mail seeking comment after normal
            business hours. &lt;/p&gt;

            East and Northern Africa region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Istanbul has become a hub for sophisticated MA and
            private equity activity in the region as multinational companies
            and private equity firms are attracted to the increasingly
            active leadership role that Turkey plays economically in the
            region,' Ted Cominos, a partner and chairman of Edwards
            Wildman's international private equity practice group said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edwards Wildman will work in collaboration with Ismen
            Gunalcin, formerly known as the Ismen law firm. Ismen Gunalcin
            is a boutique MA and private equity law firm based in Istanbul.
            The firm is led by partners Tolga Ismen and Arzum Gunalcin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our new collaboration with Edwards Wildman presents an
            opportunity for our lawyers to access into a larger network of
            sophisticated clients interested in Turkey while offering access
            to a broad array of international legal services to our existing
            clients,' Ismen said in a statement. 'Our experience in MA,
            private equity transactions and privatizations in Turkey
            complements Edwards Wildman's strong private equity and cross-border practice groups in Turkey and the
            region. We are excited
            to join forces with our new colleagues.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edwards Wildman has more than 600 lawyers at 16 offices in

            &lt;h2&gt;Legal Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lehman Recovery Seen as Justifying $2 Billion Bankruptcy Bill &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harvey Miller, the lawyer guiding Lehman Brothers Holdings
            Inc. through the biggest-ever U.S. bankruptcy, reflected on how
            his client's collapse five years ago went from unthinkable to
            inevitable in an interview near the offices of his law firm, New
            York-based Weil, Gotshal Manges LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lehman's demise 'ignited a worldwide conflagration that
            almost brought down the global financial system,' said Miller,
            who filed the Chapter 11 petition at 2 a.m. on Sept. 15, 2008,
            in New York after the bank failed to win U.S. government aid or
            attract a buyer. 'The consequences were unknown,' Bloomberg
            News' Erik Larson reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five years later, Miller takes credit for helping fend off
            some creditors' liquidation demands and instead turning the
            remains of one of the biggest failures of the financial crisis
            into a going concern. In the process, the Lehman estate has paid
            more than $2 billion in fees and expenses to professionals like
            him for that work, dwarfing the previous record of $757 million
            in Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In exchange for that eye-popping payday, approved by the
            judge in charge of the case, Lehman creditors are poised to get
            18 cents on the dollar by 2016, from an estate valued at $65
            billion, according to a liquidation plan approved in December
            2011. Miller, 80, estimated that recovery may rise to as much as
            22 cents as the value of Lehman's assets increases over the next
            three years to about $80 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His estimate is a 'somewhat educated guess,' Miller said.
            'I am sure debt traders have their own projected recovery
            valuations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lehman, which listed $613 billion in debt when it filed, is
            scheduled to pay out $14 billion to creditors on Oct. 3,
            bringing total distributions to $43 billion since the Chapter 11
            plan was approved, according to court records and Miller. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miller's firm, which also worked on the Enron case, has
            made almost $500 million since the Lehman bankruptcy started,
            and more than $600 million has gone to the restructuring company
            Alvarez Marsal Inc., whose employees ran Lehman after the
            collapse and are still unwinding complex derivatives contracts
            to generate cash for creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-bk-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
            District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Law Firm Management &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Managing Partners Pessimistic About Profit, Not Hiring &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Law firm managing partner confidence levels dipped in the
            third quarter of 2013, according to a survey by the Citi Private
            Bank, which cast the firm leaders as forecasting flat profit
            growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The survey of firm leaders, which included responses from
            48 of the wealthiest 200 American law firms, indicated that the
            firm leaders had diminished expectations for the legal industry
            and the wider economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It validated the revised forecast we made after we
            reviewed the first half-year numbers,' Dan DiPietro, chairman
            of Citi Private Bank's Law Firm Group, said in a telephone
            interview, 'from low single-digit profits to flat.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand expectations for legal work also declined, though
            the managing partners reported an increase in outlook for equity
            partner and associate hiring, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DiPietro said the apparent contradiction could be explained
            by managers looking to hire qualified mid-level associates and
            equity partners who would bring a book of business with them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The survey also showed managing partners as confident about
            managing expenses but concerned about discounted fee requests
            from clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Government Lawyer Joins Goodwin's Securities Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter LLP announced that Derek A. Cohen has
            joined the firm's New York office as a partner in the securities
            litigation and white-collar defense group. Cohen was most
            recently a deputy chief of the fraud section for the Justice
            Department's criminal division and deputy director of the
            Deepwater Horizon Task Force. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Goodwin, Cohen will focus on white-collar criminal
            investigations and prosecutions, regulatory inquiries and
            lawsuits, internal corporate investigations and complex
            commercial litigation, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Derek's extensive experience and accomplishments are a
            welcome addition to our already deep talent pool of white collar
            attorneys,' Richard M. Strassberg, chairman of Goodwin's white-collar crime and government investigations
            group, said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his role on the Deepwater Horizon Task Force, Cohen
            supervised the criminal investigation and prosecutions in
            connection with the April 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to his work at the Justice Department, Cohen was an
            assistant U.S. attorney in Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodwin Procter has 860 lawyers at nine offices in the
            U.S., Hong Kong and London. &lt;/p&gt;

            most recently, with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern
            District of Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his former role, Hamilton led international, national
            and local white-collar criminal investigations and prosecutions
            against individuals and corporations for violations of the
            Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal crimes, including the
            Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, money laundering and
            multidefendant conspiracy cases, the firm said in a statement.
            Among his notable cases, he led the Ohio and Florida-based cases
            of 16 corporate and individual participants in the scrap metal
            industry on criminal price-fixing, bid rigging and other
            charges, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Stringer Repels Spitzer's Comeback in NYC Comptroller Race &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer fought off Eliot Spitzer in the Democratic primary for
            New York City comptroller,
            halting the former governor's attempted comeback from a
            prostitution scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stringer, who had the support of the party establishment
            and the city's three major newspapers, captured 52 percent of
            yesterday's vote with 97 percent of precincts reporting,
            compared with 48 percent for Spitzer, according to the
            Associated Press. With Democrats outnumbering Republicans by
            more than 6 to 1, the victory virtually ensures Stringer, 53,
            will become comptroller after the general election in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The comptroller is the city's chief financial officer,
            auditing agencies and overseeing $140 billion in pension assets.
            Stringer's temperate public statements before his opponent
            entered the race contrasted with the media-driven drama of the
            fiery Spitzer's return. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spitzer, 54, resigned as governor in 2008 after his trysts
            were disclosed. He entered the race in July, upending a contest
            in which Stringer, a career politician, was expected to coast to
            victory. The former 'Sheriff of Wall Street' vowed to use the
            power of the pension funds to keep corporations well managed and
            socially responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He portrayed himself as a ready to do battle with Wall
            Street again, just as he had done as state attorney general. In
            that post, he rose to prominence by exposing conflicts of
            interest between Wall Street firms' analysts and investment
            bankers. Stringer, he said, accomplished little in a 20-year
            career in politics, including 12 in the state Assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As attorney general from 1999 through 2006, Spitzer
            disclosed subpoenaed e-mails and other evidence to persuade
            Merrill Lynch Co., Citigroup Inc. and other securities firms
            to pay $1.4 billion in pretrial settlements, rather than go to
            court on charges they misled consumers with biased research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was then elected governor, with 69 percent of the vote
            in 2006, serving for less than 15 months before getting caught
            patronizing high-priced prostitutes. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>How Wal-Mart's Waltons Maintain Their Billionaire Fortune</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visitors to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, leave appreciative
            notes on a glass wall near the entrance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Thanks Alice!' reads one. 'Merci Alice Walton,
            pour la vision!' reads another. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) heiress Alice Walton founded
            Crystal Bridges in 2011 in a wooded ravine next to her childhood home, supplying dozens of paintings from
            her personal collection. Bankrolled by more than $1 billion in donations from her family, the museum attests
            to the Waltons' generosity and vast wealth. It's also a monument to their skill at preserving that fortune
            across generations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;America's richest family, worth more than $100 billion, has
            exploited a variety of legal loopholes to avoid the estate tax, according to court records and Internal
            Revenue Service filings obtained through public-records requests. The Waltons' example highlights how
            billionaires deftly bypass a tax intended to make sure that the nation's wealthiest contribute their share
            to government rather than perpetuate dynastic wealth, a notion of fairness voiced by supporters of the
            estate tax like Warren Buffett and William Gates Sr. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estate and gift taxes raised only
            about $14 billion last year. That's about 1 percent of the $1.2 trillion passed down in America each year,
            mostly by the very rich, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers estimated in a December blog post on
            Reuters.com. The contrast suggests 'our estate tax system is broken,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Unbelievable'
            Savings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alice Walton's mother and brother poured more than $9 billion into trusts since
            2003 that fund charitable projects like Crystal Bridges and are also designed to protect gifts to heirs from
            taxation. Another Walton pioneered a tax-avoidance maneuver that is now widely used by U.S. billionaires.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I hate to say it, but the very rich pay very little in gift and estate tax,' said
            Jerome Hesch, a lawyer at Berger Singerman LLP in Miami who reviewed some of the Walton family's trust
            filings for Bloomberg. 'At the Waltons' numbers, the savings are unbelievable.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A family
            spokesman, Lance Morgan, said in a statement that 'any charitable or estate planning practices employed by
            the Walton family are broadly available and commonly used.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan represents the branch
            of the family that includes Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton's three surviving children and eight grandchildren.
            Their Wal-Mart stake is worth enough to fill a large backyard swimming pool with solid gold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Amassing
            Billions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spurred by historically low interest rates that magnify the tax savings, the
            richest Americans have amassed at least $20 billion in trusts like those used by the Waltons. They include
            Elaine Marshall, the Koch Industries Inc. director, and Fidelity mutual funds' Johnson family. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 40 percent tax is levied at death on estates of more than $5.25 million for an individual or
            $10.5 million for a couple. Total lifetime giving to heirs that exceeds those thresholds is also taxed at 40
            percent, preventing people from avoiding the estate tax through early handouts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Closing
            just two estate tax loopholes -- ones that the Waltons appear to have used -- would raise more than $2
            billion annually over the next decade, according to Treasury Department estimates. That doesn't count taxes
            lost to the type of charitable trusts the Waltons used to fund projects like the museum; the department
            hasn't estimated that cost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'More Unfair' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a sign of just how
            much money is at stake, the IRS is trying to collect as much as $2.8 billion from the estate of the Michigan
            industrialist William M. Davidson, according to a petition filed by Davidson's family in U.S. Tax Court in
            June. The IRS is challenging the validity of some of Davidson's maneuvers, which were different from the
            ones the Waltons use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The whole tax structure since I came to Congress actually has
            gotten more and more unfair,' said James McDermott, a Washington Democrat who's been in the House since 1989
            and has sponsored unsuccessful bills to close estate-tax loopholes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Artful Dodgers: From
            Hedge Fund Managers to Retail Magnates to Superstar Athletes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guarding the Waltons' wealth
            as it passes from one generation to the next is the task of a handful of staffers laboring in an unmarked
            suite in Bentonville, above a bike shop called Phat Tire. Walton Enterprises LLC manages the world's biggest
            fortune in a nondescript office that even employees of the coffee shop next door have never heard of. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The family's estate-planning efforts are well shielded from public view. The wills of Alice's
            parents, Sam and Helen, on file in an Arkansas probate court, reveal little about their financial
            arrangements. That of her brother John, who died in 2005, was sealed by a Wyoming judge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Waltons'
            Model &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, professional planners have sometimes held up the Waltons as a model.
            Patriarch Sam Walton, who founded Wal-Mart in Bentonville, cultivated an image as a regular guy from
            Oklahoma who enjoyed quail hunting and drove a beat-up Ford pick-up truck. He also showed unusual foresight
            about estate planning. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Why Bitcoins and Apple Pay Can't Kill Off Cash</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cash is dirty and flimsy. It comes with no official rebate or reward programs. Worst of all, you
            can't stuff it into a smartphone or laptop to pay for something online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are no
            real substitutes for cold hard cash. Despite predictions of a cashless society, the Bureau of Engraving and
            Printing and the U.S. Mint churn out more currency and coins every year. The average American still uses
            cash for dozens of transaction each month, despite the wealth of alternatives, from good old plastic to
            virtual currencies to 'point and pay' apps like the upcoming Apple Pay service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cash has
            advantages these high-tech replacements can't match. It won't run out of battery power, for one thing. It's
            anonymous -- invisible to the IRS, law enforcement and hackers, as well as to irritating marketers and data
            brokers. As Cass Sunstein notes, paying only in cash can also be a great way to monitor spending and stick
            to a budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average person pays with cash about 23 times a month, according to an
            analysis by the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. While credit card use has doubled since 2000 and debit
            card use is up fivefold, cash is still used more often than either option. It's most often used for
            transactions under $25, even by those who claim to prefer credit or debit cards overall. And 40 percent of
            18- to 24-year-olds say cash is their preferred form of payment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some $1.2 trillion in
            cash circulates outside of banks -- 15,000 tons worth. That's up 20 percent since 2011, and is the
            equivalent of $3,836 squeezed under the mattresses of every U.S. man, woman and child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            location of all these "Benjamins" -- it's mostly in $100 bills -- is a puzzle to economists and currency
            experts. When asked how much money they kept in their wallet or house, the average U.S. respondent said a
            little more than $40 in the wallet and $100 in the house, according to a 2013 Tufts University study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some
            of the money may be overseas. Less than a quarter of U.S. currency resides abroad, estimates University of
            Wisconsin economist Edgar Feige. Where's the rest? Legitimate business owners and those without bank
            accounts rely heavily on cash. And some is hidden away by the real-life equivalents of Breaking Bad's Walter
            White in an underground 'cash only' economy. The U.S. may lose more than $100 billion a year in taxes on
            unreported income of over $400 billion, according to the Tufts study and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using
            cash can help people carefully track their own spending, as Sunstein says. But one of its most convenient
            features is that it keeps everyone else in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More stories by Ben Steverman:&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Picks Stocks Over Debt as Goldman Upbeat: Korea Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;South Korean stocks are beating
            bonds by the most in six quarters as foreign investors buy
            shares at the fastest pace on record and accelerating global
            economic growth increases the chances of monetary tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Kospi (KOSPI) index has added 7 percent since the end of June,
            compared with a gain of less than 0.1 percent in Bank of America
            Corp.'s index tracking the nation's sovereign debt, the biggest
            gap since the first quarter of 2012. While overseas money
            managers withdrew $1.9 billion from debt in August, equities
            lured inflows in the past five weeks, including a record $3.6
            billion last week. The Kospi is valued at 1.1 times net assets,
            a 47 percent discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say
            shares will keep outperforming bonds as the fastest export
            growth in seven months boosts profit at Kospi companies, which
            get about 40 percent of their sales overseas. Economists
            surveyed by Bloomberg predict the Federal Reserve will announce
            a reduction in its bond-purchase program on Sept. 18, while
            Goldman Sachs says the Bank of Korea will increase interest
            rates in the second half of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We bought more Korean stocks in August,' Grace Tam, a
            Hong Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset,
            which manages about $1.5 trillion, said in a telephone interview
            on Sept. 11. 'Rotation from bonds to equities will go on.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;International investors have poured a net $7.2 billion into
            South Korean shares in the past five weeks as data showed the
            economy expanded 1.1 percent in the three months through June
            from the previous quarter, while exports jumped at a quicker-than-estimated 7.7 percent rate in August.
            Foreigners bought a
            net $165.4 million worth of Kospi shares as of 10:37 a.m. in
            Seoul today, extending net purchases to 17 consecutive days. The
            benchmark Kospi index added 0.9 percent to 2011.96. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Samsung Inflows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world's biggest smartphone
            maker, attracted $2.05 billion of inflows during the period and
            SK Hynix Inc. (000660), the second-largest computer-memory chipmaker,
            lured $573 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Kospi advanced 2 percent last week to 1,994.32,
            extending its rally from an 11-month low on June 25 to 12
            percent. The Bank of America bond index returned 0.8 percent
            last week and its yield slipped to 3.19 percent, within 0.01
            percentage point of the lowest level since July 24. The won
            strengthened 0.6 percent to 1,086.88 per dollar, paring this
            year's drop to 2.1 percent. The cost of protecting the nation's
            debt against nonpayment using credit default swaps rose to 75
            basis points from 73.5, according to CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Profit Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The benchmark equity index will probably climb to as high
            as 2,200 by the middle of next year, a 10 percent gain from its
            closing level on Sept. 13, according to Kwon Goohoon, a Seoul-based economist for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
            amortization at Kospi index companies will probably climb 15
            percent in the next 12 months, versus 10 percent for the MSCI
            All-Country index, according analyst estimates compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Corporate earnings will see better growth, most likely
            from the fourth quarter, as global economies including Korea are
            turning around,' Kwon said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reduced stimulus by the Fed will weigh on most emerging-market assets, including South Korean
            equities, Vivek Misra, a
            Bangalore-based Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale SA,
            said in a telephone interview on Sept. 13. The Kospi may end the
            year at 1,900, about 5 percent below the closing level last
            week, before rallying in 2014, Misra said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fed Taper &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank will cut monthly Treasury purchases
            to $35 billion from $45 billion while maintaining mortgage-bond
            buying at $40 billion, according to the median of 34 responses
            in a Bloomberg News survey of economists on Sept. 6. That pace
            was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was a projection that
            the program will end in June. The Kospi has rallied 106 percent
            since the Fed's first round of bond-buying in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gains in South Korean stocks this quarter have reduced
            dividend yields on the Kospi to the lowest levels since April
            2012 compared with the yield on debt, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. The equity gauge has a payout of 1.17 percent,
            versus the 3.57 percent yield on the nation's 10-year government
            bonds. The gap of 2.4 percent compares with the 16-month low of
            2.5 percent on Aug. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors will continue favoring equities over bonds as
            interest rates rise, said Kim Jiun, a Seoul-based analyst at
            Shinhan Investment Corp. The foreign withdrawals from debt in
            August were the first in seven months, according to the
            Financial Supervisory Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BlackRock Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Bank of Korea held its key interest rate at 2.5
            percent for a fourth straight month last week, Goldman Sachs
            estimates the central bank will increase the rate to 3 percent
            by the end of 2014. The economy will expand 2.8 percent in 2013
            and 4 percent next year, which would be the fastest pace since
            2010, according to central bank forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been holding a conservative view on the bond
            market and have moved to bonds with shorter maturity,' Kim Ki
            Hyun, head of the fixed-income investment division at Woori
            Asset Management Co., said by phone from Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quicker global growth is boosting the sales outlook for
            South Korean companies, according to BlackRock Inc., the world's
            largest money manager. Service industries in the U.S. expanded
            in August at the fastest pace in almost eight years as a pickup
            in demand encouraged companies to increase hiring, the Institute
            for Supply Management said on Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Korean exporters are benefiting from global growth,'
            Marc Desmidt, the head of alpha strategies for Asia Pacific at
            BlackRock, which oversees about $3.8 trillion, said in a Sept.
            11 interview on Bloomberg Television. 'If that continues that
            will be very good for them.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Banks in Commodities Revenue Followed by Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, generated the most revenue from commodities
            out of the 10 biggest investment banks in the first six months
            this year, according to Coalition, an analytics company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ranked second and Morgan Stanley (MS)
            was third, Coalition, based in London, said in a report today.
            For all of last year, Goldman had the most revenue from
            commodities, followed by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. Figures
            for individual banks weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodity prices dropped 5.5 percent in the first half as
            Chinese growth slowed and supply surpluses emerged. JPMorgan
            said in July that it plans to get out of the business of owning
            and trading physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue from raw materials fell 20 percent in the first
            half to $2.7 billion and dropped 24 percent for all of last
            year, to $6 billion, Coalition said. Last year's total was less
            than half the level in 2008, when oil climbed to a record.
            Spokesmen for JPMorgan, Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to
            comment about their commodity rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said
            this year that he's open to different structures in his bank's
            commodities unit. The firm held talks last year with Qatar's
            sovereign-wealth fund about selling a stake in the business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's physical commodities unit is a 'core'
            business that provides a crucial service to clients, Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the largest investment bank by revenue in the
            first six months this year and also ranked first for fixed
            income, currencies and commodities as a group, Coalition said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China's Stocks Rise Most in Seven Weeks; Brokerages Climb</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;China's stocks rose, sending the
            benchmark index to its biggest gain in about seven weeks, as a
            jump in new trading accounts lifted brokerages and defense
            companies rallied on speculation of increased state spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citic Securities Co. climbed 3.4 percent and Changjiang
            Securities Co. (000783) advanced by the 10 percent daily limit. Jiangxi
            Hongdu Aviation Industry Co. surged 10 percent. President Xi
            Jinping called on the People's Liberation Army to boost their
            combat readiness, according to a Xinhua News Agency report on
            Sept. 22. China Coal Energy Co. rallied 3.8 percent in Hong
            Kong, leading energy shares higher. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) advanced 1.5 percent to
            2,343.58, its highest close since March 2013. Investors opened
            about 217,000 accounts last week, the most in two years, amid
            speculation an exchange link with Hong Kong and government
            stimulus will boost stocks. The 30-day average value of shares
            traded in Shanghai rose to the highest level since April 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are still positive on China,' Daphne Roth, head of
            Asian equity research at ABN Amro Private Banking, which manages
            about $218 billion, said by phone from Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index increased 1.4 percent
            from a two-month low in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Index added
            0.35 percent. The CSI 300 Index of China's biggest companies
            advanced 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Valuations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite has gained 11 percent this year and
            trades at 8.5 times projected 12-months earnings, while the Hang
            Seng China Enterprises (HSCEI) has declined 0.9 percent and is valued at
            6.8 times. The Hang Seng China AH Premium index climbed to 96.81
            yesterday, its highest level since May 13, signaling a narrowing
            gap between dual-listed stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The exchange link with Hong Kong is set to start next month
            and allows a net 23.5 billion yuan ($3.8 billion) of daily
            cross-border purchases. China is counting on the link's success
            to help liberalize its financial system, increase the role of
            the yuan and give its citizens more investment channels amid a
            slumping property market and increased risks from local wealth-management products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are strong expectations for reforms as we approach
            the start of Shanghai-Hong Kong link,' said Mao Sheng, an
            analyst at Huaxi Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A gauge of financial stocks on the CSI 300 rallied 2.2
            percent, the most since Aug. 4. Brokerages accounted for all 10
            of the biggest movers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citic Securities closed at its highest level since Sept. 5,
            while Changjiang Securities climbed to its highest since March
            2011. The number of funded accounts increased by about 158,000
            last week, the most since February, after falling to the lowest
            level since 2010 the previous week, according to official
            securities data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;PLA Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among defense-related companies, Jiangxi Hongdu Aviation
            extended its advance this year to 59 percent. Hafei Aviation
            Industry Co. climbed 8.1 percent today. AVIC Aircraft Co. shares
            were suspended pending an announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The PLA chiefs of staff met in Beijing on Sept. 21 to
            discuss how to improve the efficiency of military command,
            Xinhua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Energy Index climbed 1.9 percent, the
            biggest gain among the broader gauge's 10 industry groups and
            paring this month's rout to 7.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Coal Energy, the second-largest listed mainland
            producer of the commodity, rose the most in three weeks. Yanzhou
            Coal Mining Co. advanced 2.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China, both the world's biggest market for coal and worst
            carbon-dioxide emitter, is seeking to reduce output at the
            nation's 14 largest producers after prices slumped amid efforts
            to moderate economic growth and fight pollution. More than 70
            percent of miners are unprofitable and half are delaying or
            cutting wage payments, according to the China Coal Industry
            Association. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're probably seeing a technical rebound triggered by
            speculation the government will come with measures to help coal
            producers,' said Ben Kwong, a director at KGI Asia Ltd. said.
            'There's recent news the government will restrict coal output
            and imports. That should help reduce stockpiling problems.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rambus, Pfizer, Disney, Couristan: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc. (RMBS), a designer of high-speed memory chips, won an appeals court ruling yesterday
            that
            forces the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to reconsider the
            validity of one of its patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
            Washington said the agency erred in its analysis of whether the
            patent was an obvious variation of earlier know-how and remanded
            the case for further review. The court did uphold part of the
            patent office decision. The opinion was posted on the court's
            website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patent at issue -- 6,260,097 -- was issued in July 2001
            and was at issue in a patent dispute between Rambus and Nvidia
            Corp. (NVDA) of Santa Clara, California. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Complaint Triggers Raid on Fake Viagra in Philippines &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), maker of the erectile-dysfunction drug Viagra,
            filed a trademark complaint that resulted in the seizure of 1
            million Philippine pesos ($23,028) worth of fake Viagra pills,
            the Philippines' Freeman newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After making a test buy, the country's National Bureau of
            Investigation arrested a Chinese citizen in connection with the
            sale of the fakes, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to the fake Viagra, law enforcement officials
            found boxes of a fake version of another manufacturer's drug
            used to treat erectile problems, according to the Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer consultant Maximo Ocampo told the newspaper that the
            product was being sold by street vendors who were getting their
            stocks from the Chinese citizen, the Freeman reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;University of Alabama Calls Foul on Houndstooth Mafia &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The University of Alabama filed a trademark infringement
            lawsuit against an Alabama company that creates goods for fans
            of the school's football team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed Sept. 19 in federal court in
            Alabama, the school accused Houndstooth Mafia Enterprises LLC of
            infringing the university's trademarks associated with its
            former football coach, the late Paul 'Bear' Bryant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bryant, who coached the team from 1958 to 1982, was known
            for wearing a fedora in a houndstooth-patterned fabric. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Houndstooth Mafia, of Smiths Station, Alabama, sells
            clothing that is similar to products sold by the university and
            is likely to confuse potential buyers into thinking it has the
            school's endorsement, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The school also objects to a website operated by the
            company and to Houndstooth Mafia's application to register the
            term as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The school was unsuccessful in opposing the application. On
            July 23 an appeals board at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
            found that the school failed to show that the mark 'closely
            approximates the identity or persona of either Coach Bryant or
            the university.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board said the mark doesn't falsely suggest a
            connection with the school and isn't disparaging. The board
            dismissed the opposition with prejudice, which means that the
            school isn't free to re-file it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the suit, the school asked the court to order the patent
            office not to register the mark, and to vacate the board's
            opinion. Additionally, the school wants the court to to bar the
            company's use of the term 'Houndstooth Mafia,' and to order a
            recall of all allegedly infringing merchandise. The school asked
            for damages, the company's profits attributable to the alleged
            infringement, and attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The school is known for aggressive protection of its
            intellectual property rights. Last September, it backed down
            from its pursuit of a local bakery for selling cakes and cookies
            featuring a red letter A. The school also engaged in lengthy
            litigation with the artist who designed the U.S. postage stamp
            honoring Bryant, objecting to the artist's refusal to take a
            license to make commercial prints of images he made of the team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new case is Board of Trustees of the University of
            Alabama v. Houndstooth Mafia Enterprises, 7:13-cv-01736, U.S.
            District Court, Northern District of Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Disney Sues Pennsylvania Theater Company Over Live Performances &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Disney Enterprises unit sued a theater
            company in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed yesterday in federal court in Allentown,
            Pennsylvania, accused Entertainment Theatre Group of presenting
            a stage production -- 'Broadway: Now Forever' -- that
            infringes the company's copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Entertainment Theatre Group,
            which does business as American Music theater, is using content
            from 'Mary Poppins,' 'The Lion King' and 'Spider-Man'
            without authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disney said in the complaint that American Music Theatre
            advertises its 'Broadway: Now Forever' show as a re-creation
            of 'the greatest moments ever on stage.' Disney says the show
            uses its trademarks, artwork, songs and other properties
            deliberately and without permission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based film company asked the court
            to bar further infringement of its copyrights and to award at
            least $1.65 million in damages, plus attorney fees and
            litigation costs. Disney also seeks additional damages for what
            it says is trademark infringement and asked that the amount be
            tripled to punish the theater company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Entertainment Theatre Group didn't respond immediately to
            an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v. Entertainment
            Theatre Group, 13-cv-05570, U.S. District Court, Eastern
            District of Pennsylvania (Allentown). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Couristan Takes Issue With Rug-Pattern Camouflage Costumes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Couristan Inc., a rug manufacturer based in Fort Lee, New
            Jersey, sent a cease-and-desist letter to two participants at a
            conference where attendees wear science-fiction, superhero and
            fantasy costumes, the Daily Dot reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rug company objected to costumes worn by two attendees
            that matched the carpeting at the Atlanta Marriott Hotel where
            the DragonCon event was held, according to the Daily Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The carpet-pattern camouflage costume was so popular with
            conference attendees that the designer -- Atlanta-based Volpin
            Props -- began offering similar costumes for sale and promoting
            them on its Facebook Inc. (FB) social media page, the Daily Dot
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Volpin Props commented on Couristan's position that the
            costumes infringed in a statement on the Facebook page, saying
            that 'the absurdity is palpable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Burmese Artists Say Unauthorized Work Hangs in Innwa Bank Lobby &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eight Burmese artists are seeking compensation from a bank
            in that nation's city of Yangon over what they say is
            unauthorized use of a painting they jointly created, Myanmar's
            Eleven Media Group reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The artists said they were hired to create a landscape
            painting to be placed in the departure lounge of the Yangon
            airport, according to Eleven Media Group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The artists claim their painting was reproduced on vinyl
            with a quarter of it cut out, and then hung in the lobby of the
            Innwa Bank, Eleven Media Group reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The administrative manager of the bank told Eleven Media
            Group that the bank is willing to negotiate with the artists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Indian Director Wins Dismissal of 'Fashion' Copyright Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bollywood director Madhur Bhandarkar persuaded a Mumbai
            court to dismiss a copyright lawsuit brought over his film
            'Fashion,' the Indian Express reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was accused of infringing the copyright to a book
            written by Seema Seth, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to Bhandarkar, Seth sued the film's writer and
            UTV Motion Pictures Plc, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although given almost a year after the filing of the
            initial complaint to present evidence of the infringement, Seth
            failed to appear in court, according to the Express. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Denmark to Devote More Resources to Criminal Copyright Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denmark has begun a two-pronged attack on copyright
            violators, the Copenhagen Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under a plan developed by the public prosecutor's office,
            the Statsadvokaten for Saerlig Okonomisk of International
            Kriminalitet, Denmark's so-called 'fraud squad' would be
            delegated to handle a 'substantial number' of the criminal
            copyright cases, according to the Post. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On the local level, each police district will have one
            officer designated as the contact point for copyright-related
            crimes, and the fraud squad will be available to local police
            departments when needed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marie Fredenslund, head of Rettighedsalliancen, an
            association of copyright owners, hailed the changes and told the
            newspaper that that a year ago, when content owners contacted
            law enforcement about copyright crimes, 'they wouldn't have any
            idea what we were talking about.' &lt;/p&gt;
