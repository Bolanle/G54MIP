        <headline>Lenovo-IBM Deal Probed by U.S. Over Servers at Pentagon</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (LNVGY) must convince
            government officials that buying a server unit from
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) won't give China back-door
            access to U.S. secrets and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The wrinkle is that the Pentagon, the FBI and the nation's
            biggest telecommunications companies buy the IBM servers,
            according to people familiar with the matter and an analysis by
            Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Use of the servers by the government, telephone networks
            and other potentially sensitive customers will spark close
            scrutiny from the interagency group known as the Committee on
            Foreign Investment in the U.S., which investigates national-security risks of foreign acquisitions of
            domestic companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's kind of the perfect storm of issues,' said Anne
            Salladin, a former Treasury Department official who worked on
            CFIUS reviews and is now at Stroock Stroock Lavan LLP in
            Washington. 'Any foreign acquirer with this kind of asset
            purchase is very likely to be something that CFIUS would want to
            take a look at.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beijing-based Lenovo (992), which announced the $2.3 billion IBM
            purchase Jan. 23, has formally sought approval for the deal from
            CFIUS, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
            Acquisitions of U.S. businesses by Chinese buyers are rising,
            increasing tension in Washington over Chinese access to U.S.
            technology. CFIUS reviews can take as many as 75 days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Briefing Officials &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo fell 1 percent to close at HK$8.91 in Hong Kong. The
            stock has lost 5.5 percent this year after advancing 34 percent
            in 2013. IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $191.77 at the
            close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo, which bought IBM's personal computer business in
            2005, has been briefing officials on the deal, pointing out that
            it won't have access to the servers because IBM will continue
            maintenance on the equipment, according to a person familiar
            with the matter. That agreement lasts for five years and could
            be extended, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The service agreement may help ease the security review by
            CFIUS, which examined more than double the number of
            transactions by Chinese investors in 2012 than it did the
            previous year, making them the most scrutinized foreign buyers
            of American assets ahead of the U.K., according to the
            committee's most recent report to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Breakup Fee &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government is going to take a look at the degree of
            penetration of'the servers, where they are, how old they are,
            what'the'reach-back capability might be,' Mario Mancuso, an
            attorney at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver Jacobson LLP.
            'Could they use the servers as a means of insertion'into U.S.
            government networks and'data systems?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo agreed to pay a fee that's more than double the
            typical size should it fail to aquire IBM's low-end server unit,
            people familiar with the matter said in January. The breakup
            charge of about $200 million, according to one of the people,
            highlights the risk the Chinese company has chosen to bear for
            its largest-ever purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. officials will also examine any use of the servers in
            critical infrastructure, such as chemical plants and electric-utility companies, Michael Wessel, a member of
            the U.S.-China
            Economic and Security Review Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Exfiltration and infiltration are the issues,' Wessel
            said. 'Can they get access to servers in some way and take data
            out or can they infiltrate the system to put in trap doors,
            viruses, malware or be able to take down systems in a potential
            conflict situation?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Contract Data &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Bloomberg Industries analysis of federal contract data
            shows government purchasers of IBM BladeCenter servers include
            the Pentagon, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chris Padilla, the company's vice president for
            governmental programs, told Bloomberg in January that IBM
            servers are used by the U.S. government, without identifying
            which agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Damien Pickart, a spokesman
            for the Pentagon, acknowledged that the Lenovo-IBM transaction
            is pending before CFIUS and added that the Defense Department,
            which is a member of the committee, would be involved in the
            deliberations. He declined to comment further and referred
            questions to Treasury, which chairs the committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Telephone Networks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holly Shulman, a CFIUS spokeswoman, declined to comment.
            Spokesmen for the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security
            didn't respond to requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The servers are also embedded in telephone networks
            operated by ATT Inc. (T), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Sprint
            Corp., according to three people familiar with the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM spokeswoman Deirdre Murphy Ramsey declined to comment
            on the Armonk, New York-based company's clients. IBM is prepared
            for a 'comprehensive review' by CFIUS and is 'confident of a
            positive outcome,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mark Siegel, an ATT spokesman, Richard Young, a Verizon
            spokesman, and John Taylor, a Sprint spokesman, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and the Obama administration have tried to
            prevent China's Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from doing
            business in the U.S. A 2012 report by the House Intelligence
            Committee cited security threats posed by Chinese
            telecommunications companies and urged the government to block
            transactions by Huawei and ZTE. The companies provide 'a wealth
            of opportunities' for Chinese intelligence agencies to insert
            malicious hardware or software into U.S. telecommunications
            networks, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Deep Concerns' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Then U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke expressed 'deep
            concerns' to Sprint in 2010 that Huawei might win a contract to
            upgrade the mobile-phone carrier's network. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anything now with China gets attention,' said James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Center for
            Strategic and
            International Studies. 'But Lenovo, because it's not a state-owned enterprise and because they've done deals
            successfully in
            the past, they're really well placed to get through.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo would get IBM servers that use x86 processors, an
            industry-standard technology. The transaction includes
            BladeCenter and Flex System blade-style servers -- slim devices
            that slide into racks -- along with switches that run corporate
            computer networks. IBM will keep its System z mainframes, Power
            servers and other higher-end hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Working Cooperatively &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo is working cooperatively with CFIUS to win
            clearance, spokesman Brion Tingler said in a statement. The
            company has had three previous acquisitions cleared by the
            committee, including the 2005 IBM deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the companies say they expect to win clearance from
            CFIUS, Lenovo will probably have to agree to restrictions on the
            business, according to lawyers who advise companies on deals
            that require U.S. security review. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those agreements can include requirements that only U.S.
            citizens handle certain services, independent audits, guidelines
            for handling government contracts, and termination of certain
            business activities, according to CFIUS's most recent report to
            Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is not just some Chinese company you've never heard
            of,' said Stephen Paul Mahinka, a lawyer at Morgan, Lewis
            Bockius LLP. 'There are ways in which you can protect U.S.
            interests while at the same time not preventing the
            acquisition.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While servers can store large collections of sensitive
            data, the risks associated with them are about the same as that
            from laptops and smartphones, which consume the same data and
            have access to the servers, said Michael Belton, a security
            expert at cybersecurity company Rapid7. Once installed in a
            network, servers are also more heavily defended and monitored,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There isn't a large difference between a server and a
            laptop,' Belton said. 'Modern laptops can and do store as much
            sensitive data as a server.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Augusta National Stays Mum on When IBM's Female CEO Can Join</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) will sponsor Augusta National Golf Club's Masters
            tournament for the 12th straight year later this week, even as
            Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty waits for a public
            invitation to join the formerly all-male organization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Augusta National has historically invited IBM's CEOs to
            join its ranks, though not necessarily when they first take the
            job. Rometty, who became the company's first female chief in
            2012, found herself at the center of a controversy last year
            over the club's exclusion of women. Under pressure to change its
            rules, the club invited two women to join after the last
            tournament was held. Rometty, 55, wasn't among them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rometty, whose company has sponsored the Masters since
            2002, will probably receive an invite eventually, said Hayes Roth, chief marketing officer for Landor
            Associates, a global
            branding and design firm. Still, Augusta National may not be in
            a hurry to give her a green jacket -- the symbol of membership
            in the 80-year-old club. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You can't say it's an equal-rights issue anymore because
            they admitted a couple women,' Roth said. 'Now it's Augusta
            playing by its own arcane rules, as always, and they have
            nothing to gain by playing into the controversy.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Sued by Mexico's Iusacell for $2.5 Billion Over Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) was sued by Iusacell SA, Mexico's third-biggest mobile-phone provider, for $2.5 billion in lost
            profits tied to a 2010
            deal that failed. IBM claims the lawsuit is intended to avoid
            arbitration over the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iusacell consulted with IBM in connection with a multiyear
            plan to increase market share and revenue, the company said in a
            heavily redacted complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
            court. Iusacell alleged IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations
            that caused it to suffer damages and lose profits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully
            concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during
            the parties' relationship,' Iusacell said in the complaint. The
            public version of the filing doesn't explain the alleged
            wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM said today that Iusacell and IBM Mexico entered into a
            'long term contract under which IBM Mexico made significant
            investments in Iusacell's business operations' that resulted in
            'major improvement to Iusacell's information technology
            infrastructure and growth in Iusacell's revenues.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The matter is in arbitration, said Doug Shelton, a
            spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iusacell, co-owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas and by
            Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the country's largest broadcaster, has
            struggled to compete with larger rivals such as America Movil
            SAB (AMXL) and Telefonica SA. (TEF) The company had 8 million subscribers at
            the end of 2013, or about 8 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa recorded a fourth-quarter loss from joint ventures
            of 4.74 billion pesos ($363 million), mostly to write down the
            value of Iusacell. It acquired its 50 percent stake in the
            company from Salinas for $1.6 billion in 2012 and invested an
            additional 1.59 billion pesos last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salinas is Mexico's fourth-richest person and No. 129 on
            the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $9.1
            billion. He has sued to block Mexico's stock exchange from
            removing his retail company from the benchmark index and the
            government's plans to auction off wireless airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dan McCosh, a spokesman for Salinas's group of companies,
            declined to immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Iusacell SA de CV v. International Business
            Machines Corp., 14-cv-02697, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services company, plans to cut as
            much as 14 percent of its French workforce, Agence France Presse
            reported, citing a union leader. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firings will total 1,200 to 1,400 over two years,
            Gerard Chameau, a representative of the French Democratic
            Confederation of Labor, told the wire service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is seeking to reduce
            expenses as economic weakness in Europe takes a toll on
            potential customers. The company is shifting resources to focus
            on growing markets such as Africa that have increasing demand
            for technology and consulting help. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. The
            company is scheduled to report first-quarter results today after
            the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chameau didn't immediately reply to an e-mail message from
            Bloomberg News seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM slid less than 1 percent to $208.53 at 12:28 p.m. in
            New York. The shares had climbed 9.5 percent this year through
            yesterday, outpacing the 8.8 percent gain of the Standard
            Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Roche Dissolves Applied Science Unit as It Ends IBM Alliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG (ROG) will dissolve its
            Applied Science unit as it sees further price pressure and
            funding cuts in life-science research and said it's ended an
            alliance with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Swiss drugmaker said its polymerase chain reaction
            technology and nucleic acid product lines business will become
            part of its Molecular Diagnostics unit. The custom biotechnology
            portfolio will join the Professional Diagnostics business, while
            the company will create a unit to focus solely on sequencing,
            the Basel-based drugmaker said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reorganization will affect 110 jobs in Penzberg,
            Germany and 60 in Branford, Connecticut, Roche said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Roche and IBM agreed in July 2010 to try to make genome
            sequencing for medical purposes cheaper and more common. The
            drugmaker said today it had ended its partnership with IBM for
            the development of a nanopore-based sequencing platform, due to
            high technical risks involved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Roche said its outlook for 2013 remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Introduces New Power Server Amid 'Repositioning' of Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), seeking to revitalize hardware sales, introduced a new
            Power Systems server with an open platform that gives programmers more flexibility to develop uses for the
            device. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM spent $2.4 billion in more than three years to create the hardware, which is
            used in data centers. The system has more than 11 miles (18 kilometers) of copper wiring, which helps the
            servers process large amounts of data, the company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new
            offering comes after a 22 percent decline in first-quarter sales for Power Systems, a unit which Chief
            Financial Officer Martin Schroeter this month said the company is 'aggressively repositioning.' The new
            products are designed to address growing areas like cloud computing and data analytics, helping IBM counter
            weak demand for older hardware that has dragged down total revenue for eight straight quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM Tries to Adapt. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'We are thinking differently about how to help clients
            transform their business with the right infrastructure,' Tom Rosamilia, IBM's senior vice president for
            systems and technology, said in an interview. 'This is leveraging a lot of the things we've done with open
            systems before but never really around the hardware.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York,
            got advice in building the servers from fellow members of the OpenPower Foundation -- a 25-member group of
            companies that support open-source technology. Members of the group, which includes Google Inc. and Nvidia
            Corp., are working with IBM and on their own on other technology based on the same Power8 processor chip
            that the new Power Systems servers use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new IBM systems will sell for around $8,000,
            which is about $2,000 less than past models, Rosamilia said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>IBM Enlists Watson Ahead of Pentagon Health Solictation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) will add technology from its Watson supercomputer, known
            for beating humans on 'Jeopardy!,' to its federal health unit
            before the Pentagon seeks bids on a $11 billion health-records
            project. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest computer services provider also is
            hiring Keith Salzman, a former chief medical information officer
            at the Army hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where the Pentagon
            plans to test the new health records project, for its U.S.
            federal team. Salzman will become the division's chief medical
            officer, IBM said in a news release today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, whose U.S. agency contracts have slipped over the past
            two years, is making the changes as companies prepare to compete
            to deliver a new electronic medical-records system for the
            Defense Department. The lifecycle cost of the project may be as
            much as $11 billion, Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of
            defense for health affairs, said in testimony before a U.S.
            House appropriations subcommittee this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have to bring a lot to the table in federal health
            care,' Andrew Maner, IBM's managing partner for its U.S.
            federal division, said in a telephone interview. 'Watson is not
            going to implement an electronic medical-records solution, but
            it can be used to make clinicians better or more efficient.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company, which had $1.2 billion
            in U.S. agency contracts during the fiscal year that ended Sept.
            30, was the government's No. 51 supplier, according to a
            Bloomberg Government ranking of the top 200 vendors released
            April 22. It slipped six spots from the prior year, when it had
            about $1.5 billion in U.S. contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Jeopardy' Success &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM will offer technology from its Watson Group to
            aggregate and study clinical information for U.S. health
            agencies, according to the press release. Watson, an artificial-intelligence system best known for its
            success on the
            'Jeopardy!' television quiz show, can analyze large amounts of
            data. That may help cut costs, speed medical research and
            improve care, the company said in its release. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Maner declined to comment on whether IBM would compete for
            the records project or include Watson technology in a potential
            bid. It wants to see the government's solicitation for the work
            first, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If IBM does bid, 'you need to show up with everything,'
            Maner said. That includes the right commercial and federal
            experience, the best bidding partners, as well as 'innovative
            technology,' such as Watson, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Information technology services companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), based in Palo Alto,
            California; Leidos Holdings
            Inc. (LDOS), based in Reston, Virginia; and IBM are likely to bid on
            the Pentagon health records work, said Brian Friel, a Bloomberg
            Industries analyst. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Boosts Quarterly Dividend by 16% as Buybacks Slow</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) raised its quarterly dividend by 16 percent to $1.10
            per share as Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty tries to appease shareholders while the company shifts
            businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM announced the increase from 95 cents a share in a press release today
            before the start of its annual meeting. The new dividend is more than the $1.05 a share projected, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 15-cent increase will cost Armonk, New York-based IBM about $625 million
            a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, IBM reported its eighth straight quarterly decline in
            revenue as it shifts its business from hardware to cloud computing and data analysis. Rometty is banking on
            a strong comeback in the coming quarters as she aims to deliver on a forecast for adjusted earnings of at
            least $18 a share this year. The larger-than-expected dividend boost comes as IBM plans to reduce its pace
            of stock buybacks following an $8.2 billion splurge in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Today's
            announcement reinforces our commitment to delivering value to shareholders,' Rometty said in the statement.
            'We will continue to invest aggressively in our strategic growth areas including cloud, big data analytics,
            social, mobile and security to position the company to drive growth and higher value for our clients.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, boosted its
            dividend 12 percent and approved $5 billion in stock buybacks,
            rewarding investors after a disappointing earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dividend of 95 cents a share will be payable on June 10
            to shareholders of record on May 10, IBM said today from its
            annual meeting in Huntsville, Alabama. With the additional
            buyback funds, IBM has $11.2 billion in its repurchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who took the reins
            at IBM in January 2012, is returning more cash to shareholders
            after a rare earnings shortfall sent the stock tumbling 8.3
            percent in one day. The company's first-quarter profit, released
            on April 18, missed analysts' estimates for the first time since
            2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM rose 1.7 percent to $202.54 at the close today in New
            York. The shares have climbed 5.7 percent this year, compared
            with a 12 percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company also is making
            management changes in the wake of the earnings report. Rod Adkins, the head of IBM's hardware division, will
            become senior
            vice president of corporate strategy, a person familiar with the
            matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM-Apple App Deal for Businesses Hits Snag as China Spurns IPad</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)'s goal to dominate the business application market
            through a partnership with former rival Apple Inc. (AAPL) has hit a snag where IBM has faced challenges
            before: China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China's government excluded Apple products such as iPads and iPad Minis
            from the list of products that can be bought with public money because of security concerns, according to
            government officials familiar with the matter. That means the business-software apps IBM is building for
            those tablets may face hurdles reaching the burgeoning Chinese corporate market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Chinese government has been excluding U.S. technology companies from publicly-funded purchases and reviewed
            reliance on foreign products as tensions escalate between the countries over claims of hacking and
            cyberspying. The move against Apple products could deter the potential corporate customers that IBM is
            counting on to expand its mobile business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The large businesses in China tend to buy
            where the government leads,' Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., said in an interview.
            'There's a point of national pride here. I would expect that pattern to continue.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lia
            Davis, a spokeswoman for Armonk, New York-based IBM, declined to comment on the Chinese government's move.

        <headline>IBM Chip Inspired by Human Brain Can Sense Images, Cut Energy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's engineers have come up with a way computer chips can think more like humans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;International
            Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said it's produced a chip that more closely replicates the way the human brain
            operates than traditional processors do. The new architecture is better at tasks like image recognition in
            video data -- which could be a new way to help computers sense movement. On top of that, the chip uses less
            energy than traditional designs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the design eventually turns into a product, it could
            help the processor industry, which is searching for new ways to make its products run computers faster. It's
            increasingly turning to new methods of trying to perform multiple tasks at the same time, since traditional
            designs that simply counted faster have led to overheating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM said that traditional
            computer science, which uses linear logic to process data, is inefficient. Processors basically perform one
            operation at a time, then react to the result of the previous calculation. The computer chip IBM has
            developed, described in a paper in the journal Science, has 1 million programmable neurons based on 5.4
            billion transistors. Its 'neurosynaptic' cores can each compute and communicate in parallel, rather than in
            a row. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM's statement on the chip design didn't contain information about when the
            technology would go into commercial production or go on sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company's labs are so
            renowned in the industry that titans like Samsung use its technology for their production. That reputation
            in research hasn't translated to a leadership position in the chip business, which is dominated by Intel
            Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Balancing Needs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM has had to balance two distinct needs
            when it comes to its semiconductor business: having control over chip design to make its hardware products
            better and more efficient, though wanting to get the money-losing manufacturing unit off its books. The
            division loses as much as $1.5 billion a year, a person familiar with the matter said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company was willing to pay Globalfoundries Inc. about $1 billion to take the chip-manufacturing
            unit of its hands -- an offer that was turned down for being $1 billion too short, a person familiar with
            the talks said this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>IBM Obtains U.S. Approval for Sale of Server Business to Lenovo</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) cleared a U.S. national-security review for the sale of
            its low-end server business to China's Lenovo Group Ltd. (992),
            letting the $2.3 billion transaction go forward even amid
            tensions between the two nations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The conclusion of the review by the Committee on Foreign
            Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, is 'good news for both IBM
            and Lenovo, and for our customers and employees,' Armonk, New
            York-based IBM said yesterday in a statement. While Cfius placed
            some conditions on the deal, they don't significantly affect the
            business, and terms of the transaction didn't change as result,
            a person with knowledge of the matter said, without specifying
            the conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale drew scrutiny because of disputes between China
            and the U.S., the world's two largest economies, over
            cyberintrusions. By completing the deal, IBM can jettison a less
            profitable business to focus on growing areas, such as cloud
            computing and data analytics, while giving Lenovo a bigger piece
            of the global computing-hardware market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is part of IBM's process moving away from hardware
            manufacturing to a more service-oriented product line and more
            profitable product lines,' Ivan Feinseth, chief investment
            officer at Tigress Financial Partners LLC, said in an interview.
            'They are trying to change the direction they are going.' He
            has a neutral rating on IBM stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for IBM and Lenovo declined to comment on whether
            the Cfius clearance included any requirements or concessions.
            Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which
            leads Cfius, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Essentially Commodities &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IBM servers, known as x86 for the type of chips they
            use, link computers on corporate networks and are essentially
            commodities in the information technology world, Christopher Padilla, IBM's vice president for governmental
            programs, said in
            January. Most of IBM's x86 servers are made in Shenzhen, China,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The clearance of the national-security review may also bode
            well for Lenovo's separate $2.91 billion purchase of Google
            Inc.'s Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to work through a number of regulatory and
            business processes to ensure an effective and timely closure on
            both deals,' Lenovo, which has its headquarters in Beijing and
            Morrisville, North Carolina, said in a statement. 'We remain on
            track to close both deals by the end of the year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Maintenance Continues &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. agencies, including the Defense Department and the
            Department of Homeland Security, buy the IBM servers, according
            to Bloomberg Intelligence. The companies were able to head off a
            lot of government concerns on the x86 deal because IBM has
            agreed to continue maintenance on existing servers for five
            years, said the person with knowledge of the matter, who asked
            not to be identified because the process was private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Cfius review took 150 days to complete, with the
            companies forced to resubmit the transaction after an initial
            75-day investigation expired, the person said. Cfius asked
            hundreds of questions during the probe, primarily focusing on
            maintenance of installed IBM servers and Lenovo's access to
            them, while also paying heed to heightened concern and scrutiny
            about any Chinese transaction in the U.S. technology sector, the
            person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cfius examines acquisitions of U.S. companies by foreign
            investors to determine the effects on national security. The
            U.S. on May 19 accused five Chinese military officials of
            stealing trade secrets and other information from American
            companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Examination &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo was successful in getting Cfius approval in 2005 for
            an earlier deal, in which the Chinese company acquired IBM's
            personal-computer unit for $1.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cfius examined more than double the number of transactions
            by Chinese investors in 2012 than it did the previous year,
            making them the most scrutinized foreign buyers of American
            assets ahead of the U.K., according to the committee's most
            recent report to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo had agreed to pay a fee more than double the typical
            size should it fail to acquire IBM's low-end server unit, people
            familiar with the matter said in January. The breakup charge of
            about $200 million, according to one of the people, highlights
            the risk the Chinese company has chosen to bear for its largest-ever purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM's Watson Goes From Jeopardy Player to Scientist Used by J&amp;amp;J</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) wants you to know that its Watson technology can do more
            than win 'Jeopardy!' -- it can now help accelerate scientific
            research and discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, in a peer-reviewed paper with Baylor College of
            Medicine, used the Watson Discovery Advisor technology to map
            connections within troves of scientific research. The ability to
            point scientists toward new hypotheses and patterns in data is
            also being used by Johnson Johnson (JNJ) to help develop medicines
            and find additional uses for existing drugs, IBM said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since the 'Jeopardy!' win in 2011 proved Watson can
            answer questions and analyze data in natural human language, IBM
            has been trying to commercialize the technology by showing how
            it can be applied to customer service and financial planning. As
            declining demand for IBM's hardware has led to nine straight
            quarters of falling sales, the company has turned to data
            analytics tools like Watson as a new source of growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've gone from co-creating with these early partners to
            creating a commercial offering,' John Gordon, vice president of
            IBM's Watson Group, said in a phone interview, referring to
            Baylor and JJ. 'In the past we've talked about how Watson can
            help people find answers to things that are known. We are
            shifting to really helping innovators investigate the great
            problems of our time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has been marketing different uses for Watson since the
            company spent about $1 billion to create a new business unit
            around the tool. Financial-services firm USAA said last month it
            will use Watson on its website to answer military customers'
            questions about transitioning back to civilian life -- the first
            wide-scale test with consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;70,000 Articles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Watson's new science applications identify potentially
            unknown points of interest about a topic, instead of only
            finding direct answers to specific questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baylor used the tool to analyze the abstracts of 70,000
            scientific articles on a specific cancer-related protein to
            predict other compounds that may interact with it. Using
            frequent words to rank and map relationships, the researchers
            identified six proteins to investigate, more than the one that
            scientists typically discover in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Johnson Johnson, whose Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky will join IBM's board next week, will
            use Watson to
            analyze drug data to potentially allow researchers to more
            quickly ask questions about the effectiveness and side effects
            of medical treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This points them to the next great idea,' Gordon said.
            'It's kind of Watson becoming a scientist.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Sued Over Claim Spy Program Cooperation Hurt Sales</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;An International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) shareholder sued the company over claims its cooperation
            with a National Security Agency eavesdropping program caused a
            drop in sales in China, hurting investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension and Relief Fund, in a
            complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court, accuses
            IBM of defrauding investors by concealing that sales slowed
            after Edward Snowden disclosed the company was cooperating with
            the NSA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In June, documents released by Snowden revealed the NSA's
            'Prism' surveillance program, which used information from
            technology companies such as IBM, the pension fund said. IBM
            also lobbied in favor of a bill that would allow it to share
            customers' personal data, including data from users in China,
            with the NSA, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The company knew but misrepresented or concealed from
            investors that the disclosures of its lobbying and its
            association with the Prism and NSA spying scandal caused
            businesses in China as well as the Chinese government to
            abruptly halt doing business with IBM, leading to an immediate,
            and precipitous decline in sales,' the pension fund said in its
            complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;China Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 16, IBM, the largest computer-services provider,
            reported a 22 percent drop in sales in China compared with the
            previous quarter as a result of the Snowden disclosures,
            according to the Louisiana fund, which said it pays retirement,
            death and disability benefits to more than 20,000 active and
            retired employees of sheriff's offices throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suit is 'pushing a wild conspiracy theory,' IBM's
            general counsel, Robert Weber, said in a statement today. 'This
            lawsuit seeks to confuse IBM's support for a U.S. cybersecurity
            legislative proposal -- which has yet to be enacted -- with the
            completely unrelated NSA surveillance program called PRISM,'
            Weber said in the statement. 'Even a cursory reading of the
            legislative proposal, known as CISPA, makes clear that it has
            nothing to do with the recently disclosed NSA surveillance
            program.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pension fund is seeking to represent a class of
            investors who bought IBM stock from June 25 to Oct. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension Relief Fund v.
            International Business Machines Corp., 13-cv-08818, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Apple to IBM Push Buyback to Record Trading</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Companies buying their own stock make up more of the U.S. equity market than ever before,
            underpinning share values even as the Federal Reserve prepares to reduce stimulus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stock
            acquired under company repurchase programs represented 6.4 percent of daily trading in the Russell 3000
            Index by value through Sept. 30, exceeding 2007's level of 4.1 percent, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg and Birinyi Associates Inc. The proportion of trading is higher even as chief executive officers
            spend $343 billion less on buybacks so far this year, reflecting a seven-year decline in equity volume. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. to Walt Disney Co. and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) took advantage of
            record-low interest rates to raise an unprecedented amount of debt financing and repurchased stock, helping
            boost per-share U.S. earnings for four years. With cash at a record, buying by companies is poised to
            continue in a bull market that is about to enter its sixth year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The mathematics are
            pretty compelling,' Martin Leclerc, founder of Barrack Yard Advisors LLC and a 30-year veteran of investment
            management, said in a telephone interview Dec. 11. His firm oversees $260 million. 'There will be continued
            shareholder buybacks, even increased shareholder buybacks, because things are pretty good.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stocks
            Beat &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains in the 100 Standard Poor's 500 Index stocks (SPX) with the most purchases
            relative to market value have beaten the full index this year, 40 percent to 27 percent, including
            dividends. Since March 2009, companies focused on buybacks have risen 270 percent, compared with the SP
            500's 190 percent. Stocks fell 1.6 percent last week after speculation an improving economy would spur the
            Fed to cut stimulus as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 0.6 percent to 1,786.54 at
            4 p.m. New York time today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies have helped offset trading lost as about $400
            billion was withdrawn from mutual funds that invest in American stocks from 2009 through 2012. Buybacks as a
            proportion of the value of stocks traded have increased each of the last four years as companies purchased
            $1.88 trillion of shares since 2009, according to Birinyi and Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trading
            Falls &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stock trading fell every year since 2007, based on data for the Russell 3000,
            which is composed of companies representing 98 percent of the investable U.S. equity market, according to
            the Russell website. The data on buybacks compares the average daily value of repurchases each year compared
            with the overall value of shares changing hands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SP 500 earnings reached more than $100
            a share last year, compared with about $60 in 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They're forecast to
            rise 5.3 percent to $109.40 in 2013, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I
            don't think we're anywhere near the level of overall valuation where companies will not buy stock back,'
            Paul Zemsky, the head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, which oversees $190 billion, said in
            a telephone interview Dec. 11. 'Companies are still buying stock.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SP 500's
            price-earnings ratio has increased 17 percent this year to 16.7. While the multiple reached 17 last month,
            the highest level in almost four years, the average since 1998 is about 19, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple (AAPL), the world's largest company by market value, borrowed $17 billion in its
            first bond sale since 1996 to help fund a $55 billion addition to its capital return plan. The offering was
            the largest on record until Verizon Communications Inc. sold $49 billion in bonds in September. Shares of
            the Cupertino, California-based company have rallied 25 percent since the April 30 announcement, more than
            the 11 percent gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;IBM, Disney &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in
            Armonk, New York, bought back about $35 billion since the end of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
            world's largest provider of computing services has said it plans to repurchase $50 billion from 2011 to
            2015. While revenue has fallen the last six quarters, buybacks have helped per-share earnings expand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, plans to purchase between $6 billion and $8
            billion in shares this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said during a
            Sept. 12 conference call. The Burbank, California-based company has bought back about $3 billion in calendar
            2013, Birinyi data show. Disney, which has about $4 billion in cash and short-term investments and an A
            credit rating, has seen shares climb 40 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Advance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) gained 73 percent the last three years. The New York-based company said it plans
            to buy back $39 billion of stock, including a June announcement for $10 billion. The world's biggest
            drugmaker acquired more than $11 billion so far this year, according to Birinyi data. Pfizer sold $4 billion
            of bonds in May, its first dollar-denominated offering in more than four years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            $1.137 trillion of investment-grade corporate bonds issued this year is a record, topping last year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the average yield of 3.11 percent is up from the record low
            2.65 percent in May, it's still almost 1.8 percentage points below the decade mean, Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A lot of companies are using their cash flow to buy back shares
            and quite a few companies are borrowing money to buy back shares,' Edward Yardeni, president and chief
            investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc. in New York said in a Dec. 11 phone interview. 'That will
            probably continue at the pace we're seeing now.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fed Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Fed has kept its benchmark lending rate near zero since December 2008 and implemented three rounds of
            economic stimulus programs. The central bank will reduce its $85 billion monthly bond purchases at the Dec.
            17-18 meeting, according to 34 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg Dec. 6. Nine of the 35 economists
            surveyed said the central bank will buy fewer bonds at its January meeting, and the remaining 14 predict
            tapering will start in March. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While share buybacks have boosted earnings, they're also a
            sign that the economy isn't strong enough to support corporate investments, according to Bruce McCain, who
            helps oversee more than $25 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in
            Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;GDP Expands &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product expanded 1.7 percent
            this year, down from 2.8 percent in 2012, according to 86 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
            U.S. economy increased an average of 2.3 percent per quarter since 2009, the weakest recovery since World
            War II. While a report last week showed retail sales rose more than forecast in November, a separate release
            showed unemployment benefits increased. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'At the margin we're seeing some improvements in
            the economy, but there doesn't seem to be a significant pickup,' McCain said in a Dec. 11 phone interview.
            'It's a tough environment for companies to find projects where they can put more money into a new capacity,
            when most industries are struggling.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To LPL Financial LLC's Jeffery Kleintop, a
            slowdown in share repurchases wouldn't be a negative sign. After a record year of corporate buying,
            companies will shift next year to investing their extra cash in plants, equipment and more workers as sales
            pick up with the economy, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue is forecast to grow almost twice as fast in
            2014 as it did this year. Analysts project SP 500 companies will boost sales 4.1 percent to $1,134 per share
            next year, then another 4.5 percent to $1,166 in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Cash &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We may not see as many buybacks,' Kleintop, chief market
            strategist at LPL in Boston, which manages about $400 billion, said in a Dec. 11 phone interview. 'It'll be
            positive. Businesses will actually be investing in fundamental growth and not financial engineering. Next
            year, the growth in earnings will be much more focused on fundamental growth, which is much more healthy.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief executives have record cash that could keep buybacks going or be used to fund
            investments. SP 500 companies had $1.14 trillion of cash and equivalents as of June 30 and are on track to
            top that for the third quarter, according to data compiled by SP. The total has increased every quarter
            since Sept. 30, 2012, and is almost twice the level when the SP 500 last reached a record in October 2007.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies authorized $728 billion in repurchase programs this year, compared to $467
            billion at this point last year, Birinyi data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Buybacks are a good thing,' Thomas
            Garcia, the head of equity trading at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management Inc. said
            in a Dec. 11 phone interview. His firm oversees $90 billion. 'They're willing to purchase shares. It's a
            good thing to see that they have cash flow.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>IBM May Need Multibillion-Dollar Deal to Jump-Start Sales</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM)'s plan to spend almost $15 billion on deals through 2015
            is turning NetApp Inc. (NTAP) and Splunk Inc. (SPLK) into takeover candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM finds itself looking for deals after sales increased
            just 0.8 percent in four years, the worst rate since the period
            that ended in 2002, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Investors have taken notice, with its shares lagging behind
            those of rivals Oracle Corp. and SAP AG by the most in at least
            nine years in 2012, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, with a market value of $232 billion, has
            identified areas for expansion through the end of 2015. Sterne
            Agee Leach Inc. sees NetApp, which has almost doubled revenue
            since 2008, strengthening IBM's standing in cloud storage.
            Splunk, which has rallied almost twofold since its initial
            public offering last year, would help IBM meet a goal of growing
            in data analytics, according to Credit Agricole SA. Royal Bank
            of Canada says Imperva Inc. (IMPV) would bolster its position in
            security products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It'll probably be a surprise acquisition that will really
            get things going,' Laurence Balter, an analyst with Oracle
            Investment Research in Fox Island, Washington, said in a
            telephone interview. 'Unless IBM does something real
            interesting, an acquisition down the road or something that will
            stir up growth, we're at a little bit of a plateau.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
            said the company doesn't comment on potential acquisition
            targets. NetApp's Roger Villareal, Splunk's Ken Tinsley and
            Imperva's Rob Rachwald also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM shares rose 1 percent to $205.18 today, closing at the
            highest price in more than three months. NetApp climbed 0.7
            percent to $36.25, Splunk rallied 2.9 percent to $33.90, and
            Imperva added 2 percent to $35. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has faced pressure for years to expand through deals,
            with investors saying in 2010 that profit growth hinged on doing
            a multibillion-dollar acquisition. The company managed to
            increase net income to $16.6 billion last year, up 12 percent
            from $14.8 billion in 2010, even without announcing any
            transactions that eclipsed its two biggest: the 2008 purchase of
            Cognos Inc. for $4.5 billion and the $3.9 billion deal for
            PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's consulting business in 2002. Both
            figures include net debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's preference is to strike deals valued at $200
            million to $1.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
            said in May. 'We are not looking at big acquisitions, nor do we
            want to communicate that we're looking at big acquisitions,' he
            said during the presentation at a conference. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Larger Scale' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To make a difference in IBM's revenue, which totaled $104.5
            billion last year, up just 0.8 percent since 2008, the company
            may have to consider bigger transactions, said Joe Foresi, a
            Boston-based analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Clearly, given the size of the company, acquisitions will
            have to be on a larger scale,' he said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has a goal of doing $20 billion of deals from the start
            of 2011 through the end of 2015. Counting already announced
            transactions, IBM has $14.5 billion left to spend. IBM completed
            11 purchases in 2012, including five in data analysis and two in
            cloud computing, according to the company. It bought Worklight
            Inc. for mobile tools and spent $1.2 billion including net cash
            on Kenexa Corp. to add social business capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Takeover Speculation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Splunk, a $3.3 billion company based in San Francisco,
            could help IBM grab a larger slice of the global market for
            analyzing large, complex databases that should reach $48.3
            billion by 2018, up from $6.3 billion in 2012, according to
            Transparency Market Research. Splunk also has intellectual
            property for data analysis that would be valuable to IBM, said
            Edward Maguire, a New York-based analyst at Credit Agricole. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Splunk's shares rose 6.9 percent on Jan. 15 amid
            speculation it could be bought by IBM or Oracle, according to
            Brian White, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Buying Splunk makes sense from a products perspective,
            because Splunk is a gigantic analytics engine,' Peter Goldmacher, a San Francisco-based analyst at Cowen
            Group Inc.,
            said in a phone interview. 'It can take data from data centers
            or cars or planes, and that's what IBM is all about.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate Splunk's sales increased 60 percent in
            the fiscal year that ended in January, according to the average
            of projections compiled by Bloomberg. It went public in April
            and has since rallied 94 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM today said it's buying Star Analytics Inc. for an
            undisclosed amount. The Redwood City, California-based company
            integrates business information and helps sort out what's
            important, eliminating time-consuming steps for data analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Weak Areas' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NetApp, valued at $13 billion, has been speculated as an
            IBM target for years, said Shaw Wu, a San Francisco-based
            analyst at Sterne Agee Leach. The computer-storage company
            would bolster IBM's cloud-computing plans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Storage is definitely one of the weak areas for the
            company,' Wu said in a phone interview. 'For them to get
            stronger there would make sense.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The analyst said IBM may have to pay a 30 percent to 100
            percent premium for NetApp, which at current prices would exceed
            the $14.5 billion left in IBM's projected takeover budget. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adding Imperva, valued at $842 million, would help IBM's
            customers better protect applications and data, particularly
            information on remote servers referred to as the cloud, said
            Amit Daryanani, a San Francisco-based analyst at RBC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Juniper, Akamai &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales at the Redwood Shores, California-based company rose
            30 percent in 2012, according to the average of analysts'
            forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Imperva's software for managing
            databases, files, Web applications, servers and hardware
            appliances is used by more than 2,000 customers -- including top
            telecommunications providers, U.S. banks and government agencies
            -- in over 60 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sterne Agee's Wu said that a purchase of Juniper Networks
            Inc. (JNPR) would add higher-margin hardware, helping IBM compete with
            Cisco Systems Inc., while adding security capabilities. Akamai
            Technologies Inc. (AKAM) would bolster IBM's cloud plans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Juniper's Cindy Ta and Akamai's Rob Morton declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today, shares of Juniper declined 0.3 percent to $22.32.
            Akamai rallied 2.7 percent, the most in a month, to $41.81. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM rallied 4.4 percent on Jan. 23, the most in a year,
            after the world's biggest computer-services provider forecast
            profit that exceeded analysts' estimates. Last year, shares of
            Redwood City, California-based Oracle rallied 30 percent, versus
            IBM's 4.2 percent gain, while SAP of Walldorf, Germany, rose 49
            percent. Oracle won by the most since 1999, while SAP last
            outperformed IBM by that amount in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're probably aware that the absence of top-line
            growth hurts the stock price,' David Grossman, a San Francisco-
            based analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., said in a phone
            interview. 'They're constantly evolving their strategy.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Uses Dutch Tax Haven to Boost Profits as Sales Slide</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. has reduced its tax rate to a two-decade low with help from a
            tax strategy that sends profits through a Dutch subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The approach, which involves
            routing almost all sales in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and some of the Americas through the
            Netherlands unit, helped IBM as it gradually reduced its tax rate over 20 years at the same time pretax
            income quadrupled. Then last year, the rate slid to the lowest level since at least 1994, lifting earnings
            above analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
            up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a goal made more difficult as the company posted seven straight quarters of
            declining revenue. To stay on target, IBM has bought back shares, sold assets, and fired and furloughed
            workers. A less prominent though vital role is played by its subsidiary in the Netherlands, one of the most
            important havens for multinational companies looking for ways to legally reduce their tax rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've got a lot of ways to beat earnings and they definitely take advantage of it,' said Josh
            Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones Co. 'It's part of how IBM operates.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM ended 2013
            with a tax provision $1.84 billion lower than it initially projected, thanks to a tax rate of 15.6 percent
            -- compared with its forecast of 25 percent. Without the lower rate, the company's earnings per share would
            have fallen from the previous year instead of rising, and net income would have missed analysts' estimates
            by about 14 percent instead of 2.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

            Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has stuck with IBM's profit goals. To stay on track for her
            $20-a-share earnings target, the company spent $1 billion last year to restructure its workforce -- shedding
            3,300 employees in the U.S. andCanada, according to employee group Alliance@IBM. Close

        <headline>IBM Judge Won't Drop Demand for Reports in Bribe Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The federal judge overseeing a
            settlement between International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and
            U.S. regulators over alleged foreign bribes said he won't drop
            demands for reports of possible wrongdoing by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who refused to accept the
            deal the company struck with the Securities and Exchange
            Commission, denied IBM's request to alter a requirement that he
            be told about any future law enforcement or administrative or
            probes. He agreed to narrow his insistence that IBM tell him of
            accounting violations to include only those involving payments
            covered by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bear in mind, this is a company that has a history of
            violating the books and records provision of the FCPA,' Leon
            said today during a 20-minute hearing in Washington. 'This is a
            company that has made major payments to foreign governments in
            the past.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leon said in December there's a growing awareness among
            federal judges of the need for more rigorous review of corporate
            settlement agreements. Even so, his extended challenge to an
            agreed-upon settlement between a company and the government is a
            rare occurrence. Of 34 foreign bribery settlements the SEC
            reached with companies since 2010, only two others failed to win
            judicial sign-off in less than three months. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp.
            raised $2 billion in a two-part bond offering that included
            floating-rate debt yielding less than the benchmark interest
            rate for more than $300 trillion of financial products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest computer-services provider issued equal $1
            billion portions of notes due 2015 that pay 2 basis points less
            than the London interbank offered rate and 1.25 percent
            securities maturing 2018 that yield 47 basis points more than
            similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's floater sale follows offerings last year by Coca-Cola
            Co. and Procter Gamble Co., which both issued securities
            paying less than Libor, the rate at which banks say they can
            borrow in dollars from each other. Proceeds from IBM's sale will
            be used for general corporate purposes, the Armonk, New York-
            based company said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The computer maker's $1.6 billion of 7.625 percent bonds
            due October 2018 traded yesterday at 132 cents on the dollar to
            yield 1.7 percent, or 81 basis points more than Treasuries,
            according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM last sold floating-rate debt in December 2010, with a
            $1 billion offering of securities due June 2012 that paid 3
            basis points more than Libor, Bloomberg data show. The new bonds
            are expected to be rated Aa3 by Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM to Spend $100 Million to Bring Watson Technology to Africa</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
            is raising its bet on Africa by spending $100 million to bring
            its Watson technology to the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest computer-services provider plans to
            introduce Watson, an artificial-intelligence system best known
            for beating humans on the 'Jeopardy!' game show, to government
            agencies, universities, scientists and other partners in Africa
            to process socioeconomic information, the company said in a
            statement. It will also establish a research center to help
            advance a 10-year IBM initiative to spur development. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The moves are part of an effort by Chief Executive Officer
            Ginni Rometty to make the continent into a growth engine for
            IBM, which has reported seven consecutive quarters of falling
            revenue. Last year's 5 percent sales decline in its traditional
            growth markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China helped drag
            down total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Africa, 'we're getting more partners and we're helping
            the economic development,' Solomon Assefa, an IBM researcher,
            said in an interview. 'Africa is really moving forward. We
            believe that this investment reflects that it's also a very good
            business decision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM will be expanding its investment in Watson as the
            Armonk, New York-based company looks to data analytics to boost
            growth. IBM said last month that it will spend $1 billion to
            create a new division around Watson, which analyzes troves of
            data and can answer questions in conversational language. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Research Center &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, the company opened a research laboratory in
            Nairobi, Kenya, its 12th in the world. In 2013, IBM had
            operations in more than 20 African countries, up from four in
            2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Watson can analyze large amounts of data after the
            information is uploaded to the tool. Assefa said IBM's new
            research center, the Center of Excellence for Data-Driven
            Development, will serve as a central point for universities,
            government agencies and other partners to upload data. Assefa
            declined to comment on partners for the project. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Health care and education will be two initial focus areas
            for which IBM intends to deploy the Watson technology, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Leads 25% Rise in Bond Offerings in Rush to Beat Jobs Report</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
            and BP Plc led a 25 percent jump in U.S. company bond sales this
            week as borrowers rushed to lock in yields at about a seven-month low before a labor report today that
            showed employers
            added fewer jobs than economists projected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's biggest computer-services provider, and
            London-based BP led $23.8 billion of offerings that rose from
            $19.1 billion in the five days ended Jan. 31, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance compares with $24.3 billion in
            the first week of February 2013 and follows $140.8 billion of
            sales last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Offerings increased as companies sought to borrow before
            the report on employment growth that MFR economist Joshua
            Shapiro said might be a 'crapshoot.' Payrolls rose 113,000 in
            January, the Labor Department said, less than the 180,000 median
            forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Investors are
            watching for signs of weakness in the world's biggest economy
            amid a rout in emerging markets from Argentina to Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In any given month, it's the date on the calendar that
            issuers are most mindful about assessing,' Edward Marrinan, a
            macro credit strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford,
            Connecticut, said before the report. Weak jobs numbers 'give a
            lot of people a lot of reasons to get anxious about the growth
            story.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Assessing Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
            rather than government debentures reached 193 basis points
            yesterday, unchanged from Jan. 31, according to the Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate High Yield Index. Yields
            increased to 3.9 percent from 3.89 percent, and compare with a
            record low 3.35 percent in May. Yields last week touched 3.84
            percent, the lowest since June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM sold $4.5 billion of bonds in four parts including $2
            billion of 3.625 percent, 10-year notes to yield 95 basis points
            more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The
            Armonk, New York-based company also issued $1.5 billion of five-year notes in fixed- and floating-rate
            portions and $1 billion
            of two-year floaters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BP, Europe's second-largest oil company, issued $2.5
            billion of bonds in three parts through its BP Capital Markets
            unit, Bloomberg data show. The largest portion, $1.25 billion of
            3.81 percent, 10-year securities, priced with a relative yield
            of 115 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $17
            billion, compared with $13.2 billion last week and a weekly
            average of $21.9 billion in 2013, Bloomberg data show. Offerings
            of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.8 billion,

        <headline>IBM Pays More to Borrow in Bond Market as Sales Decline</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)'s borrowing costs are rising even as those of its peers
            fall, underscoring concerns that the world's largest seller of computer services is struggling to find its
            place in the cloud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM sold 10-year bonds last week with a 3.625 percent coupon,
            exceeding the cost of similar-maturity 3.375 percent notes issued in July even as average yields for debt in
            the company's AA rating tier contracted. Quarterly revenue dropped 5.5 percent in the last three months of
            2013 to $27.7 billion, the biggest decline since the U.S. economy exited its last recession, as an
            industrywide shift to offsite data storage erodes demand for IBM's hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big Blue
            Tries to Adapt. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It's an early signal that bondholders want a slightly larger
            premium to hold IBM because of the disappointing results, the challenges it's facing in the hardware
            business and favoring shareholder returns over improving balance-sheet fundamentals,' said Nikhill Patel, an
            analyst at San Antonio-based Frost Investment Advisors LLC, which oversees about $10 billion and doesn't own
            IBM bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Druckenmiller Short &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Debt investors are demanding higher
            interest rates about two months after money manager Stan Druckenmiller said he's betting against the stock
            of IBM, the only company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) to deliver a loss to shareholders last
            year. The century-old Armonk, New York-based business has attempted to support its equity by selling assets,
            using tax havens and repurchasing shares, which has coincided with an increase in its ratio of debt to cash
            flow. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Boosts Investment in Cloud Services to Attract Customers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) is expanding its cloud services to lure customers to its
            SoftLayer Technologies Inc. business, which it's counting on to
            help reverse seven quarters of falling sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is making it easier for developers to build and adjust
            applications in the cloud, where information is delivered online
            instead of stored on local servers, said Danny Sabbah, chief
            technology officer of IBM's Next Generation Platform. The
            Armonk, New York-based company plans to spend more than $1
            billion on cloud-software development through 2015, a double-digit percentage increase from the past two
            years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move increases IBM's bet on SoftLayer after acquiring
            the company for $2 billion last year and committing $1.2 billion
            in January to add 15 new data centers. As customers rely on the
            cloud rather than buying their own servers, a slump in hardware
            demand has contributed to IBM's declining revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is crucial to expanding the potential audience and
            helping them get benefit and value from using SoftLayer,'
            Sabbah said in an interview. 'This is not just about IBM's
            conventional enterprise customers. There will be a lot of
            emerging companies in different areas.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move underscores SoftLayer's position as one of IBM's
            biggest gambles as it faces off with competitors such as
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in cloud services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Big Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The price IBM paid to acquire Dallas-based SoftLayer last
            year was the biggest it has disclosed for a takeover since the
            purchase of software company Lotus Development Corp. in 1995,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SoftLayer is becoming
            the backbone for IBM's cloud business as the company wound down
            its legacy SmartCloud Enterprise product this year, Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of SoftLayer, said
            in an
            interview last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is making these new capabilities available for
            SoftLayer in hopes of attracting customers in different
            industries than the typical bank and insurance clients that use
            its cloud products at the moment, Sabbah said. One new addition
            is an open-source enterprise software portfolio called BlueMix,
            a platform-as-a-service that aims to help developers build
            applications on its cloud infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The service would rival existing platform-as-a-service
            products like Amazon's AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku Inc.'s
            development platform and Red Hat Inc.'s OpenShift. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has agreed to acquire Cloudant Inc., a cloud-delivered
            database company, whose services will be offered in the BlueMix
            portfolio, the company said today in a statement. Financial
            terms weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Watson Services &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SoftLayer will also gain middleware offerings, including
            WebSphere, to let apps be installed on hybrid clouds, which can
            access data both onsite and offsite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM also said last month that it would create a new
            business division around its Watson technology, which can
            analyze large volumes of data and answer questions in
            conversational language. IBM will invest more than $1 billion in
            the unit and give it a headquarters in New York. Watson's big-data services, which let customers mine vast
            troves of
            information, will be run on SoftLayer's cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM will integrate its Power Systems servers into
            SoftLayer's cloud to help support Watson and will make it
            available in the second quarter of this year, said Robert Leblanc, senior vice president of software and
            cloud solutions
            at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've been shifting resources for a number of years into
            this space,' Leblanc, said in an interview. 'The $1 billion is
            additional investment over the next two years to continue down
            that path and bring even more services out to the cloud.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Encourages Software Developers to Make Apps on Watson</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) is encouraging software developers to build applications
            on its artificial-intelligence system Watson, looking to data
            analytics to help reverse falling revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM will host a mobile developer challenge that urges
            programmers to create consumer and business apps powered by
            Watson, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said in a speech
            today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. In three
            months, the company will choose three prototypes to receive
            design consulting and support to develop commercial apps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has been increasing its investment in Watson as the
            Armonk, New York-based company works to show clients the value
            of the technology, which analyzes troves of data and can answer
            questions in conversational language. The company said in
            January that it will spend $1 billion to create a new division
            around Watson to help spur growth after seven consecutive
            quarters of declining revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You run a business today and you reinvent it for the
            future at the same time,' Rometty said. 'You go through these
            transitions. If you try to compare today to the past, today the
            speed is much faster.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer hardware has hurt sales,
            IBM has focused on more profitable, faster-growing areas such as
            data analytics and cloud computing, and the company has also
            sold hardware businesses. Watson and other big-data services
            were the company's primary focus in 2013, Rometty said in March.
            Last year, IBM boosted its expected sales from the data-analysis
            business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with an earlier
            forecast of $16 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Starts Cutting U.S. Jobs in $1 Billion Restructuring</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) began dismissing U.S. workers yesterday, part of a $1
            billion restructuring to help the company meet profit goals as
            it adapts to shifts in the technology industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Workers in New York, Vermont, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,
            Oklahoma and North Carolina were fired yesterday, according to
            Alliance@IBM, an employee group. The Armonk, New York-based
            company had a headcount of 431,212 at the end of 2013, down 0.7
            percent from a year earlier -- its first decline in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
            up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a target made more difficult by seven
            straight quarters of falling revenue. To get there, Chief
            Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has fired and furloughed
            workers, sold assets, cut IBM's tax rate and bought back shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has already begun eliminating positions this
            year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
            Alliance@IBM. Worldwide, this year's job cuts could lead to the
            elimination of at least 13,000 employees, Toni Sacconaghi, an
            analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., said in a Feb. 3 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rometty is seeking to transform IBM as clients shift to
            storing their data and applications offsite, or in the cloud,
            rather than buying their own servers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'IBM continues to rebalance its workforce to meet the
            changing requirements of its clients and to pioneer new, high-value segments of the IT industry,' the
            company said in a
            statement yesterday. At any given time, IBM has more than 3,000
            job openings in its growth units, including its cloud business
            and nanotechnology, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hudson Valley &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM had agreed to keep high-technology jobs in New York's
            Hudson Valley through 2016, increasing the number of positions
            it has pledged to retain by 750 to 3,100, New York Governor
            Andrew Cuomo said this week in a statement. That would restore
            the 697 workers fired last year in Dutchess County, where the
            company had about 8,000 employees as of 2012, according to the
            county government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Firings took place yesterday in Endicott and Poughkeepsie,
            New York, Alliance@IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The job cuts in New York raise questions about the newly
            brokered deal between the company and the state, said
            Assemblyman Kieran Lalor, who represents Fishkill, New York.
            Fishkill is a town in Dutchess County, where IBM has a
            semiconductor chip manufacturing plant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Both the state and IBM have been short on details about
            the agreement,' Lalor said in a letter dated Feb. 27 to Cuomo,
            requesting disclosure of how many people IBM employs in New York
            and information on the 3,900 jobs not guaranteed under the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Chip Plants &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM also makes semiconductor chips at its plant in
            Burlington, Vermont, and servers in Rochester, Minnesota,
            according to its website. The company has a delivery center in
            Dubuque, Iowa, that was to create as many as 1,300 jobs when it
            opened in 2009. The facility provides services including
            outsourcing-client support, server-systems operations, security
            services, and maintenance of hardware and software, according to
            the website. IBM dismissed workers in all three cities, in
            addition to Columbia, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and the
            Raleigh, North Carolina, area, Alliance@IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has already begun eliminating positions this
            year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
            Alliance@IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Restructuring &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of the shift in its focus to products like cloud
            services and data analytics, the company agreed in January to
            sell its low-end server division for $2.3 billion to Lenovo. IBM
            said it expects to send more than 7,000 workers to the Chinese
            computer maker in the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is focused on finding a joint-venture partner
            for its chip-manufacturing business after failing to attract a
            buyer for the division, two people with knowledge of the matter
            said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM was little changed at $185.17 at the close of trading
            in New York. The shares are up less than 1 percent since the
            start of Rometty's tenure at the beginning of 2012, compared
            with a 48 percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM's Watson to Help Rich DBS Clients With 'Jeopardy' Smarts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banking clients at DBS Group Holdings
            Ltd. (DBS) will soon get investing assistance from Watson, the same
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) technology that triumphed
            over human 'Jeopardy!' contestants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Singapore-based bank plans to begin using the tool,
            which can answer questions in conversational language and learn
            from responses, to aid financial planners in guiding its wealth-management unit's affluent customers, IBM
            said today. Watson
            will analyze large volumes of financial data to help DBS,
            Southeast Asia's largest lender, offer more customized service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement gives IBM a proving ground as it tries to
            show clients the value of its Watson technology. The Armonk, New
            York-based company announced today it's creating a separate
            division for Watson to spur growth after six consecutive
            quarters of falling revenue. IBM will invest more than $1
            billion in the unit, including $100 million in venture funding
            for businesses that develop applications based on the
            technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Based in New York with a staff of 2,000, the new unit will
            be separate from IBM's hardware, software and services
            divisions, said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson
            Solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's the first time that IBM is bringing together all of
            the disparate functions that support a business,' Gold said in
            an interview. 'It's a kind of doubling down.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High-Profile Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
            sales, IBM has been selling off businesses to focus on more
            profitable, faster-growing areas such as data analytics and
            cloud computing. Watson is one of its highest-profile bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By putting these parts of the business into one group, I
            can do things I couldn't do,' Michael Rhodin, who will lead
            the Watson Group as senior vice president, said in an interview
            today in New York. 'I can make decisions much, much faster on
            how to redeploy resources over new opportunities and new ideas.
            It's what the whole structure is all about -- it's about
            speed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rhodin, previously head of IBM's Software Solutions Group,
            will continue to report to fellow Senior Vice President Steve Mills, who oversees software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has stumbled amid the industrywide shift into the cloud
            era, where information is stored online instead of onsite. The
            transition has eroded demand for traditional hardware and
            spawned a new crop of competitors. To cope, IBM has spent more
            than $7.5 billion since 2010 on 43 software business
            acquisitions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Big Data &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July, the company purchased cloud-computing storage
            provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc. for about $2 billion. IBM
            will adapt Watson's technology so it can be delivered through
            SoftLayer's cloud infrastructure, it said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Watson and other big-data services, which let customers
            mine vast troves of information to make better decisions, were
            the company's biggest focus in 2013, Chief Executive Officer
            Ginni Rometty said in March. IBM boosted its expected sales from
            the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with
            an earlier forecast of $16 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $187.38 at the close
            in New York. The stock fell 2.1 percent in 2013, the year's lone
            decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Watson Group will also include an incubator for
            businesses to build on the technology, which IBM began offering
            to outside developers in November. The goal was to have three
            apps developed on the platform ready to enter the market early
            this year, the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Two-Way Street &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has received about 890 requests from programmers to
            build applications in Watson's so-called developer ecosystem,
            Rhodin said today. The company declined to comment on the number
            allowed to use the services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has to be selective in choosing clients who can use
            Watson because customers must upload large amounts of data
            before the system can work, Rhodin said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's work on both sides here,' he said. 'To even get
            started, you have to first find all of your data. For a lot of
            companies, that is proving to be harder than they thought it was
            going to be.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DBS is willing to invest S$15 million ($12 million) over
            three years in IBM's technology, and it plans to extend the
            Watson service beyond wealth management to its small-business
            and payment services, CEO Piyush Gupta said today at a briefing
            in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has collaborated on Watson-based projects with health-care organizations, including insurer
            WellPoint Inc. and
            Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The company is also
            working with Nielsen Holdings NV and Royal Bank of Canada on
            services that use Watson to interact with customers. Those first
            projects will show other potential clients Watson's promise,
            Gold said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The immediate focus is to ensure the success of those
            early engagements,' he said. 'It's a much more interactive way
            to work with clients and partners.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>DBS to Advise Wealthy Aided by IBM 'Jeopardy' Champ Watson</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banking clients at DBS Group Holdings
            Ltd. (DBS) will soon get investing assistance from Watson, the same
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) technology that triumphed
            over human 'Jeopardy!' contestants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Singapore-based bank plans to begin using the tool,
            which can answer questions in conversational language and learn
            from responses, in the second half of 2014 to aid financial
            planners in guiding its wealth-management unit's affluent
            customers, IBM said today. Watson will analyze large volumes of
            financial data to help DBS, Southeast Asia's largest lender,
            offer more customized service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement gives IBM a proving ground as it tries to
            show clients the value of its Watson technology. The Armonk, New
            York-based company announced today it's creating a separate
            division for Watson to spur growth after six consecutive
            quarters of falling revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM will invest more than $1 billion in the IBM Watson
            Group, including $100 million in venture funding for businesses
            that develop applications based on the technology. Based in New
            York with a staff of 2,000, the new unit will be separate from
            IBM's hardware, software and services divisions, said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson Solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's the first time that IBM is bringing together all of
            the disparate functions that support a business,' Gold said
            said in an interview. 'It's a kind of doubling down.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High-Profile Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
            sales, IBM has been selling off businesses to focus on more
            profitable, faster-growing areas such as data analytics and
            cloud computing. Watson is one of its highest-profile bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Rhodin, senior vice president at the IBM Software
            Solutions Group, will lead the new division, according to a
            statement today. Rhodin will continue to report to Steve Mills,
            the senior vice president for software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has stumbled amid the industrywide shift into the cloud
            era, where information is stored online instead of onsite. The
            transition has eroded demand for traditional hardware and
            spawned a new crop of competitors. To cope, IBM has spent more
            than $7.5 billion since 2010 on 43 software business
            acquisitions since 2010, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July, the company purchased cloud-computing storage
            provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc. for about $2 billion. IBM
            will adapt Watson's technology so it can be delivered through
            SoftLayer's cloud infrastructure, it said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Big Data &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Watson and other big-data services, which let customers
            mine vast troves of information to make better decisions, were
            the company's biggest focus in 2013, Chief Executive Officer
            Ginni Rometty said in March. IBM boosted its expected sales from
            the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with
            an earlier forecast of $16 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Watson Group will also include an incubator for
            businesses to build on the technology, which IBM began offering
            to outside developers in November. The goal was to have three
            apps developed on the platform ready to enter the market early

            build applications, Gold said, declining to comment on the
            number allowed to use the services. &lt;/p&gt;

            today at a briefing in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Early Engagements' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has collaborated on Watson-based projects with health-care organizations, including insurer
            WellPoint Inc. and
            Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The company is also

        <headline>IBM Granted Most U.S. Patents for 20th Straight Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) racked up more U.S. patents than any other company for the
            20th straight year, helped by increasing contributions from its
            researchers in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's 6,478 patents in 2012 mark a record for the company,
            research firm IFI Claims Patent Services said in a statement.
            South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and Tokyo-based Canon Inc. (7751)
            ranked second and third. Google Inc. took a spot in the top 50
            for the first time, with 15 more patents than Apple (AAPL) Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 30 percent of IBM's patents were produced by
            inventors outside the U.S., up from 22 percent in 2010. Research
            centers in Germany, Japan, Canada, the U.K. and Israel were
            especially productive, the Armonk, New York-based company said.
            The percentage of its patents coming from overseas is expected
            to continue growing as newer labs in Brazil and Kenya ramp up,
            said Manny Schecter, IBM's chief patent counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Intellectual property flows from where markets are
            flourishing,' he said in an interview. 'You'll see upticks in
            the amount of technology and intellectual property which we
            generate outside the U.S.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's flow of patents lets the computer-services giant
            produce about $1 billion a year in licensing revenue. The
            intellectual property also gives it the freedom to move into new
            businesses with less risk of being sued over technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Qualcomm's Bounty &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, some other technology companies get much higher
            royalty revenue from a smaller number of patents. Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM),
            a designer of mobile-phone chips, made $6.33 billion in
            technology licensing in the most recent fiscal year -- even
            though it's not in the top 10 of IFI's list. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple, whose innovations helped revolutionize computing and
            mobile phones, also isn't one of the biggest recipients of U.S.
            patents. The maker of the iPhone and iPad spends about half as
            much as IBM on research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even so, Apple did make gains in this year's list, jumping
            to No. 22 from 39th place. Google, Apple's biggest rival in
            smartphone software, rose to 21st place. Both companies are
            embroiled in lawsuits over intellectual property -- along with
            other mobile-phone makers such as Samsung -- giving them more
            incentive to increase their store of patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Broader Trend &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies are applying for more U.S. patents in general,
            Mike Baycroft, chief executive officer of Madison, Connecticut-
            based IFI, said in the statement. This year, the U.S. Patent and
            Trademark Office issued a total of 253,155 patents, a record. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, which has more than 430,000 employees worldwide,
            invests about $6 billion in RD each year. With more than 67,000
            patents since 1993, about half of which are active, it is easier
            for the company to avoid courtrooms, Schecter has said. Eight
            thousand inventors in 46 states and 35 countries contributed to
            last year's patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The latest crop of patents underscores the kinds of markets
            IBM is trying to enter. In computer security, the company has a
            patent for blocking attacks from an intruder to a network. In
            the realm of IBM's Smarter Planet initiative, the company was
            granted one patent for predicting traffic patterns using GPS in
            vehicles and another for remotely monitoring and adjusting power
            usage across an electricity grid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patents also included a technique for providing precise
            answers to natural-language questions. This is the technology
            that IBM uses for Watson, the computer that beat humans on the
            'Jeopardy!' quiz show and is now being applied to health care
            and finance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our future intellectual property strategy is a reflection
            of our business strategy,' Schecter said. 'We like being the
            leader and will continue to be very aggressive.' &lt;/p&gt;

            The Top 10 U.S. Patent Winners of 2011:
            1) IBM 6,478
            2) Samsung 5,081
            3) Canon 3,174
            4) Sony Corp. 3,032
            5) Panasonic Corp. 2,769
            6) Microsoft Corp. 2,613
            7) Toshiba Corp. 2,447
            8) Hon Hai Precision 2,013
            9) General Electric Co. 1,652
            10) LG Electronics Inc. 1,624

        <headline>IBM's Watson Agrees to Relocate to Midtown South Tower</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. agreed to lease 120,000 square feet in a new tower in
            Manhattan's East Village for its Watson Group, developer of the
            technology that beat 'Jeopardy!' champion Ken Jennings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, will bring the occupancy of
            the Fumihiko Maki-designed building at 51 Astor Place to 73
            percent, said Ed Minskoff, founder of developer Minskoff
            Equities. The 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-meter), 12-story tower was completed about four months ago,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Minskoff started construction in the aftermath of the
            credit crash without any tenants committed. The project tested
            the appetite of New York's technology and media companies for
            new offices at a time when they were flocking to converted
            factories and warehouses elsewhere in the area known as Midtown
            South, roughly from 30th to Canal streets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I always said from the day we announced we were going to
            develop this property, it would lease after people could walk
            through it,' Minskoff said in a telephone interview. 'Now that
            they're walking through it, the response from most of the people
            we're doing deals with is, 'Wow.'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the tower will be named the IBM Watson
            Building, Minskoff said. Watson is cloud-based technology that
            answers questions in plain language and learns from the
            responses. It's known for beating Jennings after he won a record
            74 straight 'Jeopardy!' matches against other humans in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lori Bosio, a spokeswoman for IBM, declined to comment on
            the lease. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Facebook, Yahoo &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Minskoff declined to reveal terms of the agreement, saying
            only that it would be for between 10 and 20 years. He said in
            general, tenants are paying rents that are 'in the range' of
            the $88 to $115 a square foot he said he was seeking in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year took space in
            buildings completed in the early 20th century. Facebook is
            leasing offices at 770 Broadway, which is across the street from
            51 Astor Place. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our entrance looks straight into their space,' Minskoff
            said. 'All that did was reinforce in my mind the value of the
            Astor Place location.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Watson's move to Manhattan was reported by Forbes on its
            website on Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Wins Most U.S. Patents for 21st Year in a Row</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) amassed more U.S. patents than any other company for
            the 21st straight year, helped by its push into big-data services, which glean insights by mining large
            quantities of information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM's 6,809 patents in 2013 scored an annual record, the
            company said today in a statement. With inventors from 41 countries, more than 31 percent of the patents
            came from overseas. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and Tokyo-based Canon Inc. (7751) ranked second
            and third. While computer-related patents can take almost three years to process, the annual list shows
            where companies are seeking growth opportunities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer
            hardware has dragged down revenue, IBM is focusing more on fast-growing areas such as analytics and cloud
            computing. Last week, IBM said it's forming a separate division for its Watson tool -- a so-called cognitive
            technology that can analyze vast amounts of data and answer questions in plain English. Bernie Meyerson,
            vice president for innovation at IBM, said the unit relies on recent patents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The work
            on cognitive is based on numerous of the patents that were just issued related to Watson,' Meyerson said in
            an interview from IBM's headquarters in Armonk, New York. 'That new division is now a major commercial
            focus. By funding research in that area, you will fund patents in that area.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) plans to invest $1.2 billion to expand its cloud services,
            bolstering a business it's counting on for growth after spending
            $2 billion last year to acquire SoftLayer Technologies Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, the world's largest provider of technology
            services, plans to add 15 new data centers worldwide by the end
            of 2014, said Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of
            SoftLayer. IBM is winding down its separate SmartCloud
            Enterprise product as early as the first quarter of this year,
            except for a premium service that will be offered along with
            SoftLayer's, he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is trying to keep up as customers shift from buying
            their own computer servers to relying on the cloud, where data
            and applications are delivered online instead of being stored
            locally. A slump in demand for hardware has contributed to six
            straight reported quarters of declining revenue, forcing the
            Armonk, New York-based company to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's the transformation that IBM is in right now,'
            Crosby said. 'That's why we are spending the money.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new investment shows that IBM views SoftLayer as one of
            its biggest bets. The price the technology giant paid to acquire
            the Dallas-based company last year was the biggest it has
            disclosed for a takeover since the purchase of software company
            Lotus Development Corp. in 1995, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Data Centers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SoftLayer has added about 2,400 customers since the
            takeover, up from about 20,000 at the time of the acquisition,
            Crosby said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM didn't specify how soon it will invest the $1.2 billion
            nor how it was budgeting for the expense. The company averages
            about $4 billion a year in capital expenditures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SoftLayer is becoming the backbone for IBM's cloud
            business, with related services being integrated with the
            platform, Crosby said. The 15 new data centers will bring the
            company's total to 40 locations in 13 countries, IBM said today
            in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is fundamental because this allows us global
            coverage,' Erich Clementi, senior vice president of global
            technology services, said in an interview. 'We are continuing
            to invest in where we think the growth areas are going to be
            over the next years.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Government Contracts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two of the centers will serve the Washington area to better
            support possible government contracts, Crosby said. While IBM
            won a cloud-computing contract of as much as $1 billion with the
            U.S. Department of the Interior last August, the industry is
            filled with new rivals eager to convert IBM's hardware customers
            into cloud users. In October, IBM abandoned a court fight over
            the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's decision to award
            Amazon.com Inc a $600 million cloud-computing contract. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM clients using SmartCloud Enterprise, its previous
            service, have already been switched to the newer product. Crosby
            said some of the employees who worked on SmartCloud Enterprise
            have moved to SoftLayer, while others have found positions
            elsewhere at IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment on whether any jobs were
            lost due to the closing of SmartCloud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM reported more than $1 billion in sales from cloud
            services last quarter, the first time it has disclosed revenue
            from that segment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            is looking into how IBM reports its revenue from the cloud
            business, the company said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Watson Division &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plans for investment in SoftLayer's cloud platform
            follows IBM's move last week to create a new business division
            around its Watson technology, which can analyze large volumes of
            data and answer questions in conversational language. IBM will
            invest more than $1 billion in the unit and give it its own
            headquarters in New York. Watson's big-data services, which let
            customers mine vast troves of information, will be run on
            SoftLayer's cloud, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM shares climbed less than 1 percent to $190.09, the
            highest since September, at the close in New York. Technology
            companies in the Standard Poor's 500 Index were little
            changed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Most U.S. Stocks Gain Amid Earnings as Coach, IBM Fall</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Most U.S. stocks rose as investors assessed earnings from companies including Norfolk Southern
            Corp., Coach (COH) Inc., International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norfolk Southern, the
            second-largest U.S. eastern railroad, climbed 4.8 percent after posting a fourth-quarter profit that
            exceeded analysts' estimates. BlackBerry Ltd. rose 8.6 percent as the smartphone maker said it plans to sell
            most of its Canadian real estate to raise cash for its turnaround plan. Coach, the largest U.S. luxury
            handbag maker, slumped 6 percent after sales missed analysts' estimates. IBM slid 3.3 percent as revenue
            declined for a seventh consecutive quarter amid weaker demand for servers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three stocks
            rose for every two that declined in the Standard Poor's 500 Index. (SPX) The U.S. equity benchmark added
            less than 0.1 percent to 1,844.86 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 41.10 points,
            or 0.3 percent, to 16,373.34 for a second day of declines. About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
            exchanges, 3 percent above the three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Earnings
            are all that matters,' Dan Morris, who helps oversee about $564 billion as global investment strategist at
            TIAA-CREF Asset Management in New York, said in a phone interview. 'To see the justification for meaningful
            higher prices, we just need to wait for earnings to catch up and accelerate a bit and that may take a
            quarter or two.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Results &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenty-five companies in the SP
            500 including Northern Trust Corp., Netflix Inc. and EBay Inc. report earnings today. Of the 86 index
            members that have posted results so far this season, 70 percent have beaten estimates for profit and 65
            percent have exceeded sales projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Per-share
            profit for companies in the benchmark probably climbed 6 percent in the fourth quarter, while sales
            increased 2.2 percent, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A five-year rally
            that lifted the SP 500 up more than 170 percent from a bear-market low has boosted equity valuations to near
            the highest level since 2009. The index trades at 15.6 times the estimated earnings of its members, more
            than the five-year average multiple of 14.1, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mixed
            Earnings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow is diverging from the SP 500 by the most in more than two years amid
            weaker results from companies such as Johnson Johnson and IBM. The average difference between their
            performance in the past three days has been 0.5 percentage point, the most since October 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Earnings have been mixed,' David Chalupnik, head of equities at Nuveen Asset Management in
            Minneapolis, said in a phone interview. His firm manages about $120 billion. 'If we as a country, we as a
            world, stay in the muted economic growth we've experienced in the past two years, the market probably can't
            support the valuations here. We need better economic numbers and we need earnings to follow that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders are buying record amounts of options that pay off if the calm that is blanketing markets
            proves temporary. Outstanding call options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) has
            reached a record 8.4 million, exceeding the previous high of 7.7 million in March, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The contracts, which expire today, are used by investors as
            insurance against losses because the VIX usually climbs when equities fall. Investors are positioning for
            stock swings with more than 180 companies in the SP 500 getting ready to release quarterly results by the
            end of next week. The VIX slid 0.2 percent today to 12.84, bringing its decline for 2014 to 6.4 percent.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Norfolk Southern &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy, consumer-discretionary and industrial
            stocks rose the most among 10 main industries in the SP 500, climbing more than 0.2 percent. Telephone and
            raw-materials companies dropped at least 0.7 percent for the worst performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norfolk
            Southern jumped 4.8 percent to $92.94. The company's profit exceeded analysts' forecast amid higher
            shipments of chemicals, automotive and agricultural products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry rose 8.6
            percent to $10.78. The company said in a statement that it will work with CBRE Group Inc. to sell vacant
            properties as well as occupied space it will then lease back from the new owners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Textron
            (TXT) Inc. advanced 5.3 percent to $38. The manufacturer of Cessna aircraft said it earned 60 cents a share
            in the fourth quarter. That beat the average analyst estimate by 1 cent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brinker
            International Inc. (EAT), which owns Chili's Grill Bar restaurants, climbed 6.5 percent to $49.72. The
            restaurant chain reported second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nuance,
            Coach &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuance Communications Inc. jumped 7.8 percent to $16.05. The provider of voice
            applications to corporate customers said first-quarter preliminary adjusted earnings per share probably
            amounted to 23 cents to 24 cents, more than the 20-cent average estimate of analysts. The company predicted
            profit of 18 cents to 21 cents a share in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coach slid 6 percent to $49.38.
            Revenue for the quarter through Dec. 28 amounted to $1.42 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of
            $1.48 billion. The maker of luxury accessories posted earnings per share of $1.06, falling short of the
            $1.11 that analysts had projected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;IBM, Motorola &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM (IBM) dropped
            3.3 percent to $182.25 for the biggest retreat in the Dow. The world's biggest computer-services provider
            said revenue declined to $27.7 billion in the three months through December. Profit dropped at the company's
            hardware unit partly because of its x86 server business, according to Chief Financial Officer Martin
            Schroeter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) slumped 12 percent to $3.67 for the biggest
            drop since October. The maker of processors for personal computers predicted that revenue will be from $1.29
            billion to $1.38 billion in the first quarter. The average analyst projection had called for sales of $1.37
            billion, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Solutions Inc. fell 3.9 percent to
            $64.51. The mobile communications company forecast first-quarter profit below analyst estimates and said it
            expects sales to decline between 4 percent and 6 percent. Analysts were predicting a 2 percent revenue gain.

        <headline>IBM Servers Drain Profit as Lenovo Gains Bargaining Power</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM)'s server business is dragging down sales and profits,
            hurting the division's value just as Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) is said
            to be considering an acquisition of the asset. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's revenue declined for a seventh straight quarter amid
            plunging demand for its x86 servers. The slump weighed on the
            hardware unit, where profit slid $750 million in the fourth
            quarter from a year earlier because of 'business model issues
            due to market shifts,' Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter
            said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo, the world's largest maker of personal computers,
            has resumed talks to acquire the x86 unit, a person with direct
            knowledge of the matter said this week. Discussions with Armonk,
            New York-based IBM had broken up in May over the price of the
            asset, then valued at $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion, and the
            unit's performance has continued to decline since. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This will increase Lenovo's negotiation power over the
            price,' Jun Zhang, an analyst with Wedge Partners Corp., said
            in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's x86 servers, which are named for a chip design used
            by Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have become a
            commodity item amid increasing competition with companies such
            as Hewlett-Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Waterfund Signs Agreement With IBM to Develop Water Cost Index</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Waterfund LLC, which provides
            financial risk management to the water industry, signed an
            agreement with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to develop
            a water cost index. Terms weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our initiative with IBM Research will finally bring real
            financial transparency to the water sector,' Chief Executive
            Officer Scott Rickards said today in a statement. By calculating
            the unsubsidized cost of freshwater production using IBM
            analytics, New York-based Waterfund can offer 'flexibly-
            tailored financial tools to investors in water infrastructure.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the United Nations, water use has been growing
            at more than twice the rate of population increase over the last
            century as urbanization and climate change accelerate demands on
            supplies. An estimated 41 percent of the world's population now
            lives in water-stressed areas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Water utilities face the most obvious financial risks from
            supply disruptions, though industries in which water
            availability is critical include the mining, beverage, chemical
            and energy sectors, Waterfund said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Predicts Success in U.S. Review of Lenovo Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) is confident the $2.3 billion purchase of its server
            unit by China's Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) will clear a U.S. national-security review, an IBM executive said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies will submit information soon on the bid to the Committee on Foreign
            Investment in the United States, Christopher Padilla, IBM's vice president for governmental programs, said
            yesterday in an interview. The inter-agency committee led by the Treasury Department reviews foreign-company
            purchases of U.S. assets for national-security concerns. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's not like this is some
            unique, choke-point technology being sold to a Chinese firm,' Padilla said by telephone. 'We're quite
            confident of a positive outcome.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Lenovo to Buy IBM Server Unit for $2.3
            Billion Amid Slump&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenovo is planning to buy IBM's x86 server business as Chinese
            investment in the U.S. expands and tensions over cyber intrusions mount between the nations, the world's two
            largest economies. Proposed deals by Chinese companies accounted for about 20 percent of the 114 reviewed by
            the panel in 2012, supplanting the U.K. as the most scrutinized nation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The IBM servers
            link computers on corporate networks and are essentially commodities in the information technology world,
            Padilla said. Most of IBM's x86 servers are being made in Shenzhen, China, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Lenovo Said to Agree to Higher Than Usual Break Fee With IBM</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) will pay
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) a fee that's more than
            double the typical size should it fail to acquire IBM's low-end
            server unit, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo agreed to pay a reverse breakup fee of 8 percent to
            9 percent of the $2.3 billion purchase price, or about $200
            million, one of the people said, asking not to be identified
            because the details are private. Such fees, where a buyer agrees
            to compensate the seller for not closing a deal, are typically
            about 3.5 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The size of the fee highlights the risk Lenovo agreed to
            bear for its largest-ever purchase ahead of a probable national-security review by the U.S. government.
            While IBM and Lenovo
            expect to clear any regulatory hurdles, they are prepared for
            the U.S. to ask for concessions before approving the
            transaction, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM demanded a higher-than-standard fee from Lenovo, saying
            it would continue discussions with prospective bidder Fujitsu
            Ltd. if the Chinese company refused to accept the terms, one
            person said. Fujitsu expressed a willingness to pay more than
            the $2.3 billion Lenovo offered, though it wasn't yet ready to
            make a firm bid, a person familiar with the matter said Jan. 24. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;McDonald's will have 8,000 employees in South Africa using
            the Connections software, IBM said today in a statement. The
            product is part of an effort to create internal networks for
            companies, letting employees use Facebook-style tools to
            communicate, sign off on documents and report expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM aims to build on the McDonald's contract by winning
            deals with other retail and food-services business. After years
            of sluggish revenue, the world's biggest computer-services
            provider sees social-networking software as a source of growth.
            The company declined to give financial terms for the contract
            with McDonald's, the largest fast-food chain by sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's really going to attract more companies,' said Sandy
            Carter, vice president of social-business strategy for Armonk,
            New York-based IBM. 'McDonald's South Africa also demonstrates
            that the power of social has moved beyond major markets into the
            emerging opportunity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After a $1.3 billion acquisition of Kenexa Corp.'s human-
            resources software last year -- along with several data-analysis
            companies -- IBM is betting its social software can compete with
            offerings from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Salesforce.com Inc. and Jive
            Software Inc. By making it easier for employees to access and
            share data, social-networking services will help IBM make $16
            billion from business analytics by 2015, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $203.07 at the close
            today in New York. The stock gained 4.2 percent last year,
            compared with a 13 percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500
            Index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM's Complaint to Twitter Leads to Patent Purchase</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Twitter Inc. (TWTR), the microblogging
            service that went public last year, agreed to buy 900 patents
            from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to gain access to new
            technology and build a defense against infringement suits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement, signed last month and announced today, also
            resolves a dispute that prompted IBM to write to Twitter last
            year about possible infringement of at least three patents.
            Financial terms weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase 'provides us with greater intellectual
            property protection and gives us freedom of action to innovate
            on behalf of all those who use our service,' Ben Lee, legal
            director for Twitter, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Twitter had nine patents and 95 pending applications before
            its initial public offering in November, far fewer than other
            leading technology companies. It said in a regulatory filing
            that the lack of intellectual property could make the company a
            target for litigation and limit its ability to fight back by
            asserting its own patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patent battles are an 'increasing distraction' for
            technology companies, even if Twitter itself wasn't facing much
            of an immediate threat, said Richard Doherty, research director
            of Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment consulting firm
            in Seaford, New York. 'At some point it becomes just a
            balancing function to take advantage of warehouses of
            intellectual property, like at IBM.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Video Delivery &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its letter to Twitter, IBM cited patents relating to a
            networking technique based on common contacts, a way to show
            advertisements without interfering with an interactive site, and
            using interconnected computers to reduce Web traffic. San
            Francisco-based Twitter also will probably gain IBM inventions
            related to things like video compression, Doherty said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As Twitter expands and starts delivering video, they need
            to increase their intellectual property portfolio,' he said.
            'We believe some know-how is going along with the patent
            transfer, not just patent numbers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patents include some that directly relate to Twitter's
            business plan. One covers a way to enable compliance with
            international shipping requirements. Twitter is seeking to get
            more revenue from retailers and is trying to make it easier for
            users to shop via its 140-character messages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Messaging Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another of the patents is for improved messaging, according
            to information posted on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
            website. Others are less clearly connected, such as a way to
            prevent damage to semiconductor chips. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Twitter, the deal marks its first patent acquisition,
            not counting intellectual property it gained by purchasing other
            companies. The companies also entered a cross-licensing
            agreement. Of the three patents cited by IBM in its initial
            letter to Twitter, only one -- for interconnected computers --
            has been assigned to Twitter, according to the patent office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Twitter gained 1.4 percent to $64.35 at 11:52
            a.m. in New York. IBM's stock was little changed at $176.37. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, which has received the most U.S. patents of any
            company for 21 straight years, has made deals with patent-light
            technology firms before. The Armonk, New York-based company has
            sold patents to Google Inc. (GOOG) to aid the Android software maker's
            battle with rivals over smartphone technology. A sale of 750
            patents to Facebook Inc. helped the social-networking site
            settle a lawsuit with Yahoo! Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It illustrates the value of patented IBM inventions and
            demonstrates our commitment to licensing access to our broad
            patent portfolio,' Ken King, general manager of intellectual
            property for IBM, said in a statement. 'We look forward to a
            productive relationship with Twitter in the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The licensing and sales deals mean IBM has agreements with
            almost every technology company in business. Its patents
            generate approximately $1 billion a year in licensing income,
            about 1 percent of its sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM to Help China Manage Air Quality, Renewable-Energy Supplies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) started a project to support China in managing air
            quality and energy consumption as well as forecasting renewable-energy supplies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under
            the project, the Armonk, New York-based company is cooperating with the Beijing municipal government on a
            system to determine the type, source and level of emissions and predict air quality in the capital, IBM said
            today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project will enable utilities to estimate the amount of
            renewable energy that will be available for grid transmission or storage, IBM said. The company is also
            developing a new system to manage energy consumption of industrial companies that represent more than 70
            percent of China's total energy consumption. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move comes as IBM seeks to counter
            declining sales in the world's second-biggest economy, where revenue fell 20 percent last quarter, dragged
            down by decreasing hardware spending. U.S. companies have also faced tensions over cybersecurity in China
            after U.S. prosecutors in May charged five Chinese military officers with allegedly hacking into computers
            of American companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China is reviewing whether domestic banks' reliance on IBM's
            high-end servers compromises the nation's financial security, Bloomberg News reported May 27 citing people
            familiar with the matter. IBM said in May it wasn't aware of any government policy recommending against use
            of its servers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest carbon emitter is paying closer attention on
            renewable energy and air quality after Premier Li Keqiang declared war on smog in a speech in March. The
            nation has pledged to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic output by as much as 45 percent from 2005
            levels before 2020. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM is helping Hengqin Island in Guangdong province to cut energy
            consumption, costs and carbon emissions, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Apple, IBM to Develop IPhone Apps for Business Customers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will work together to create
            business software for iPhone and iPad users, setting aside a three-decade-old rivalry to cater to an
            increasingly mobile workforce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM's staff will sell Apple devices to its business
            customers, and the two companies will work together to develop applications tailored to work with IBM's data
            analytics and cloud services, the companies said in a statement today. Apple also will offer
            customer-service support for the apps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The partnership helps Apple pursue a bigger slice
            of the market for corporate users of smartphones and tablets. Working with its erstwhile foe may also help
            Armonk, New York-based IBM chase other technology giants -- including Apple -- that have done a better job
            seizing on the mobile-computing boom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is a shot in the arm for IBM and a great
            validation of Apple in the enterprise space, where they already are a huge success,' Aaron Levie, chief
            executive officer of cloud-storage company Box Inc., said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the
            deal, Apple gains a large sales force that will push its mobile devices to companies, while IBM, whose sales
            have been stagnating, adds the cachet of being partners with one of the best known and most popular
            consumer-electronics brands. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Apple Puts IBM Rivalry to Rest With Corporate Sales Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) are putting aside a rivalry
            started at the dawn of the personal-computing era to get more businesses to embrace iPhones and iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal unveiled yesterday gives Apple access to an IBM sales force that will recommend Apple's
            devices to customers in industries such as health care and banking, which have never been priorities for the
            consumer-focused iPhone maker. IBM gets a boost in a long-running effort to sell software and services to
            companies seeking to manage workers' smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We really recognized
            almost simultaneously that we could be uniquely helpful to one another's strategy and that there was
            literally no overlap,' Bridget Van Kralingen, IBM's senior vice president of global business services, said
            in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The partnership helps Apple pursue a bigger slice of the market for
            corporate users of wireless devices. While many businesses allow the use of iPhones and iPads for checking
            e-mail and other tasks, some longtime users of PCs running Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Windows software have
            remained reluctant to adopt its gadgets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Contracts Most Expensive Since 2005 as Sales Slump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Options (IBM) traders are paying the most
            since 2005 to protect against stock swings in International
            Business Machines Corp. relative to its peers on concern profit
            will trail analyst estimates for a second quarter as sales drop. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Implied volatility for contracts with an exercise price
            closest to the company's stock was 1.44 times the Technology
            Select Sector SPDR Fund, the highest since September 2005,
            according to three-month data compiled by Bloomberg. IBM shares
            have slumped 8.6 percent over the past three months, the most in
            the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has pushed the
            company into faster-growing markets like data analysis and
            repurchased shares, IBM is contending with sluggish demand for
            hardware and consulting work. IBM missed earnings estimates in
            April for the first time in eight years and will probably say
            today that second-quarter revenue fell 2 percent, based on
            analysts' estimates tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You've got to meet these earnings numbers, otherwise you
            get penalized,' Edward Painvin, chief investment officer of
            Chase Investment Counsel Corp., said by phone from
            Charlottesville, Virginia, on July 15. His firm oversees $500
            million and doesn't own IBM shares. 'It's difficult to do for a
            name of this size with very, very little top line growth.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Sales Top Estimates as Rometty Moves Toward Profit Goals</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM)'s second-quarter sales topped analysts' estimates, getting
            Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty closer to her profit
            goals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While revenue fell 2 percent from a year earlier to $24.4
            billion -- the ninth straight quarterly drop -- declines for
            products like mainframe servers and markets such as Brazil and
            China were less severe than earlier this year, IBM said today in
            a statement. The result surpassed the $24.1 billion that
            analysts projected on average, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings rose to $4.32 a share, 1 cent
            higher than analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rometty is banking on a strong second half of the year to
            hit her targets for the company's performance even as IBM adapts
            to an industrywide shift to cloud computing, an area that
            expanded 50 percent in the first six months of the year from the
            same period in 2013. The company reiterated its projection for
            2014 adjusted earnings of at least $18 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is contending with technology customers that
            increasingly seek to store data and software on cloud-computing
            networks, rather than on site. That's limited clients' need for
            IBM's servers and mainframes, making it more difficult to reach
            profit targets. The company had said before today that it
            expected mainframe sales to improve into next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM aims to reach $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
            up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a pledge instated by former Chief
            Executive Officer Sam Palmisano and sustained by Rometty, who
            succeeded him in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Armonk, New York-based IBM fell 1.4 percent in
            late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Profit Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To meet this year's projections, Chief Financial Officer
            Martin Schroeter said in April that IBM would be 38 percent
            toward its profit goal by the end of the second quarter. That
            implied second-quarter earnings this year of $4.21 to $4.39 a
            share, compared with the $4.32 a share reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue from emerging markets slid 7 percent in the second
            quarter, compared to an 11 percent fall in the three months
            prior. Sales to Brazil, Russia, India and China also pared
            losses, declining 2 percent, compared with an 11 percent drop
            last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Chinese Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has faced difficulties in the Chinese market as
            tensions over cyberhacking have risen between China and the U.S.
            The Chinese government is reviewing whether domestic banks'
            reliance on high-end servers from IBM compromises the nation's
            financial security, people familiar with the matter said in May.
            IBM said then that it wasn't aware of any government policy
            recommending against use of its servers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of mainframe servers, the workhorse machines
            corporate customers have used for decades to run their crucial
            computing tasks, decreased 1 percent -- an improvement from the
            40 percent decline in the first quarter. IBM had said it
            expected those sales to improve because more customers were
            preparing to upgrade their mainframes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Rometty tries to navigate the company through the
            industry's changes, she has shifted IBM's own focus to cloud
            services, along with data analytics, in which the company helps
            clients mine the digital information they collect to identify
            trends. Rometty has also tried to offload less profitable
            businesses -- like the low-end server unit that Lenovo Group
            Ltd. agreed to buy for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national-security review. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Watson Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a deal unveiled this week, IBM will help develop more
            than 100 mobile-centric applications for businesses catered to
            Apple Inc.'s iPhones and iPads to help workers do more with the
            devices than check e-mail or calendars. The companies foresee
            corporate customers increasingly using handheld devices for
            daily workplace tasks like supply chain management and human
            resources functions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, IBM is spending more than $1 billion to create
            a new group around its Watson technology, which lets customers
            use plain English to analyze large troves of data. To remake its
            cloud business, Rometty bought provider SoftLayer Technologies
            Inc. in 2013 for $2 billion and this year committed an
            additional $1.2 billion to bolster its data centers and
            offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Their success is going to be tied to the cloud over the
            next five to 10 years,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR
            Capital Markets. 'It's more of a strategic focus of the
            company.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cloud Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cloud offerings delivered as a service are now at an annual
            run rate of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion as of the
            first quarter. That's still a fraction of IBM's total $100
            billion in revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As it reshapes itself, IBM will still have to rely on its
            older global business services and software units, which
            together make up about three-quarters of sales. To boost
            earnings in the meantime, Rometty has also sold debt to fund
            share buybacks, laid off workers and slashed the company's tax
            rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM ended the quarter with $9.7 billion in cash on hand,
            even with the end of March, after spending $1.1 billion on
            dividends and $3.7 billion on share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $4.1 billion, or $4.12 a share, from
            $3.2 billion, or $2.91 a share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Boosts Annual Forecast After Earnings Beat Estimates</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services company, raised its annual
            forecast after second-quarter earnings topped analysts'
            estimates, lifted by cost cuts and share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Excluding a $1 billion restructuring expense, profit was
            $3.91 a share last quarter, the Armonk, New York-based company
            said yesterday in a statement. That beat the $3.78 that analysts
            projected on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            IBM now expects to earn at least $16.90 a share in 2013, up from
            the $16.70 it forecast earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has managed to increase profit by shifting away from
            low-margin businesses, cutting jobs and repurchasing stock --
            even as revenue declines. The company is betting that faster-growing areas such as cloud computing and data
            analysis can
            offset a broader slowdown in information-technology spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have to take them at their word that they're going to
            see some productivity improvements due to the workforce changes,
            and some strength in software and services,' said Josh Olson,
            an analyst with Edward Jones Co. in Des Peres, Missouri.
            'They're getting a benefit from software growing at a faster
            pace than the other businesses, and that's contributing to the
            profit beat.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares climbed 1.8 percent to $197.99 at the close in
            New York. The stock is up 3.4 percent this year, trailing an 18
            percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earlier Shortfall &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By beating earnings estimates, IBM rebounds from a rare
            stumble in the previous quarter, when its profit missed
            projections for the first time in eight years. Even so, revenue
            continued to decline, falling 3.3 percent to $24.9 billion from
            a year earlier. Analysts had expected $25.3 billion. Sales
            declined in every IBM business division other than software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to a slump in demand, currency changes took a
            toll on IBM's results last quarter. In Japan, where the company
            made about 10 percent of its sales last year, the yen fell 5
            percent versus the dollar in the second quarter. The company was
            'significantly impacted' by the yen's weakness, Chief
            Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because our business in Japan is more heavily skewed to
            local services, we have less ability to hedge cross-border cash
            flows as compared to most other countries,' Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Intel, Accenture &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other technology companies are suffering as well. Intel
            Corp., the world's largest chipmaker, reported its fourth
            straight revenue decline yesterday as customers shunned personal
            computers, choosing tablets and smartphones instead. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc (ACN), the world's largest technology-consulting
            company after IBM, gave a sales forecast last month that missed
            analysts' estimates. Accenture blamed customers deferring
            decisions on long-term contracts. Oracle Corp. (ORCL), meanwhile, has
            missed sales estimates for two straight quarters, hurt by
            slumping hardware revenue and a shift by customers to
            applications delivered online. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM said today that one recent deal with UniCredit SpA is
            indicative of how it aims to transform its business. The 10-year
            outsourcing deal, worth multiple billions, will employ analytics
            and cloud computing to devise new ways for the bank to do
            business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM prioritizes earnings over revenue growth in its five-year road map, which is targeting profit
            of $20 a share by 2015,
            up from the $15.25 earned last year. The plan calls for a
            combination of buybacks, acquisitions and investments in faster-growing markets to reach that goal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Shakeup &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following the previous quarter's earnings shortfall, Chief
            Executive Officer Ginni Rometty shook up the management of IBM's
            struggling hardware division. She replaced Rod Adkins with Tom Rosamilia, who had been overseeing corporate
            strategy. That
            division saw a 12 percent decrease in sales last quarter, an
            improvement from the 17 percent drop in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM also embarked on a restructuring program last quarter,
            cutting jobs globally. More than 3,300 workers were dismissed in
            the U.S. and Canada alone, according to Alliance@IBM, an
            employee group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said in April that divestitures would help
            offset the $1 billion cost of the restructuring. At the time,
            IBM was in talks to sell parts of its server division to Lenovo
            Group Ltd. (992), according to people familiar with the discussions.
            The negotiations broke down in early May due to disagreements
            over price, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Active Discussions' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday the company said it was reducing its expectations
            for second-half gains from a divestiture. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The substantial second-half gain that we were counting on
            in our view of EPS will not likely close at the end of this
            year, but we're still in active discussions,' Loughridge said.
            'We have a very disciplined MA process. We're not going to
            underprice or rush a divestiture simply to close within 2013.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income fell 17 percent to $3.23 billion,
            or $2.91 a share, from $3.88 billion, or $3.34, a year earlier.
            The company paid $1 billion in dividends and made $3.6 billion
            in stock buybacks in the period, boosting earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is seeing growth in high-margin businesses and
            bookings look promising, Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're exiting the quarter stronger than we entered,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM's Nine-Quarter Sales Slump Overshadows Cloud Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) reported a ninth straight quarter of declining sales as
            demand fell for hardware and computer services, underscoring the urgency of its plan to get more revenue
            from newer businesses like cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter revenue dropped 2 percent
            from a year earlier to $24.4 billion, compared with the $24.1 billion that analysts projected on average,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings rose to $4.32 a share, 1 cent higher than
            analysts' estimates, boosted by cost-cutting and share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer
            Ginni Rometty is betting that businesses want to store their data and software applications remotely, in the
            cloud, and they need IBM to help mine the piles of data they're accumulating. She's preaching patience to
            investors, plying them with share repurchases to persuade them to wait for an inflection point where the new
            technology can propel the company back in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's become more of a
            show-me story,' Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones Co., said. 'It leaves investors to gauge how much
            faith they have in IBM's ability to execute. At some point, investors look at the quality of earnings and
            would like to see business momentum at its core franchises.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cloud Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company maintained its forecasts for $18 a share in adjusted earnings this year and $20 a share
            next year. Part of that expansion is predicated on the growth of cloud computing sales, which grew 50
            percent in the first six months of the year from the same period in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cloud
            offerings delivered as a service are now at an annual run rate of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion
            as of the first quarter. That's still a fraction of IBM's total $100 billion in revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There were signs of improvement in areas where IBM had been struggling. Sales to Brazil, Russia,
            India and China pared losses, declining 2 percent, compared with an 11 percent drop last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of mainframe servers, the workhorse machines corporate customers have used for decades to run
            their crucial computing tasks, decreased 1 percent -- an improvement from the 40 percent decline in the
            first quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of Armonk, New York-based IBM were little changed at $192.50 at
            the close in New York. Global services sales, which typically make up more than half of IBM's business, slid
            1 percent to $13.9 billion. Software revenue was up 1 percent from a year earlier to $6.5 billion, a
            slowdown from 2 percent growth in the prior quarter. And even with the improvement in the mainframe
            business, total hardware sales dropped 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Licensing Model &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When
            companies move to cloud computing, software and data can be stored on remote servers, instead of installed
            on premise. In the past, many software offerings were sold to customers in a licensing model, where clients
            pay upfront for the right to use the tools for an allotted amount of time. With cloud-based services, many
            offerings are pay-as-you-use, giving customers the opportunity to be more efficient and lower the total
            payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While IBM's cloud business is growing, the fear is that it could take revenue
            away from its traditional sales model, said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'How much of that is new wins and how much is cannibalistic? You don't know how much of that is
            coming from cannibalizing their own software versus net new stuff,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Services
            revenue, meanwhile, has been hurt as customers put pressure on IBM to lower its fees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Pricing
            Pressure' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our performance continues to reflect pricing pressure and client contract
            renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects,' IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter
            said about the company's outsourcing business on the earnings conference call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM's
            contract signings for services -- an indicator of expected future revenue -- fell 33 percent from a year
            earlier to $11 billion, driven by declines in new business for consulting and outsourcing. That falls short
            of the 6.2 percent gain from rival Accenture Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fall in contract signings could
            drag on IBM's services revenue in the second half of the year, said Anurag Rana, an analyst for Bloomberg
            Industries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before results were released yesterday, IBM shares had climbed 2.6 percent
            this year, supported by the company's repurchases, which brought the number of shares in circulation under 1
            billion at the end of June -- the first time they've been below that threshold at the close of a quarter
            since at least 1999. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More Buybacks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM ended the quarter with $9.7
            billion in cash on hand, little changed from the end of March, after spending $1.1 billion on dividends and
            $3.7 billion on share buybacks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $4.1 billion, or $4.12 a share,
            from $3.2 billion, or $2.91 a share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Rometty tries to shift IBM's own
            focus to cloud services and data analytics, she has also tried to offload less profitable businesses -- like
            the low-end server unit that Lenovo Group Ltd. agreed to buy for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S.
            national-security review. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple Deal &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a deal unveiled this week,
            IBM will help develop more than 100 mobile-centric applications for businesses catered to Apple Inc.'s
            iPhones and iPads to help workers do more with the devices than check e-mail or calendars. The companies
            foresee corporate customers increasingly using handheld devices for daily workplace tasks like supply chain
            management and human resources functions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Separately, IBM is spending more than $1
            billion to create a new group around its Watson technology, which lets customers use plain English to
            analyze large troves of data. To remake its cloud business, Rometty bought SoftLayer Technologies Inc. in
            2013 for $2 billion and this year committed an additional $1.2 billion to bolster its data centers and
            offerings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Their success is going to be tied to the cloud over the next five to 10
            years,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. 'It's more of a strategic focus of the

        <headline>IBM Introduces Watson to Consumers in Service for USAA Clients</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) is putting its Watson natural-language technology to the
            test with consumers on a wide scale for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On the website of financial-services firm USAA, military
            customers will be able to use IBM's tool to ask questions and
            seek advice on transitioning back to civilian life. Famous for
            being a 'Jeopardy!' game-show champion, Watson analyzes
            information and can answer questions in conversational English. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The USAA deal gives IBM its biggest test yet of whether
            consumers will embrace Watson, a technology that's become a
            bigger focus of the company's investments and marketing. IBM
            sees data analytics tools like Watson as a source of growth to
            counter declining demand for hardware that has led to nine
            straight quarters of falling sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Traditional methods of providing advice and information
            aren't scaling,' John Gordon, vice president of IBM's Watson
            Group, said in an interview. 'This is a fundamentally different
            approach.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Watson has previously been available to consumers in
            some limited tests, such as a mobile application for home cooks,
            this is the first service to be widely available, Gordon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM and USAA, based in San Antonio, worked for about nine
            months to develop the tool to answer questions specific to
            customers leaving the military, like whether to seek out
            veteran's benefits or how to buy a home, said Eric Engquist,
            assistant vice president of military transitions at USAA. More
            than 150,000 military members transfer to civilian life a year,
            Engquist said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Behavior Change &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While persuading customers to turn to a technology for life
            coaching will 'certainly' require a change in behavior, the
            tool could give customized, 24-hour access that wasn't possible
            with USAA's website or its employees, Engquist said. It could
            also be a test for expanding Watson's use more broadly at USAA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As sluggish demand for computer servers has hurt sales, IBM
            has focused on more profitable, faster-growing areas such as
            data analytics and cloud computing while selling hardware
            businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, IBM boosted its expected sales from the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015,
            compared with an
            earlier forecast of $16 billion. The company said in January
            that it will spend $1 billion to create a new division around
            Watson to help spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;IBM will store data and software on remote servers in a
            service called CalCloud, available to all state and local
            government bodies, the company said today in a statement. The
            arrangement lets agencies pay only for the computing workload
            they need. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is counting on cloud computing for growth after nine
            straight quarters of declining revenue, dragged down by weak
            demand for hardware and falling sales in markets like China.
            Cloud technology has been a conundrum for the Armonk, New York-based company because it can reduce demand
            for hardware, since
            companies rent computing power rather than assembling their own
            data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company competes for cloud-computing clients with
            Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., to which IBM
            lost a $600 million contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence
            Agency last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Because government customers have additional data-security
            needs, they've been slower than corporations in moving to the
            cloud because it means surrendering some control over managing
            the technology. IBM said it designed CalCloud to comply with the
            requirements of the Internal Revenue Service, Social Security
            and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'CalCloud is an important step towards providing faster
            and more cost-effective IT services to California state
            departments and ultimately to the citizens of California,'
            Marybel Batjer, secretary of the Government Operations Agency,
            said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Said to Reject Globalfoundries Offer for Chip Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)'s talks to sell its money-losing chip-manufacturing
            operations to Globalfoundries Inc. have ended after the two companies failed to agree on terms, according to
            people familiar with the process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Globalfoundries, owned by an investment arm of the
            government of Abu Dhabi, made an offer that was rejected by IBM as too low, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the negotiations are private. James Sciales, a spokesman for IBM, and Kevin
            Kimball, a spokesman for Santa Clara, California-based Globalfoundries, both declined to comment on
            speculation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The breakdown of the talks is a setback for IBM Chief Executive Officer
            Ginni Rometty as she attempts to meet 2015 earnings goals by shedding less profitable units and reversing
            nine straight quarters of revenue declines. Globalfoundries, which has its own plant in New York state, had
            placed little or no value on IBM's factories because they are too old, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM
            shares fell 0.4 percent to $194.40 at the close in New York. The stock has risen 3.6 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last month, Bloomberg News reported that Globalfoundries was primarily interested in acquiring
            IBM's engineers and intellectual property rather than manufacturing facilities, according to people with
            knowledge of the matter. Globalfoundries would have acted as a supplier for IBM's microprocessors, the
            people said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM, AT&amp;amp;T Build Technology to Move Data Fast in Disaster</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When hurricanes come barreling toward land, people, airplanes and ships are relocated to avoid
            destruction. Now some of the world's biggest technology companies are making advances in figuring out how to
            quickly move large amounts of critical data and software out of harm's way, too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ATT
            Inc. (T), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), and Applied Communications Sciences have created a
            prototype technology to reduce the time needed to connect remote networks from days to seconds. Part of a
            seven-year program from the U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the latest
            innovation from the partnership could allow large amounts of information and software to be more quickly
            shifted between private and public data centers, as well as between cloud services from different providers.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moving data and software to another location could be crucial in coping with events like
            natural disasters and terrorist attacks as governments and companies have become increasingly reliant on
            servers, both on premise and in remote locations, to handle their information. The U.S. Department of
            Defense has expressed interest in the research, IBM said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The key idea
            here is to have a highly dynamic backbone network,' said Adel Saleh, a research professor in electrical and
            computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a former DARPA project manager. 'If
            the network is under physical attack or cyberattack, you can recover from this quickly.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Remaining
            Hurdles &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many companies and governments already keep data remotely to have
            redundant systems, the companies' prototype would let them reconfigure on the fly to handle changes in
            needs, such as computing bandwidth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ability to use capacity only when needed could
            also make cloud computing less expensive, Saleh said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            partnership between ATT, IBM and ACS is a part of a DARPA program called Coronet that was started in 2007 to
            protect networks against catastrophic failures, in order to help keep the Internet and government services
            up and running. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technology is still in the proof-of-concept phase, said Dave
            McQueeney, vice president of computing as a service at IBM Research. Changes would have to be made to
            optical fiber networks -- including the addition of new switches -- for it to be adopted more broadly, he
            said. Work also needs to be done within cloud systems to accommodate the connections, McQueeney said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If these changes are made, the technology could be used in military technology infrastructures and
            eventually for commercial use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Every client I talk to doesn't want to put all of their
            IT in one place,' McQueeney said. 'One of the long poles of the tent that needed to get solved was very,
            very rapid provisioning of huge amounts of bandwidth. Now we can have a vision of a multiple-cloud, hybrid
            environment where the networking is likely not the main bottleneck.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), the largest computer-services provider, raised $2.15
            billion in a two-part bond sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The information technology business issued $650 million of
            two-year floating-rate notes to yield 3 basis points more than
            the three-month London interbank offered rate and $1.5 billion
            of 3.375 percent, fixed-rate securities due 2023 priced to yield
            83 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds, the first to be
            offered by the company since May 2, may be rated Aa3 by Moody's
            Investors Service, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's $1 billion of 1.875 percent, 10-year debentures,
            which it issued in July 2012 to yield 65 basis points more than
            government bonds, traded on July 25 at 89.99 cents on the dollar
            to yield 3.16 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
            reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Morgan Stanley managed the offering for the Armonk, New

        <headline>IBM Defends Cloud-Computing Accounting Amid SEC Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            investigation into how it reports revenue from offsite cloud services, said it stands by its accounting
            methods. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM is cooperating with the SEC in the probe, which it learned about in May, it
            said today in a filing. The company books its revenue from cloud services, such as storing customers' data
            and software applications remotely, under generally accepted accounting principles, said Ed Barbini, a
            spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'IBM's reporting of cloud revenue is the
            result of a rigorous and disciplined process, and we are confident that the information we have provided has
            been consistently accurate,' Barbini said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has
            identified cloud computing as one of IBM's chief sources of growth amid a slowdown in demand for hardware
            and for consulting services. The investigation at the company, known for consistently meeting analysts'
            earnings estimates, underscores confusion about how cloud revenue should be booked, said Michael Cusumano, a
            management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a murky area where the rules aren't really established,' Cusumano said. 'Companies treat
            cloud-computing revenue in different ways.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About half of publicly traded software
            companies since 1990 have had to restate revenue because of misclassification of sales and product returns,
            or because they categorized ongoing payments for tech-support services as a sale of a product license,
            Cusumano said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Disciplined Process' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While IBM doesn't disclose
            its revenue from cloud services, it said the sales rose 70 percent in the first half of 2013 from a year
            earlier. In its filing today, the company didn't provide details on what information the SEC was seeking.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'IBM has robust systems and controls to identify and validate what products and services
            count as cloud revenue,' Barbini said. 'IBM accounts for cloud transactions exactly the same way as it would
            account for those transactions if they were not cloud -- in accordance with GAAP.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Florence
            Harmon, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM has beat analysts' earnings
            expectations in 32 of the past 33 quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the other hand, it
            has missed sales estimates in seven of the past eight quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More Probes? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigation may be the first in a series of probes into companies in the same industry as the
            SEC tries to clear up confusion and differences in standards, said Jack Ciesielski, owner of investment firm
            R.G. Associates Inc. in Baltimore and the publisher of the Analyst's Accounting Observer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            company has a goal of reaching $7 billion in cloud revenue by 2015, with about $3 billion from new business
            and the rest from current contracts shifting over to the cloud category. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM's 70
            percent growth rate for cloud-computing services in the first six months of 2013 was a slowdown from 80
            percent last year. IBM has also said cloud revenue, which is spread across several divisions, tripled in
            2011 from 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 1 percent to $195.04 at the close in New York. The stock
            has gained 1.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disclosure of the probe comes days after IBM won
            court approval for a $10 million settlement with the SEC for accusations of bribery in China and South
            Korea. IBM said earlier this year it's the subject of a U.S. Justice Department bribery investigation
            related to contracts in Poland, Argentina, Bangladesh and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Autonomy Writedown
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), IBM's archrival in the computer-services business, took an
            $8.8 billion charge last year to write down the value of Autonomy, a software company it acquired, amid
            allegations of accounting improprieties within the unit. Autonomy, whose products organize corporate
            customers' data, had used aggressive tactics to inflate its results, a former executive told Bloomberg News
            last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, IBM acquired SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a
            cloud-computing storage provider. IBM paid almost $2 billion for Dallas-based SoftLayer, according to a
            person familiar with the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Market researcher IDC estimates the cloud-computing
            market may more than double to $105 billion by 2016 from last year. SoftLayer specializes in public clouds
            -- data-center networks that manage computing and software for businesses remotely. IBM is pairing those
            capabilities with private-cloud operations, building dedicated systems for individual customers. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A new rule requiring U.S. companies to report information about their suppliers was designed to
            discourage them from doing business with mines controlled by armed thugs in Africa. But the conflict-mineral
            filings show a startling trend happening in another continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 1,277 U.S.
            companies that reported before yesterday's deadline, 68 listed the Central Bank of the DPRK in their filings
            with the Securities and Exchange Commission. DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ' as
            in North Korea, as in the country run by a 31-year-old dictator who had his uncle killed last year just to
            prove a point. The U.S. has had economic sanctions against North Korea since 1950, and the United Nations
            maintains sanctions of its own to deter further development of nuclear weapons there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claigan
            Environmental, a corporate-compliance firm, compiled the data showing dozens of companies listing North
            Korea's central bank as a supplier and shared its findings with Bloomberg. International Business Machines
            and Hewlett-Packard were among those reporting that North Korea was in their supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In
            January, upon learning that the Central Bank of DPRK may be used by a small number of HP suppliers, we took
            immediate action to launch investigations," said Michael Thacker, a spokesman for HP. "To date, the
            information we have received indicates no minerals obtained from Central Bank of DPRK were included in HP
            products."&lt;/p&gt;

            Corp. (IBM), the world's largest seller of computer services, agreed
            to buy SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a cloud-computing storage
            provider that will help it compete with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is paying almost $2 billion for Dallas-based SoftLayer,
            according to a person familiar with the deal, who declined to be
            named because the financial terms aren't being released.
            SoftLayer had $335 million in revenue in 2012, Chief Executive
            Officer Lance Crosby said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM plans to add SoftLayer to its SmartCloud unit to create
            a new Cloud Services division to capitalize on a market that
            researcher IDC estimates may more than double to $105 billion by
            2016 from last year. SoftLayer specializes in public clouds --
            data-center networks that manage computing and software for

            &lt;p&gt;Starting a new division through acquisition 'allows us to
            get focused,' said Ric Telford, IBM's vice president of cloud
            services. 'It's all about acceleration. We had been building
            out but we saw SoftLayer and the acquisition was too compelling

        <headline>IBM Wins Shanghai Airport Cloud-Computing Contract</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
            won a contract with China's state-owned Shanghai Airport
            Authority to use cloud computing to help move traffic more
            efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IBM system, the first phase of which was completed in
            March, helps the airport manage everything from airplane taxi
            times to passengers waiting on a concourse, the Armonk, New
            York-based company said in a statement today. The system
            dramatically improved the punctuality of flight departures,
            according to the statement, which didn't provide specific
            figures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contract gives IBM a boost as it seeks to reverse
            declining sales in China, where revenue fell 20 percent last
            quarter, dragged down by declining hardware spending. U.S.
            companies have also been grappling with tensions over
            cybersecurity in China after U.S. prosecutors last month charged
            five Chinese military officers with allegedly hacking into
            computers of American companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China is reviewing whether domestic banks' reliance on
            IBM's high-end servers compromises the nation's financial
            security, Bloomberg News reported May 27 citing people familiar
            with the matter. IBM said last month it wasn't aware of any
            government policy against use of its servers. The company's
            Shanghai-based spokesman Anthony Guerrieri said today's
            announcement is unrelated to any government reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shanghai Airport &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are proud to be selected by Shanghai Hongqiao
            International Airport as its trusted partner,' Ernie Hu, IBM's
            vice president for its software group in China, said in the
            statement. 'IBM has a long history of innovation in
            transportation, working with the world's leading airlines and
            airports.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM was little changed at $184.23 at 10:10 a.m. in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The system supplied to the Shanghai Airport Authority,
            which operates the city's Pudong International Airport and
            Hongqiao International Airport, features IBM's DB2 data server,
            and the Tivoli Directory Server and Security Identity Manager,
            according to IBM's statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter has said the
            company's challenges in China are related to the normal cycle of
            upgrades for hardware such as servers. While IBM doesn't break
            out sales figures by country, 14 percent of its 2013 revenue
            came from the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Wins Part of Protest Over $600 Million CIA Contract</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
            won a key part of a protest over the Central Intelligence
            Agency's cloud-computing contract with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates
            federal contract disputes, today sustained Armonk, New York-based IBM's challenge of the four-year award,
            which has a
            maximum value of $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The GAO recommended that the CIA reopen negotiations with
            the companies and amend the solicitation 'if necessary,' said
            Ralph White, the office's managing associate general counsel for
            procurement law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The intelligence agency failed to properly evaluate prices
            and waived one contract requirement only for Amazon, according
            to the GAO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The GAO denied IBM's assertion that the CIA failed to
            properly evaluate Amazon's past performance, including service
            outages that occurred in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM filed the protest Feb. 26. The full decision wasn't
            publicly released. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We now anticipate the reopening of the contract proposal
            process,' said Clint Roswell, an IBM spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials with the CIA and Amazon didn't immediately
            respond to calls and e-mails seeking comment about today's
            decision. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM-Epic Team to Vie for $11 Billion Pentagon IT System</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), the world's biggest computer services provider, and Epic
            Systems Corp. will team up to compete for an $11 billion project
            to manage U.S. troops' electronic health records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM announced its plans to bid today, even before the
            Defense Department formally starts the competition for the
            information-technology system. Rival bids may come from
            Accenture Plc (ACN) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The winner gets one of the biggest opportunities in federal
            information technology, where new projects are under scrutiny
            after the flawed rollout of the Obamacare website. A better
            Pentagon system is needed so troops' health records can be
            shared quickly with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is
            struggling to reduce backlogs in disability claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I hope people expect results, because this is where we
            show up,' Andy Maner, managing partner for IBM's U.S. federal
            division, said in a phone interview. 'We don't bid on
            everything, but when we do, we want to change the world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pentagon's solicitation for the contract, possibly with
            a 10-year duration, may be posted as early as next month, Maner
            said. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, already has more than 100
            employees working to develop a proposal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This has been a thing we've had circled for more than
            three years,' Maner said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Website Fixes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contract may attract bids from companies such as
            Dublin-based Accenture and Falls Church, Virginia-based
            Northrop, according to Brian Friel, a Bloomberg Industries
            analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government this year turned to Accenture for help
            fixing healthcare.gov, the enrollment website for the federal
            health-care overhaul. The company succeeds Montreal-based CGI
            Group Inc. (GIB/A), criticized for the website's early troubles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other competitors for the Pentagon program might include
            Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Reston,
            Virginia-based Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS), Friel said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Northrop built the original system, which is now being
            maintained by Leidos, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The planned system, which will replace the older one, will
            track U.S. forces' health records no matter where they receive
            care, whether on base, on a ship, in a military hospital or
            close to combat. It will handle the health records of 9.7
            million beneficiaries, including active-duty military, retirees
            and their dependents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Epic's Software &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Service members, their families and health-care providers
            who care for them deserve the best health care our country can
            provide,' Carl Dvorak, president of Verona, Wisconsin-based
            Epic, said in a statement. 'They would benefit from an
            integrated system that leverages best practices from other large
            and successful health-care organizations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Epic's enterprise software is widely used in the health-care industry, including by Johns Hopkins
            Medicine, Kaiser
            Permanente and the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM and Epic have worked together on other health-care
            projects, including for Kaiser. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM was the 51st biggest federal contractor in the fiscal
            year that ended Sept. 30, receiving $1.2 billion in prime, or
            direct, awards, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            company ranked 45th in 2012, when it had $1.5 billion in U.S.
            contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IBM-Epic collaboration will be led by Keith Salzman, a
            former Army hospital chief medical information officer who is
            now IBM's chief medical information officer, and use technology
            from its Watson supercomputer, best known for beating human
            contestants on the 'Jeopardy!' TV game show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Claims Backlog &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have
            been pressured by lawmakers, White House officials and veterans
            to help fix the VA's backlog in processing disability claims.
            The military has contributed to that bottleneck, some lawmakers
            and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pentagon announced in May 2013 that it would build its
            own electronic health-records system. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to work with the VA to develop
            a 'seamless
            system.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The military's plan raised concerns among lawmakers and
            veterans' organizations that had pushed the two agencies to
            build a single system for current and former troops' health
            records. &lt;/p&gt;

            joined with Epic Systems Corp. to compete for an $11 billion project to manage U.S. troops' electronic

            'unmatched depth and breadth of experience' in commercial and government electronic health-record systems,
            Melissa Koskovich, a Leidos spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today when asked about the prospect of seeking
            the contract. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We look forward to the opportunity to respond to the needs of this
            important program,' she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The contract might also attract bids from companies such
            as Dublin-based Accenture, Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop, and Palo Alto, California-based

        <headline>IBM Said to Start U.S. Job Cuts Today Amid Global Reduction</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), the world's largest computer-services provider, began
            cutting U.S. jobs today as part of a global restructuring plan
            announced in April, a person familiar with the move said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reduction targets employees with a range of seniority,
            from rank-and-file staff to executives, said the person, who
            asked not to be named because the information is private. Some
            U.S. workers began to receive notifications of the cuts last
            night, according to Lee Conrad, a coordinator for Alliance@IBM,
            an employee group. The restructuring will cost $1 billion
            worldwide, including severance expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM announced the job-cutting effort after releasing
            disappointing first-quarter results in April. The Armonk, New
            York-based company posted profit of $3 a share in the period,
            missing the $3.05 predicted by analysts -- the first earnings
            shortfall since 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            IBM said at the time that the job reduction would be
            concentrated overseas and mostly complete by the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is probably cutting 6,000 to 8,000 jobs
            globally, based on the $1 billion cost figure, said Laurence Balter, an analyst at Oracle Investment
            Research in Fox Island,
            Washington. That would represent less than 2 percent of IBM's
            total workforce of 434,246 as of Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;

            at least 1,300 workers in a round of U.S. job cuts that began
            yesterday, according to the employee group Alliance@IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The job reduction includes at least 222 people in marketing
            for the software business and 165 in semiconductor research and
            development, according to Lee Conrad, a coordinator for
            Alliance@IBM, which is affiliated with the Communications
            Workers of America union. &lt;/p&gt;

            Carolina; Burlington, Vermont; Austin, Texas; and New York's
            Hudson Valley. 'Everything's getting hit.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company posted profit of $3 a

            beyond the traditional model of doing business with chief
            information officers. &lt;/p&gt;

            of marketing, supply chain, human resources and others, changing
            the way it sells software as competition from Silicon Valley
            startups mounts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's the company's second big move into cloud delivery this
            month, following the purchase of SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a
            cloud-computing storage provider that will help it compete with
            Amazon.com Inc. Many of IBM's customers are just starting to
            become interested in software delivered via the Internet, known
            as software-as-a-service or SaaS, said Marc Dietz, the director
            of SmartCloud solutions for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're serving a growing demand with a new way that we're
            going to market,' Dietz said. 'It's really an expansion and a
            comprehensive cloud strategy for our clients.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With SaaS, customers buy software as they use it and can
            access it through the Internet, as opposed to signing multiyear
            contracts for installation and support. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is also adding new software
            to the portfolio, including a social-media analytics product
            that will allow businesses to monitor customer sentiment on
            Facebook and Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Atom Boy Joins Police Sketch Artist to Give Ads Novel Twist</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A police sketch artist and 'the
            world's smallest film' are helping to sell soap and technology
            for Dove and IBM as advertisers unleash a wave of more subtle,
            intelligent and entertaining campaigns to lure a jaded public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unilever NV (UNA)'s six-minute 'Dove Sketches' film, in which a
            former San Jose Police Department sketch artist helps women
            realize 'You are more beautiful than you think,' became the
            most viewed online ad of all time in May with more than 114
            million views. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)'s
            researchers manipulated individual atoms to depict a youngster
            playing with a ball. The result is 'A Boy and His Atom,' which
            holds the record as the world's smallest stop-motion movie. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These spots from WPP Plc (WPP)'s Ogilvy Mather agency weren't
            part of a traditional TV and newspaper campaign, yet racked up
            millions of views online at YouTube. As the divide between
            content and marketing narrows, a new category called native
            advertising is advancing. In addition to expensive films and
            mini-documentaries, it includes sponsored newsfeeds on Facebook
            and LinkedIn (LNKD), and branded content for magazines and newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The ad industry is getting smarter about putting the
            right ads in front of the right people,' said Jonathan Nelson,
            chief executive officer for digital at Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC), the
            second-largest advertising company. 'We're not trying to dupe
            the customer into not knowing it's an ad, but in a world with so
            much fragmentation it's hard to get attention.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell said in an interview, 'I've always been of the view that the
            dividing line between editorial and advertising would blur, and that was fine as long as you made it quite
            clear to the consumer.' Close

        <headline>IBM, Dutch Team Up on Water Data, Real-Time Intelligence</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) started a program with Dutch authorities to investigate
            how to analyze water and flood data in the Netherlands, almost a
            fifth of which is covered by lakes, rivers and dikes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The initiative will provide water experts with a real-time intelligent dashboard to harness
            information so it can be
            shared immediately across organizations and agencies,' IBM said
            today in a statement. Collaboration partners include an
            Environment Ministry office and the University of Delft, said
            IBM, based in Armonk, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new management system in the Netherlands, where a
            quarter of the land is below sea level, will address concerns
            ranging from drinking water quality to the increasing frequency
            and impact of extreme weather, IBM said. The data sources
            include water level monitors, levee sensors and current and
            historic maintenance information from sluices, pumping stations
            and dams. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By modeling weather events, the Netherlands will be able
            to determine the best course of action including storing water,
            diverting it from low-lying areas, avoiding saltwater intrusion
            into drinking water, sewage overflows and water contamination,'
            the largest computer-services provider said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Two More Charged With Insider Trading Over IBM-SPSS Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Two stockbrokers were charged with
            insider trading tied to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)'s
            $1.2 billion acquisition of software company SPSS Inc., in a
            probe that has already yielded three guilty pleas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daryl Payton, 38, and Benjamin Durant III, 37, pleaded not
            guilty to one count of conspiracy and five counts of securities
            fraud in an indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court. The
            two men, arrested this morning in New York by the Federal Bureau
            of Investigation, were each released on $250,000 bond set by
            U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Payton and Durant were part of a group of friends who
            traded on the IBM tip, the U.S. said. When the SPSS deal was
            announced on July 28, 2009, the pair met with three other co-conspirators at a New York hotel to discuss a
            cover story,
            according to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Benjamin Durant and Daryl Payton not only acquired inside
            information about a corporate acquisition and made illegal
            profits from it, but they colluded with others to conceal their
            crime,' Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peggy Cross-Goldenberg, a lawyer for Durant, and Jim Roth,
            an attorney for Payton, declined to comment about their clients
            after court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The arrests are the latest in a federal crackdown by
            Bharara's office and the FBI on insider trading at hedge funds,
            technology companies and so-called expert networking firms.
            Payton and Durant are among at least 88 people who have been
            charged since 2009, with 81 having been convicted, most after
            guilty pleas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Payton, Durant, David Weishaus and Thomas Conradt were
            employed as brokers at Euro Pacific Capital Inc., according to
            the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Same Brokerage' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They all worked together at the same brokerage firm here
            in New York City and they all made a substantial amount of money
            on inside information, hundreds of thousands of dollars,'
            Assistant U.S. Attorney John Zach said today at the arraignment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Payton and Durant were also sued by the U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission, which alleged the two made more than
            $290,000 in illegal profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After getting the tip from an associate at the New York law
            firm representing IBM, Trent Martin passed the information to
            his roommate, Conradt, the SEC said. Conradt immediately shared
            the information with Weishaus, a friend, who tipped off his co-workers Payton and Durant, according to the
            U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin, Conradt and Weishaus all pleaded guilty last year
            and await sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;41% Jump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Payton and Durant bought securities in SPSS in the days
            leading up to the announcement of the acquisition. When the deal
            was made public, the software company's stock rose by 41 percent
            in a day, earning Durant $53,000 in illegal profit and Payton
            $243,000, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Euro Pacific was subpoenaed in November 2009 by the
            SEC as part of its investigation, Payton, Durant, Conradt and
            Weishaus were questioned by the broker and later fired, said
            Andrew Schiff, director of marketing for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The firm has been cleared by the SEC and Finra and had
            control systems in place to detect this kind of conduct,'
            Schiff said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Martin, 12-cr-00887, the civil
            case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v. Payton, 14-cv-04644, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Accenture Falls as Forecast Trails, Dragging Down IBM</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Accenture Plc (ACN), the world's second-largest technology-consulting company, tumbled the most in
            almost two years after its sales forecast trailed analysts'
            estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock fell 10 percent to $71.96 at 4 p.m. in New York
            trading, the biggest decline since August 2011. The plunge
            dragged down stocks of rivals, including International Business
            Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Accenture is grappling with a change in the behavior of its
            clients, who in recent quarters have been deferring decisions on
            short-term contracts and favoring longer-range information-technology projects. That means investors have to
            get used to
            waiting for the revenue to show up. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've got this continuous strength in bookings but this
            inability to gain traction on revenue, and it's becoming a
            growing concern,' said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones
            Co. in Des Peres, Missouri. ''The fourth quarter is going to be
            a challenge, and the trend could play out into their next fiscal
            year.' Olson has a hold rating on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM slipped 2.3 percent to $191.11. Before today,
            Accenture, which ranks second to IBM in consulting revenue, had
            jumped 21 percent this year through yesterday, outperforming
            IBM's gain of 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fiscal fourth-quarter revenue will be $6.7 billion to $7
            billion, Dublin-based Accenture yesterday in a statement. That
            fell short of the $7.36 billion average estimate of analysts,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Missing Guidance' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income attributable to Accenture rose 18
            percent to $810.3 million, or $1.21 a share, from $689.2
            million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. Excluding a reduction
            in reorganization liabilities, earnings were $1.14 a share in
            the period, which ended in May. Analysts had predicted $1.13 on
            average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've had some areas of our business where the activity
            is much different than we would have expected, some of which
            would have been tough to predict,' David Rowland, Accenture's
            new chief financial officer, said on a conference call. 'We are
            not in the business of missing guidance and we don't find that
            to be acceptable, so that would not be our expectation going
            forward.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Accenture is considered a bellwether for the information-technology market because its earnings
            cycle ends one month
            sooner than competitors. Revenue for the quarter was $7.2
            billion, missing the $7.43 billion analysts had predicted on
            average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Early Look &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We always want to get an update from them on the overall
            IT services spending environment,' said Jason Kupferberg, an
            analyst at Jefferies LLC in New York. 'The numbers have not
            looked great.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is seeking to boost growth by expanding its
            Accenture Interactive division, which caters to chief marketing
            officers who want to improve their investments in Internet
            outreach. Accenture announced plans in May to spend $316 million
            to buy Hong Kong-based marketing company Acquity Group Ltd. (AQ) to
            bolster the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, is scheduled to report its
            earnings in three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google, IBM, Nasdaq, Finra Plan Bids to Build SEC Audit T</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), Infosys Ltd. (INFO),
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and the Financial Industry
            Regulatory Authority plan to bid on a project to build a
            comprehensive market oversight system for U.S. securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exchange operators NYSE Euronext (NYX), Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and
            Bats Global Markets Inc. also said they would submit bids, as
            did high-frequency trading technology provider Tradeworx Inc.,
            which supplies a system to the Securities and Exchange
            Commission that compiles information from private data streams
            about quotations and trades. The list of 31 candidates was
            published on the website for the so-called consolidated audit
            trail that the exchanges and Finra are developing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The audit trail, one of former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro's
            main projects, will track all securities orders and trades in
            the U.S. from start to completion and give the agency and other
            regulators a powerful system to monitor markets and reconstruct
            crashes. The exchanges and Finra said in November they would
            submit the plan in December 2013, eight months later than
            initially expected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a milestone since the key inputs of the
            consolidated audit-trail plan will result from this request-for-
            proposal process,' Manisha Kimmel, executive director of the
            New York-based Financial Information Forum, a group of brokers,
            exchanges and vendors in the securities industry that focuses on
            operational and technology issues, said by phone. The firm that
            wins the bid will have a 'definite impact on the CAT process
            from an operational angle and the fact we're now going to get
            multiple perspectives on this is very positive,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stockholm, London &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cinnober Financial Technology AB, a Stockholm-based company
            that offers trading and clearing platforms, will bid for the
            project, according to the list. MillenniumIT, owned by the
            London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE), will also bid. The Colombo, Sri
            Lanka-based unit provides systems to the LSE, London Metal
            Exchange, Icap Plc and Turquoise, an alternative venue owned by
            the London market operator, the company's website said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's good to have competition,' James Angel, a finance
            professor at Georgetown University in Washington, said in a
            phone interview. 'A lot of the names are the usual suspects
            such as Finra and Nasdaq and other financial players, but some
            aren't. It's an interesting mix of financial-data companies,
            exchanges and big IT companies.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Computerized Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC, hurt by criticism that it doesn't have the data to
            analyze high-speed computerized trading, approved a rule in July
            requiring the exchanges and Finra, known as self-regulatory
            organizations, to produce a plan to establish the audit trail.
            The SEC must approve the submission by the 17 exchanges and the
            private-sector regulator, which oversees almost 4,300 brokerage
            firms, before it can be built. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Elisse Walter said she hopes the audit-trail
            initiative can be expanded beyond stocks and options to include
            equities traded in the U.S. without being listed on American
            exchanges, bonds and futures. In addition to monitoring markets
            and analyzing market crashes, a well-constructed data initiative
            could be used to inform how new regulations are written, she
            said in a speech on Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I can't overestimate the importance of CAT,' Walter
            said. 'Comprehensive public and non-public data about the
            market, coming from a single system, could be the most important
            regulatory development in my lifetime.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Consolidated Trail &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The self-regulatory organizations tasked with proposing the
            plan for the consolidated audit trail can bid for the job of
            constructing and managing it. Finra said last year it wanted to
            build and administer the data system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A document prepared for a conference for potential bidders
            on Jan. 29, before the publication of the official request-for-
            proposal, or RFP, included a disclosure that said exchange or
            Finra officials attending the meeting would represent the views
            of the group instead of their organization. Some personnel may
            assist with the group's efforts and an SRO's RFP response, the
            document said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The exchanges and Finra said last month they would
            establish an advisory group to offer input on the audit-trail
            development process and consider how the plan may affect brokers
            and the broader industry. Participants will include individuals
            from the Financial Information Forum, Securities Industry and
            Financial Markets Association, and Security Traders Association,
            according to the notice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Identification Codes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That group may discuss issues such as customer
            identification codes, different scenarios for how orders are
            handled within the data system, conflicts of interest and
            funding alternatives for the audit trail, the notice said. It's
            different from the SEC-mandated advisory committee that will be
            formed once the regulation governing the audit trail goes into
            effect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group responsible for the audit-trail plan will hold a
            conference for organizations submitting bids on Friday. Bids are
            due on April 25, according to the group's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuters Corp. and SunGard Data Systems Inc. will
            also seek to win the contract to build and manage the audit
            trail. The former is a data and news provider while the latter
            offers trading and risk management systems. Bloomberg LP, the
            parent company of Bloomberg News, competes with Thomson Reuters
            in supplying financial news and information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other firms offering consulting, telecommunications, data
            and technology systems that intend to submit offers for the
            audit-trail initiative include Sapient Corp. (SAPE), Wipro Ltd., Grant
            Thornton LLP, Capgemini Financial Services USA Inc., BT Group
            Plc (BT) and GXS Inc. GXS, a spinoff of General Electric Co., helped
            develop the Basic computer language, according to a company
            history on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Broad interest in the audit-trail project isn't surprising,
            Sang Lee, managing partner at Boston-based research firm Aite
            Group LLC, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For those technology vendors and exchanges with
            substantial technology business, it gives them the opportunity
            for revenue generation as well as becoming the central hub for
            data collection and dissemination,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM's Rometty Says Company Didn't Meet Expectations in 2013</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ginni Rometty, chief executive
            officer of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), said the
            company fell short of expectations last year and must address
            its struggling hardware businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We must acknowledge that while 2013 was an important year
            of transformation, our performance did not meet our
            expectations,' Rometty, who is also chairman, said over the
            weekend in a letter to investors in the company's annual report.
            'While we continue to remix to higher value, we must also
            address those parts of the business that are holding us back.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has struggled in a shift to the cloud era, where data
            and information are delivered online instead of being stored
            onsite. Falling demand for hardware and weak sales in growth
            markets have dragged down revenue for the last seven quarters,
            prompting Rometty to sell assets, fire and furlough workers, buy
            back shares and cut taxes to help meet profit goals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company announced today that Michael Eskew, the former
            chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service Inc. who has been on
            the IBM board since 2005, will become IBM's first presiding
            director on May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the newly created position, Eskew will serve as a
            liaison between the chairman and independent directors and be
            able to call meetings of independent directors, according to a
            regulatory filing. The presiding director also will be available
            to speak with major shareholders, if requested, after
            discussions with Rometty. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
            Inc. is IBM's largest shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Leadership Structure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Board members 'as a whole accepted the recommendation of
            Mrs. Rometty and believe that this leadership structure will
            provide the company with the continued benefits of combining the
            leadership role of chairman and CEO, while also recognizing the
            unique strengths and capabilities of IBM's board members,' the
            company said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's sales fell 5 percent last year, and the stock was the
            only decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That led top
            executives to forgo annual bonuses and shrink the company's
            headcount for the first time in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With no bonus, Rometty's 2013 pay, calculated using U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission rules, fell 14 percent from a
            year earlier to $14 million. On the recommendation of the
            board's compensation committee, IBM's independent directors
            approved a long-term incentive plan for Rometty of $12.75
            million in performance-based stock awards for the period ending
            in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The committee believes Mrs. Rometty performed well in
            shifting investments into key segments of the portfolio and
            advancing innovative solutions, creating a strong foundation for
            transformation in 2014,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Maintaining Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even as revenue has tumbled, Rometty reaffirmed IBM's goal
            of $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015 -- up from $11.67 in
            2010, the letter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $186.39 at the close
            in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CEO said the company will continue shifting its focus
            to cloud services and data analytics while making changes to its
            hardware products. The company agreed in January to sell most of
            its low-end server business for $2.3 billion to Lenovo Group
            Ltd. (992) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After buying cloud provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc.
            last year for $2 billion, IBM is integrating existing hardware
            and data analytics with its services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM will use its Power Systems servers to help deliver its
            Watson tool through the cloud, the company said last month. The
            company is spending $1 billion on building a new business group
            around the technology, which analyzes troves of information and
            answers questions in plain English. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This follows a $1.2 billion commitment to bolster
            SoftLayer's cloud offerings by adding new data centers and an
            expansion of the services to lure new customers as it faces off
            with competitors like Amazon.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dow Jones Index Reaches Record as Caterpillar, IBM Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) crawled back to a record, helped along by last year's
            worst-performing stocks: International Business Machines Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four
            months after reaching its previous closing high of 16,576.66, the 30-stock gauge eclipsed the level
            yesterday, rising 0.3 percent to 16,580.84. It was the index's third straight increase, coming after the
            Federal Reserve said it would continue to trim the pace of bond purchases as the economy gains momentum.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caterpillar, which boosted its full-year profit outlook last week on improved
            expectations for construction, and IBM, the computer services provider that raised its dividend this month,
            are both up 14 percent since the Dow bottomed on Feb. 3. Armonk, New York-based IBM fell 2.1 percent and
            Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar added 1.3 percent in 2013, when the Dow had its best rally in 18 years.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Investors are getting into the more blue-chip, unloved and overlooked areas of the
            market that have more value in an environment where growth is lacking,' Todd Lowenstein, a fund manager who
            helps manage $16 billion at Highmark Capital Management Inc. in Los Angeles, said in a phone interview.
            'You're seeing a massive rotation from the frothy, speculative glamor areas.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equity
            Valuations &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dow's gain of 45.47 points yesterday bought its April advance to 0.8
            percent, a third straight monthly gain that capped a 7.9 percent rally from its Feb. 3 low. The index sank
            7.3 percent in the first five weeks of this year after surging 27 percent to close 2013 at the record. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dow futures gained 14 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 16,525 at 9:44 a.m. in London today.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) of technology stocks sank 2 percent last month, adding
            to a 2.5 percent slide in March that was its steepest since 2012, as investors sold the biggest winners from
            the five-year bull market on concern that valuations have outpaced earnings growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stocks
            in the Dow index trade for an average of 15 times reported earnings, while the higher-growth members of the
            Nasdaq index are valued at 35 times profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Caterpillar climbed 0.1 percent yesterday to
            $105.40, up from a 2014 low of $86.17 on Jan. 24. The world's largest maker of construction machinery said
            sales in that segment rose 20 percent in the first quarter while earnings tripled. IBM increased 0.7 percent
            to $196.47, compared with a low of $172.84 on Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blue-chip record came amid
            broader equity gains today after the Fed concluded its two-day policy meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growth
            Pickup &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed
            sharply,' the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement following a meeting in Washington.
            'Household spending appears to be rising more quickly.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Policy makers committee pared
            monthly asset buying to $45 billion, its fourth straight $10 billion cut, and said further reductions in
            'measured steps' are likely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The Fed seems to be putting aside the weakness in the
            first quarter that the market reacted to this morning,' Walter Todd, who oversees about $975 million as
            chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC, said in a phone interview. 'The statement
            seems business as usual, and perhaps if you'd seen the Fed react more dovish to a weaker first quarter, that
            would've been more negative.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;SP Recovery &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed decision pushed
            the Standard Poor's 500 Index to within seven points of its all-time high reached on April 2. The gauge rose
            0.3 percent to cap a 0.6 percent gain in April, its third straight monthly advance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            SP 500's 8.2 percent recovery from a low of 1,741.89 on Feb. 3 has been led by a 14 percent rally energy
            stocks and increases of 11 percent each in industries least tied to economic growth: utilities and
            home-product makers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fed Chair Janet Yellen is winding down record stimulus as the
            economy shows signs of rebounding from a first-quarter standstill. At the same time, the Fed repeated that
            it's likely to keep the benchmark interest rate near zero for a 'considerable time' after bond purchases
            end. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This announcement is really no news is good news. No surprises here,' Kristina
            Hooper, a U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York, said in a phone interview. The
            firm oversees $475 billion. 'The market will have a positive reaction, might be muted, but it's positive
            because this announcement is more of the same in terms of underscoring that Fed is going to remain very
            accommodative.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Barely Grew &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data today showed the U.S. economy
            barely grew in the first quarter as harsh winter weather chilled investment and exports dropped. The
            expansion stalled even as consumer spending on services rose by the most in 14 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gross
            domestic product grew at a 0.1 percent annualized rate from January through March, compared with a 2.6
            percent gain in the prior quarter, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington. The
            median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.2 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            pullback in growth came as snow blanketed much of the eastern half of the country, keeping shoppers from
            stores, preventing builders from breaking ground and raising costs for companies including United Parcel
            Service Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies in the U.S. boosted payrolls by 220,000 in April, figures from
            the ADP Research Institute in Roseland, New Jersey, showed today. The median forecast of 45 economists
            surveyed by Bloomberg called for an advance of 210,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jobs Reports &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            ADP numbers come before data from the Labor Department on May 2. The government's report may show employers
            added 215,000 workers in April, the most since November, according to economists' projections. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some 75 percent of the 310 SP 500 (SPX) members that have reported earnings this season have posted
            profit that exceeded analysts' estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About 52 percent beat sales
            projections, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Profits for members of the index climbed 3.4 percent
            in the first quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. They had predicted an increase
            of 0.7 percent as recently as April 17. Revenue probably rose 2.8 percent in the quarter, the projections
            show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest computer-services provider also sold $1 billion

        <headline>IBM Cuts Hours of Contract Employees as Company Retrenches</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM),
            cutting costs in the wake of its first quarterly earnings
            shortfall in eight years, ordered some U.S. contract workers to
            reduce their hours, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CDI Corp. (CDI), a provider of staffing and outsourcing services,
            told employees working on IBM jobs that they should bill for no
            more than 36 hours a week in the second quarter, according to
            the memo. CDI, based in Philadelphia, cited 'challenging
            economic conditions' in explaining the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You should understand that this action is being taken by
            IBM to retain as many CDI resources as possible for future
            work,' Eric Gonzalez, a delivery executive, said in the memo.
            'This action is not a reflection of any dissatisfaction over
            the services provided by you or CDI but rather an IBM business
            decision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When it reported earnings on April 18, IBM said it would
            spend $1 billion cutting jobs in its own workforce to reduce
            expenses. The company, famous for methodically setting and
            meeting its goals, jolted shareholders by posting first-quarter
            profit of $3 a share, missing the $3.05 predicted by analysts.
            The shares tumbled almost 10 percent to $187.83 over the
            following two trading days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has regained some of that ground over the past 10 days.
            The stock climbed 1.4 percent to $202.39 at the close today in
            New York, bringing it within $5 of its pre-earnings value. CDI
            shares, meanwhile, fell 4.9 percent to $14.04. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vince Webb, a CDI spokesman, declined to comment on the
            memo. IBM, the world's biggest computer-services provider,
            accounts for 20 percent of CDI's revenue, according to the
            contractor's annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
            also declined to comment on the memo. The company relies on
            contractors to manage labor costs on information-technology
            projects for clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM told CDI that the change in hours would only be in
            effect during the second quarter, according to the memo. The
            employees aren't allowed to work beyond 36 hours unless approved
            in writing by IBM management. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Lenovo, IBM Talks on Server Deal Said to Break Down</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM)'s negotiations to sell parts of its server division to
            Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) broke down after the two sides couldn't agree
            on a price, said a person familiar with the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo Chief Financial Officer Wong Wai Ming, who was in
            the U.S. this past week for the talks, left for Hong Kong
            without an agreement, said the person, who declined to be
            identified because negotiations are private. The talks could
            resume later, the person said. James Sciales, a spokesman for
            IBM, and Jeffrey Shafer, a spokesman for Lenovo, both declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo wanted to pay toward the low end of the $2.5
            billion-to-$4.5 billion range that Bloomberg News reported on
            April 19, while Armonk, New York-based IBM sought a
            substantially higher valuation, the person said, without
            providing details. In 2005, Lenovo purchased IBM's personal-
            computer unit, which helped make the Beijing-based company the
            world's second-largest PC manufacturer. The servers rely on
            similar x86 processors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The breakdown of talks was reported by Fortune on May 1.
            Lenovo shares fell 2.7 percent to HK$6.90 yesterday in Hong
            Kong. IBM rose 1.4 percent to $202.39 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Trouble &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM was looking to divest a portion of its business with
            lower profit as it seeks earnings per share of $20 by 2015,
            compared with $15.25 last year. The company has had trouble
            selling its hardware products, with a 17 percent drop in the
            unit's revenue last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Apple to IBM Lead U.S. Bond Sales in High-Grade Technology Boom</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., International Business
            Machines Corp. (IBM) and Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) led dollar-denominated
            bond sales of $43 billion in the busiest week this year for
            high-grade technology companies as relative yields narrowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple, the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, set a record
            for the biggest corporate bond sale ever with its $17 billion
            six-part offering on April 30, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. IBM raised $2.25 billion and Texas Instruments sold
            $1 billion, bringing the number of investment-grade technology
            issuers in the market to three, the highest this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple kicked off the rush of issuance when it announced on
            April 23 that it was planning to raise debt for the first time
            in almost two decades to help fund a $100 billion capital reward
            for shareholders. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest software
            maker, came to market later that week with a $2.67 billion
            offering in euros and dollars followed by Texas Instruments, in
            their first sales this year, and IBM, which obtained record-low
            coupons on its first sale in three months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It definitely wakes you up, because if a competitor of
            yours is starting to do or change strategies, you're going to
            take note,' William Larkin, a fixed-income portfolio manager
            who helps oversee $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc.,
            said in a telephone interview from Salem, Massachusetts. 'There
            is always a herd mentality, because it's how you survive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Herd Mentality' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
            rather than government debentures narrowed to 208 basis points
            as of yesterday from 212 basis points on April 26, according to
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields decreased to a
            record-low 3.35 percent from 3.38 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Offerings increased from $39.4 billion last week and were
            the most since $47.3 billion in the five days ended March 22,
            Bloomberg data show. Apple's offering helped push sales in April
            to $148.6 billion, the most ever for the month in data going
            back to 1999, and the busiest period since January's $171
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fall in Treasury yields 'has encouraged issuers to
            maybe think, 'Is this the last opportunity we've got to take
            advantage of the low-rate environment?'' Jonathan Fine, head of
            investment-grade syndicate for the Americas at Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. in New York, which helped manage the Apple sale, said
            in a telephone interview. 'Demand for well-rated, large-cap
            companies is extraordinary right now.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 10-year Treasury note's yield has dropped to 1.7
            percent from 2.06 percent on a closing basis on March 11, the
            highest in about a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Apple Participation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orders for the Apple sale totaled $52 billion, according to
            a person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
            identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. The
            Cupertino, California-based company sold its first bonds since
            1996, issuing $3 billion of floating-rate notes and $14 billion
            of fixed-rate securities, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The strength of the Apple credit drove participation
            globally,' Matthew Siracuse, a managing director in global risk
            syndicate at Deutsche Bank AG, which also helped run the Apple
            deal, said in a telephone interview. 'We saw good participation
            from both European as well as Asian accounts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offering's largest portion, $5.5 billion of 2.4
            percent, 10-year securities paying a 75 basis-point spread,
            traded at 100.247 cents on the dollar to yield 2.37 percent, a
            spread of 74.2 basis points, at 8:24 a.m. in New York, according
            to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
            Industry Regulatory Authority. The floating-rate portion
            included bonds due in 2016 and 2018, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'More Defensive' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're seeing a deeper bid for floating-rate notes,'
            Siracuse said. 'There is a subset of the overall market that
            believes rates are going to go higher and is being more
            defensive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $37.6
            billion, compared with $31.2 billion last week and a 2013 weekly
            average of $23.4 billion, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on investment-grade debt fell to a record-low 2.647
            percent yesterday from 2.66 percent on April 26, according to
            the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate index. Spreads
            were unchanged at 147 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments, the largest maker of analog
            semiconductors, issued equal $500 million portions of 1 percent,
            five-year notes that pay a relative yield of 55 basis points and
            2.25 percent, 10-year bonds with a spread of 85, Bloomberg data
            show. Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay debt
            including its $500 million of 0.875 percent notes maturing May
            15, the Dallas-based company said May 1 in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Coupon &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When treasurers get a chance to look back at what we're
            experiencing today, and the coupons they're achieving, they'll
            say, 'Those were the good old days.'' Timothy Cox, executive
            director of debt capital markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.
            in New York, which helped sell the Texas Instruments bonds, said
            in a telephone interview. 'We're in the middle of it right
            now.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM obtained a record-low 1.625 percent coupon on $1.25
            billion of notes due May 2020, beating a 1.65 percent rate on
            $750 million of debt sold last July by Texas Instruments,
            Bloomberg data show. The largest computer-services provider also
            sold $1 billion of three-year debt at a 0.45 percent coupon,
            matching a record-low for that maturity obtained by Apple Inc. (AAPL),
            Texas Instruments, Unilever Plc and Walt Disney Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Speculative Grade &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6
            billion, compared with $7.8 billion last week and a 2013 weekly
            average of $8.2 billion, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on junk debt fell to a record-low 6.085 percent
            yesterday from 6.16 percent on April 26, according to the Bank
            of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index. Spreads narrowed
            15 basis points to 445 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody's
            Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuers planning sales include Seven Generations Energy
            Ltd. with a $250 million offering of seven-year notes and ION
            Geophysical Corp. with a $175 million deal, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Shareholder Drops Suit Over Cooperation With NSA</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;An International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) shareholder withdrew a lawsuit claiming the company's
            cooperation with a National Security Agency eavesdropping
            program caused a drop in its China sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension and Relief Fund dropped the
            securities fraud suit after investigating its claims against
            IBM, lawyers for the fund said in a letter to U.S. District
            Judge Denise Cote made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision was 'based on new information that wasn't
            available' earlier, John C. Browne, a lawyer for the fund, said
            in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, which had criticized the suit as 'pushing a wild
            conspiracy theory,' said the fund did the right thing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At the time this suit was filed, we said the complaint
            proceeded to make numerous specious and false accusations, and
            IBM called upon the law firm that filed this action to do the
            right thing and dismiss it,' Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman,
            said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM, the largest computer-services provider, reported a 22
            percent drop in sales in China on Oct. 16 compared with the
            previous quarter as a result of disclosures by Edward Snowden
            that the company was cooperating with the NSA, the Louisiana
            fund said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Snowden, now living in Russia, had revealed details of an
            NSA surveillance program showing that technology companies were
            providing data at the request of government agencies. IBM in
            March said it hadn't disclosed client data to the U.S.
            government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Louisiana fund said it pays retirement, death and
            disability benefits to more than 20,000 active and retired
            employees of sheriffs' offices across the state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension Relief Fund v.
            International Business Machines Corp., 13-cv-08818, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Old and Fired at IBM: Tech Trendsetter Changes the Game, Guards Age Data</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;For at least a decade, International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) gave fired employees information
            detailing a severance package that asked them to waive age-discrimination claims and also included a page
            listing the job titles and ages of workers being let go. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This disclosure helps fired
            employees determine if they have an age-discrimination case, and it's required by U.S. federal law for
            workers over 40 if a company wants the person to agree not to file such a lawsuit. Now IBM is withholding
            the information, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg. It's avoiding the disclosure requirement by
            offering workers the option of bringing claims in arbitration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although employees are
            now able to accept a severance agreement and maintain their ability to bring an age-discrimination claim in
            arbitration, the strategy could make it harder and riskier for dismissed older employees to decide whether
            it's worth taking on the cost of a legal battle, lawyers and labor law experts say. And many older workers
            are already feeling vulnerable in a still anemic economic recovery, said Ross Eisenbrey, vice president of
            the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank affiliated with labor. IBM, considered a pioneer in
            employee benefits, may be one of the first major companies to make these changes in severance agreements.

        <headline>IBM CEO Faces Wall Street Skeptics as Growth Proves Elusive</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines (IBM) Corp.
            Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty will face a skeptical
            audience when she speaks to Wall Street analysts tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As she's worked to revamp the company in a shifting
            technology industry, Rometty has kept herself bound to IBM's
            target of at least $18 a share in adjusted earnings this year --
            a number that 60 percent of analysts anticipate the company will
            miss. After eight consecutive quarters of revenue declines, she
            must start increasing sales or reduce expenses further to avoid
            missing the profit goals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At a daylong conference in New York, Rometty, 56, will
            probably lay out her plan to use newer technology, such as data
            analytics and cloud computing, to mount a strong comeback in the
            coming quarters. The question is whether those lines of business
            can expand quickly enough to make up for falling sales in IBM's
            hardware unit and in emerging markets like China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has to be intense pressure on her to carry out the
            execution of the plan,' Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones
            Co., said in an interview from St. Louis. 'The concern is
            largely about the way to get there.' He advises buying the
            shares and estimates IBM will hit the $18 target. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're transitioning to key growth areas and transforming
            parts of the business,' Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call last month.
            'We're
            continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as
            mobility, security and cloud, and these initiatives are gaining
            traction but are not yet at scale.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abandon Roadmap? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those changes need to happen more quickly, and Rometty
            should consider dropping her earnings targets so she can focus
            on the transition, said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the deterioration in earnings quality and revenue
            challenges, we believe it makes sense for IBM to abandon its
            roadmap and change its business model,' he said in a research
            note. The company needs to more aggressively shift to providing
            technology as a service rather than a product, he said. He has
            the equivalent of a neutral rating and estimates IBM will report
            adjusted earnings of $17.80 this year, short of its target. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM shares are up 2.5 percent this year, in line with the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index. They fell less than 1 percent to
            $192.19 at the close today in New York. Eight analysts advise
            buying the stock, while 24 say to hold and three recommend
            selling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After a 30-year career at IBM, Rometty stepped into the
            role of CEO in 2012 amid sweeping changes in the industry. Her
            company is still adjusting to the upheaval in the technology
            world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology customers are increasingly storing data and
            software on cloud-computing networks, rather than on site,
            limiting their need for servers and mainframes and the IBM
            consultants needed to install and maintain them. While the
            company has shifted its focus to cloud services and data
            analytics to keep up, the effort has not been enough to
            reinvigorate sales growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lagging demand for IBM's hardware division continues to
            drag down revenue, with the unit's sales falling 23 percent to
            $2.4 billion in the first quarter. Revenue in developing
            countries slid 11 percent, or 5 percent when adjusting for
            currency fluctuations. Revenue from China fell 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's meeting with analysts gives Rometty and her
            executive team a chance to show how their more recent
            investments will produce more revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'IBM has implemented significant actions as it shifts
            toward a higher valued-added mix; by no means is the company
            standing still,' Jim Kelleher, an analyst at Argus Research in
            New York, said in a note. 'IBM has also shown an ability to
            align costs in periods of challenging revenue growth.' He has a
            hold rating on the shares and estimates IBM will fall short of
            its target with earnings of $17.96 a share this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Products &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company will probably highlight newer products tomorrow
            like the cloud offerings from SoftLayer Technologies Inc., which
            it acquired last year, or the Watson cognitive-computing tool,
            said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co.
            In a note to investors, he questioned whether those initiatives
            are incremental for the company or can actually help boost sales
            growth. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the shares and
            estimates IBM will hit its $18 target. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cloud Promise &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has held up cloud computing as one of its biggest
            opportunities for growth. Cloud revenue grew more than 50
            percent last quarter, and cloud offerings delivered as a service
            are now on pace to generate about $2.3 billion a year. That's
            still a fraction of IBM's total $100 billion in annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While it searches for growth, IBM is also cutting expenses
            and shedding less profitable businesses. Earlier this year,
            China's Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) agreed to buy IBM's low-end server
            business for $2.3 billion. The deal is awaiting government
            review before closing, and the companies must convince U.S.
            officials that the transaction won't give China back-door access
            to secrets and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower tax rates have also helped profits continue to grow,
            and a surge in buybacks has helped IBM hit its targets for
            earnings per share. It also took an $870 million charge last
            quarter to cut jobs, and has changed the information it provides
            in U.S. severance packages in a way that may help reduce age-discrimination lawsuits, according to lawyers
            and labor law
            experts. IBM said the changes were made to protect worker
            privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's cost-cutting moves helped lift adjusted
            profit to $16.28 a share last year, up 40 percent from 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For this year, the average estimate of 25 analysts is for
            $17.88 a share in adjusted earnings, less than the company's $18
            target. Next year's average analyst estimate of $19.79 a share
            also falls short of a $20 goal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has said it can meet its forecasts, even as costs mount
            in its pursuit of the goals. IBM's debt has climbed, and its
            cash balance has dropped, partly because of spending on stock
            repurchases -- spending that could have gone to acquisitions or
            other investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some Wall Street analysts, such as Morningstar Inc.'s Peter Wahlstrom, argue that Rometty shouldn't
            be trying to hit the
            targets. Yardsticks like revenue and free cash flow are more
            important than earnings per share anyway, Wahlstrom said. He has
            a hold rating and estimates IBM's adjusted earnings will fall
            short of the target at $17.47 a share this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Those are things that can be kind of managed,' he said
            of earnings per share. 'You don't really give a company credit
            for that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Numbers to watch include: &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;*Free cash flow: CFO Schroeter said last month that the company
            expects at least $16 billion for the year, up from $15 billion
            in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given that non-operating forces have a limited impact on
            FCF vs. EPS (buybacks, tax rate, one-time gains, etc), we expect
            investors to remain focused on this metric and to look for both
            upside and downside risk at the analyst day,' Bernstein's
            Sacconaghi said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;*Acquisitions: IBM said in 2010 it planned to spend $20 billion
            on acquisitions through 2015. With revenue declining, some
            analysts say a large acquisition could be warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the ongoing challenges with weak organic revenue
            (especially in hardware), IBM may need to do a large deal to
            help stabilize the revenue,' Reitzes of Barclays said in a
            note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;*Growth markets: IBM has said it expects emerging markets to
            approach 30 percent of revenue in 2015. Last year, the markets
            made up 23 percent of total sales after falling 4.9 percent
            year-over-year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We also expect to hear about IBM's growth markets and
            what changes have been put in place to stimulate revenue
            growth,' Reitzes said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) opened a center today for computing systems in Beijing
            to help customers and outside software engineers develop business applications for the open-source Linux
            operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The facility will aid creation of programs for big data, cloud, mobile
            and social-business computing and represents 'a sizable investment,' Colin Parris, general manager of IBM
            Power Systems, said in an interview. He declined to say how much the company spent or how many workers were
            employed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is focusing on profitable businesses
            including data analysis and cloud computing to maintain growth. She has said services that help customers
            mine troves of information to make better decisions are the company's biggest priority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'China
            is an environment in which you have some of the largest challenges,' Parris said by phone from Beijing. 'If
            you solve those adequately in China, what you have is a capability to deliver that solution around the
            world.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Beijing center is the company's first to focus on Linux applications for
            IBM's Power Systems-brand servers, Parris said. The center will collaborate with Linux distributors Red Hat
            Inc. (RHT) and Attachmate Group's SUSE, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Says Tech-Shift Impact Similar to Financial Crisis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty said she remains
            confident in the company's 2015 profit forecast despite tumbling sales in hardware and in emerging markets
            like China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a meeting with analysts and investors in New York today, Rometty compared
            the company's current five-year financial goal to the prior four-year projection, when IBM still reached its
            earnings forecasts amid a global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I view both periods somewhat similar
            with unforecasted things that have happened,' Rometty said. 'This time, we didn't expect, and obviously
            didn't plan for, some of the variability in the growth markets as well as our hardware business. You always
            have things you didn't plan for.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM is coping with an industrywide shift of technology
            customers increasingly storing data and software on cloud-computing networks, rather than on site. That's
            limited customers' need for servers and mainframes. While IBM (IBM) has shifted its focus to cloud services
            and data analytics to keep up, the effort hasn't been enough to reinvigorate sales growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            falling 23 percent to $2.4 billion in the first quarter. The division recorded a wider pretax loss of $660
            million in the period. The company said today that it expects the hardware unit to be profitable again in
            2015. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
            Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge predicted earnings this

            estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forecast suggests that profit will rise to about $3.79
            a share in the period, excluding some items, up from $3.51 a

            &lt;p&gt;Loughridge repeated his view that the Armonk, New York-based company's growth in the second half of

        <headline>IBM-Waterfund Index Expands With Uganda as First African Nation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
            and Waterfund LLC, a risk-management provider, agreed to add
            Uganda to their global Water Cost Index, the first African
            member of the investing tool the companies announced in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement with Uganda's Ministry of Water and
            Environment will let IBM collect data to calculate the cost of
            producing water, in dollars per cubic meter, said Peter Williams, chief technology officer of Big Green
            Innovations at
            IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global water use has grown at more than twice the rate of
            population increase over the last century, according to the
            United Nations. A growing number of nations are turning to the
            private sector to build and maintain water networks, and
            information such as the water index may facilitate investment,
            Williams said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The primary purpose is to enable more capital investment
            in a sector that desperately needs it,' Williams said today in
            an interview from Uganda. 'This is not a price index -- it's a
            cost index. The price that you charge for water is an entirely
            different decision than the cost of getting it there in the
            first place.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first version of the index will be released next month
            with information from about a half-dozen nations, he said. 'The
            goal is to build it out to 25 percent of the world's GDP.' The
            index will also include countries in Asia and the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China Said to Study IBM Servers for Bank Security Risks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Chinese government is reviewing whether domestic banks' reliance on high-end servers from
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) compromises the nation's financial security, people familiar
            with the matter said, in an escalation of the dispute with the U.S. over spying claims. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Government
            agencies, including the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance, are asking banks to remove the
            IBM servers and replace them with a local brand as part of a trial program, said the four people, who asked
            not to be identified because the review hasn't been made public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The review comes a week
            after American prosecutors indicted five Chinese military officers for allegedly hacking into the computers
            of U.S. companies and stealing secrets, while former contractor Edward Snowden's revelations last June of a
            National Security Agency spying program already hurt U.S. technology sales in China. Last week, China's
            government said it will vet technology companies operating in the country, while the Financial Times
            reported May 25 that China ordered state-owned companies to cut ties with U.S. consulting firms. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Challenger Inspur Woos China Customers Amid Dispute</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese server maker Inspur Group Ltd. started a campaign to lure customers from International
            Business Machines Corp. as the government studies if domestic banks' reliance on IBM technology threatens
            national security. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jinan-based Inspur this week unveiled its 'IBM to Inspur' initiative
            aimed at taking the U.S. company's market share in China, said a member of Inspur's marketing department who
            asked not to be named citing company policy. Inspur hired more than 80 employees from IBM's hardware arm, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move may help Inspur capitalize on a growing dispute with the U.S. after
            prosecutors there charged five Chinese military officers with allegedly hacking American companies. Toppling
            IBM in China would be a major challenge for Inspur, whose reported 36.7 billion yuan ($5.9 billion) of
            revenue in 2011 was equivalent to 5.5 percent of IBM's sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There aren't that many
            alternatives for high-end banking servers, so it's quite hard to find replacements,' Arthur Hsieh, an
            analyst at UBS in Taiwan, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The People's Bank of China, the Ministry of
            Finance and other government agencies are reviewing domestic banks' use of IBM servers and expanding a trial
            program to replace them with homegrown ones, four people familiar with the matter said May 27. China Postal
            Savings Bank Co. is using Inspur servers as part of the trial, which began in March 2013, the people said.

            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
            is working with Beijing TransWiseway Information Technology Co.
            to offer drivers in China more connectivity in their vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's cloud-based technology will connect vehicles to the
            Internet and each other to deliver information such as traffic
            alerts, weather advisories and suggestions for alternate routes
            to a driver's mobile phone, the companies said today in a
            statement. The new platform may connect with 1.5 million trucks
            next year and 10 million in two to three years, the companies
            estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Drivers are increasingly looking to be connected while in
            their vehicles. Technology to do that is the top selling point
            for 39 percent of auto buyers, more than twice the 14 percent
            who say their first consideration is traditional performance
            measures such as power and speed, according to a study
            consulting firm Accenture released in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This effort targeted for improving in-vehicle services
            will make an important impact on the whole driving ecosystem in
            China and combining mobile and cloud technologies will drive
            innovation across the automotive industry,' said Ernie Hu, vice
            president of software for the IBM Greater China Group. IBM is
            based in Armonk, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's collaboration for the connected car in China is being
            announced as tensions between the world's two largest economies
            have escalated after U.S. prosecutors accused the Chinese
            military of stealing corporate secrets. China's government is
            studying whether domestic banks' reliance on IBM's high-end
            servers threatens national security and is expanding a trial
            program to replace them with local brands, people familiar with
            the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM to Offer 'Jeopardy!' Winner Watson as Cloud App Tool</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines
            Corp.'s Watson technology, famous for outsmarting humans on the
            game show 'Jeopardy!,' will be offered as a cloud-based tool
            to application developers, letting them tap a resource capable
            of giving everything from shopping tips to medical advice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Programmers will be able to access the IBM Watson
            Developers Cloud, an online marketplace with resources for
            developing apps, use a content store with data from third-party
            providers and get help from IBM and contracted professionals,
            the Armonk, New York-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is so much more that can be accomplished by drawing
            on the creativity of individuals, organizations, entrepreneurs,
            startups and established businesses that truly innovate every
            day on their own,' said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson
            Solutions, in an interview. 'Watson can be this ultimate
            assistant to help individuals get their questions answered and
            their problems solved.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Opening up the Watson platform to outside developers is
            IBM's latest step to commercialize the technology as it tries to
            boost revenue from cloud computing amid a decline in its
            hardware business. Watson, which can answer questions after
            being preloaded with documents and websites, has been deployed
            in the health and finance markets since its debut on the
            'Jeopardy!' in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;App Developers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Application developers, from startups to established
            businesses, can submit their requests to use Watson's services
            on IBM's website beginning this week, said Lori Bosio, a
            spokeswoman for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There are no upfront cost for access and partners who use
            the service in their apps will be charged on a metered usage
            model, Gold said. He declined to comment on expected sales from
            the service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three apps developed on the cloud-based platform are
            targeted to enter the market early next year, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MD Buyline, a company that provides supply-chain services
            for hospitals and health-care systems, will introduce its
            Hippocrates app to let clinical and financial users make 'real-time, informed decisions,' according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fluid Inc., an e-commerce services company, will offer its
            Fluid Expert Personal Shopper app to help consumers with
            purchase decisions. Welltok Inc.'s CafeWell Concierge app will
            combine users' input and Watson's ability to learn to create
            personalized health plans catered to an individual's needs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The introduction of the Watson cloud service follows six
            quarters of declining revenue for IBM, underpinned by slumping
            sales in its hardware business. The company said it generated
            more than $1 billion in revenue from cloud products and services
            in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We really believe in the future opportunity it represents
            in a revenue and upside perspective,' Gold said of the Watson
            cloud service. 'This is clearly IBM's most prized possession
            that we are opening up to the world.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bharat Light Partners IBM to Boost India Wind Farm Output</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Draper Fisher Jurvetson-backed
            Bharat Light Power Pvt. and International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) are combining efforts to boost the electricity output of
            wind farms in India, seeking to expand capacity fivefold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under a 10-year agreement, IBM's technology will raise the
            profitability of Bharat Light projects by better managing wind-farm data, said Balki Iyer, chief development
            officer of the
            renewable developer founded by the former country head of
            General Electric Co. (GE), Tejpreet S. Chopra. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clean-energy utilities such as Bharat Light and Morgan
            Stanley-backed Continuum Wind Energy Pte are sparking a shift in
            India's wind industry by focusing on maximizing generation as
            they compete against fossil-fuel plants to deliver power. India,
            fighting blackouts that restrain its growth, is trying to cut
            dependence on imported fossil fuels and double clean energy
            capacity to about 59 gigawatts by 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These projects are usually located in very remote parts
            of India and the level of intelligence dispatched from the field
            is low,' Iyer said today in a phone interview. The
            collaboration with IBM will allow Bharat Light to generate power
            at levels 'way beyond' what wind farms, often managed by
            turbine suppliers in India, currently can do, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wind farms are already able to supply power at the same
            cost or cheaper than new coal-fired plants in some Indian
            states. That trend was helped by falling turbine prices, down a
            quarter from their 2009 peak amid global oversupply, as well as
            newer machines that produce more power at lower wind speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Operational Efficiencies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is only so much you can do to improve existing
            turbines,' Iyer said. In contrast, raising the operational
            efficiency of remote wind farms by just 1 percent can lead to a
            'huge' increase in revenue. Continuum Wind Chief Executive
            Officer Arvind Bansal said Oct. 29 that generation losses at
            Indian wind projects can be reduced from 6 percent to less than
            1 percent by managing assets better. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clean-energy utilities such as Bharat Light, backed by
            Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm Draper Fisher
            Jurvetson, which bet early on such companies as Skype Inc., and
            Continuum are expanding faster than traditional wind-farm
            investors that are exiting the market after the expiration of a
            tax break. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of India's 20,000 megawatts of wind capacity was built
            claiming tax breaks, leading to small holdings that owners often
            allowed to rust and idle once the depreciation benefits were
            claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's technology will also help Bharat Light comply more
            easily with a government directive on July 15 that ordered wind
            farms to forecast day-ahead power output or face fines, Iyer
            said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s ReNew Wind Power Pvt. and Tata
            Power Co. (TPWR) say the rule would wipe out industry profits because
            it's too difficult to meet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asset Acquisitions? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's fragmented wind industry is ripe for mergers and
            acquisitions as indebted companies such as property developer
            DLF Ltd. and truck maker Ashok Leyland sell off wind portfolios
            built for tax breaks, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
            Such assets can be bought for less than half the cost of
            building a new wind farm, according to Mumbai-based developer
            Ushdev Power Holdings Pvt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharat Light owns about 200 megawatts of operating wind
            farms, including 150 megawatts of capacity acquired from DLF in
            July. It plans to diversify into solar, biomass and hydropower
            to reach 1,000 megawatts in five years through acquisitions and
            by building projects, Iyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The developer is in talks with potential overseas investors
            to help fund that growth, he said, declining to elaborate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is combining efforts with Bharat Light in 'a sunrise
            industry,' Ajoy Menon, a director at IBM in India, said by
            phone. 'We're betting on renewables.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Druckenmiller Shorting IBM in Bet Cloud Computing to Win</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stan Druckenmiller, who has one of
            the best track records in the hedge-fund industry over the past
            three decades, said he's betting against the shares of
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) because the company's
            business will be replaced by technology such as cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's one of the more higher-probability shorts I have
            seen in years,' Druckenmiller, 60, said in an interview with
            Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle at the Robin Hood Investors
            Conference in New York today. 'IBM is old technology being
            replaced by cloud technology.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.9 percent to $180.53 at 3:07 p.m. in New York.
            James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
            didn't immediately respond a phone call and e-mail requesting
            comment on Druckenmiller' wager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's sales have dropped for six straight quarters as the
            growth of services such as cloud computing have failed to make
            up for slowing demand for older businesses like hardware. The
            company is selling less-profitable divisions and is devoting
            cash to stock repurchases to help reach its forecast for growth
            in earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM said last month that it added $15 billion to its
            buyback plan, part of Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty's
            plan to achieve $20 in adjusted earnings a share by 2015, up
            from $15.25 last year. The hardware unit, which makes servers
            and other devices for business users, reported a loss last
            quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Druckenmiller Bets Against IBM as Cloud Technology Wins</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stan Druckenmiller, who has one of
            the best track records in the hedge-fund industry over the past
            three decades, said he's betting against shares of International
            Business Machines Corp. (IBM) while wagering on younger technology
            companies such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'IBM is old technology being replaced by cloud
            technology,' Druckenmiller, 60, said in an interview with
            Bloomberg TV's Stephanie Ruhle at the Robin Hood Investors
            Conference in New York yesterday. 'It's one of the more higher-probability shorts I have seen in years.'
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales at the 102-year-old IBM have dropped for six straight
            quarters as the growth of services such as cloud computing have
            failed to make up for slowing demand for older businesses like
            hardware. The company is selling less-profitable divisions and
            is devoting cash to stock repurchases to help reach its forecast
            for growth in earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said he's betting on Amazon, and praised
            Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who founded the online
            retailer in 1994. Amazon's Web Services division, whose server
            farms generate the processing power the retailer sells to heavy
            corporate data users on the cheap, 'is killing it,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bezos is a 'serial monopolist,' Druckenmiller said. IBM
            should be investing in its business and taking on the
            'challenge of the Amazons of the world' instead of doing share
            buybacks, according to Druckenmiller. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM fell 1.5 percent to close at $181.30 yesterday in New
            York. James Sciales, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM,
            didn't respond to a phone call and e-mail requesting comment on
            Druckenmiller's wager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Buyback Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM lost 5.4 percent this year, compared with a 27 percent
            gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index and a 48 percent
            increase for Amazon. If IBM ends the year in negative territory,
            it will be its first annual decline since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM said last month that it added $15 billion to its
            buyback plan, part of CEO Ginni Rometty's plan to achieve $20 in
            adjusted earnings a share by 2015, up from $15.25 last year. The
            hardware unit, which makes servers and other devices for
            business users, reported a loss last quarter. Rometty took over
            as CEO in January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's backers include billionaire Warren Buffett, who has
            said long-term investors should root for IBM shares to languish
            in the short term, giving it a lower price to repurchase stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said that while he has great respect for
            Buffett, he isn't known for tech investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think technology is his area of expertise,'
            Druckenmiller said. 'He has often said that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Recommending Google &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller described Google Inc. as the most
            'innovative company on the planet,' citing the company's web-enabled eyeglasses and self-driving cars. He
            said investors who
            want to bet on innovation should buy shares of Google and those
            who want to bet against innovation should buy IBM shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller, a former chief strategist for billionaire
            George Soros, shut his hedge-fund firm three years ago and now
            manages his own wealth through his Duquesne Family Office LLC.
            From 1986 through 2010, he produced average annual returns of 30
            percent at his hedge fund Duquesne Capital Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said that while his returns over the last 10
            years were 'very subpar,' they are superior to the returns
            currently in the market. Hedge funds have returned an average of
            6.9 percent this year through October, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller said he doesn't share hedge-fund manager
            David Tepper's view that the stock market offers a 'no-brainer
            opportunity' for investors. Still, Druckenmiller said he
            doesn't see anything to change the rising trend of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said in September that he had only a few small trades on
            as he waited to see who might replace Federal Reserve Chairman
            Ben S. Bernanke when he steps down at the end of January. Vice
            Chairman Janet Yellen has since been nominated to the post and
            is awaiting confirmation by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In May, Druckenmiller said investors should bet against the
            Australian dollar. The currency has since fallen about 9.8
            percent against the U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>NYC Joins With IBM to Create Web Portal for Technology Startups</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;New York City is partnering with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to create a website to
            help technology startup companies connect with investors, industry leaders and job applicants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Called Digital.NYC, the portal will serve as a hub where entrepreneurs can find information and
            resources, Mayor Bill de Blasio said today at a press briefing in Brooklyn. The website includes job
            listings, a citywide database of more than 6,000 technology companies and investors, and an interactive
            calendar of events. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The site was built by New York-based Gust, a company whose web
            platform offers a way for startups to share information with angel investors. It uses Bluemix, IBM's cloud
            technology. Digital.NYC was developed in collaboration with the New York City Economic Development Corp.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM Tries to Adapt. Again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This is the first of its kind anywhere in
            the world, a public-private partnership to really bring all of the aspects of the industry together,' de
            Blasio said at the press briefing in the Dumbo section, home to some of New York's newest startups. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The site uses data and content from technology and media companies including CourseHorse,
            WayWire.com, The Muse, Uncubed, AlleyWatch, General Assembly, Flatiron School, Meetup.com and the New York
            Daily News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;De Blasio was joined by Robert LeBlanc, senior vice president of software
            and cloud solutions at Armonk, New York-based IBM, and Minerva Tantoco, who was named the city's first chief
            technology officer last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digital.NYC expands on the city's Made in NY Digital Map
            from 2012 and the We Are Made in NY campaign introduced in 2013. Both were created by the administration of
            former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP. &lt;/p&gt;

            after trading closed yesterday. That was $1 billion less than
            analysts had estimated, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's shift to higher-margin software and services has
            failed to make up for a slump in sales of servers and other
            computer hardware. Even the company's traditional growth markets
            -- developing economies overseas, including China -- aren't
            helping prop up sales. IBM posted the first revenue decrease in
            those markets in its history last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'IBM has been challenged with changing the model on the
            hardware front, and now the growth markets are a surprise
            drop,' said Chris Ambrose, an analyst at Gartner Inc. While
            pursuing higher-margin markets is the right move, 'they still
            have to show revenue growth at some point,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM shares fell 6.4 percent to $174.83 at the close in New
            York. The stock is now trading at its lowest price in more than
            two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company lost $713 million in its hardware business in
            the first nine months of this year, compared with $253 million
            in profit in the year-earlier period. Revenue from growth
            markets shrank 9 percent last quarter. Chinese sales tumbled
            more than 20 percent as the country worked on a plan for
            economic policy, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on
            a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is reassigning James Bramante, who had overseen the
            emerging-markets business, to a position it has yet to announce,
            a person with knowledge of the matter said today. Bruno Di Leo,
            who formerly ran the growth-markets unit and is now head of
            sales, well be in charge of setting up a new team to oversee the
            division, said the person, who asked not to be identified
            because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To make up for the slowdown, the company is looking to
            cloud computing -- the delivery of software and services online
            -- and it divulged revenue from that market for the first time
            yesterday. IBM said it generated more than $1 billion in revenue
            from cloud products and services in the quarter. The disclosure
            follows an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission into the finances surrounding IBM's cloud business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Tax Advantage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income rose 5.7 percent to $4 billion, or $3.68 a
            share, from $3.8 billion, or $3.33, a year earlier. Excluding
            some items, earnings were $3.99 a share in the period, topping
            the $3.96 predicted by analysts. That number was helped by a
            lower-than-anticipated tax rate of 17 percent, down 7.7 points
            from a year ago. The company got a boost from foreign tax audits
            and the divestiture of a retail store business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The more favorable tax rate contributed 30 cents to
            earnings, David Grossman, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus Co.,
            said in a note to investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'IBM has always viewed the tax rate as an operational
            lever,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is working to rid itself of commodity products,
            shifting instead toward software-focused businesses that
            generate higher profit margins. IBM yesterday reiterated its
            goal of reaching $20 a share in earnings by 2015, up from $15.25
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trusteer Purchase &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM agreed to sell off its customer-service unit to Synnex
            Corp. (SNX) for $505 million in September. It's also spending more
            than $800 million to buy Trusteer Inc., a software security
            company, people familiar with the deal said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July, IBM acquired SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a cloud-computing storage provider that will
            help it compete with
            Amazon.com Inc. It paid almost $2 billion this year for the
            Dallas-based company, said a person with knowledge of the
            transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's hardware business continued to drag the company down,
            with revenue declining 17 percent in the third quarter. Chief
            Executive Officer Ginni Rometty shook up the management of the
            division in April, replacing Rod Adkins with Tom Rosamilia, who
            had been overseeing corporate strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are taking action to improve execution in our growth
            markets unit and in the elements of our hardware businesses that
            are under performing,' Rometty said in yesterday's statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company had also been trying to sell parts of its
            server division to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), before discussions broke
            down in early May due to disagreements over price, people
            familiar with the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, IBM spent $1 billion to restructure
            its workforce, cutting more than 3,300 jobs in the U.S. and
            Canada alone, according to Alliance@IBM, an employee group.
            Loughridge, the company's finance chief, said earlier this year
            that divestitures will make up for that expense. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Said to Reassign Emerging-Markets Head After Sales Slump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) is reassigning James Bramante, who had overseen its
            emerging-markets business, after a drop in the unit's sales,
            according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bruno Di Leo, who formerly ran IBM's growth markets and is
            now head of sales, will be in charge of setting up a new team to
            oversee the unit, said the person, who asked not to be
            identified because the information is private. Bramante's new
            position has yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue in the division fell 9 percent in the third quarter
            from a year earlier, dragged down by a 22 percent decline in
            China, where the government was revamping its economic policy,
            Armonk, New York-based IBM said yesterday. The performance
            helped contribute to the sixth straight quarterly decline in
            total sales for the world's biggest computer-services company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the growth markets organization, the leadership team
            that established that to begin with and drove that organization
            is now back in the cockpit, led by Bruno Di Leo and his
            leadership team,' IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
            said yesterday on a conference call. 'They know how to get this
            done.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James Sciales, an IBM spokesman, didn't immediately respond
            to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While growth in the emerging-markets unit -- which also
            includes India and countries in Africa and the Middle East --
            typically exceeds developed markets by 8 to 10 percentage
            points, it trailed them for the first time this quarter,
            Loughridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Shuffle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The executive change is Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty's second major leadership shuffle
            this year. In April,
            she appointed Tom Rosamilia, who had been overseeing corporate
            strategy, to take charge of the hardware division, replacing Rod Adkins. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hardware business continues to drag the company down,
            with revenue declining 17 percent in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bramante's reassignment was reported earlier today by the
            Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM fell 6.4 percent to $174.83 at the close in New York
            for the biggest decline since April. The shares have slipped 8.7
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Companies from IBM to Starbucks are struggling with new obstacles in China as Communist Party
            officials tussle over the direction and depth of economic reforms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China's
            state-controlled media last week accused Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) with charging too much for coffee and said
            Samsung Electronics Co.'s smartphones don't work properly. International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) IBM's
            China revenue slipped 22 percent in the third quarter, contributing to the first-ever sales decline in the
            company's growth-markets division, as state-owned companies started delaying orders, including mainframes
            and servers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The operating environment for foreign firms has deteriorated in the last
            year in a serious way,' said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. 'In
            my 16 years in China, it's some of the worst business sentiment among foreign executives. They don't feel as
            welcome as they used to.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based trade
            group, surveyed U.S. executives this month, the chief complaints included rising costs and bureaucratic red
            tape. Almost 70 percent of the more than 100 U.S. firms polled said profit margin would be flat or narrow
            this year. Only 39 percent are optimistic about the next five years in China; 58 percent felt that way in
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM Adds $15 Billion Buyback After Six-Quarter Sales Slump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) added $15 billion to its buyback plan as it reduces stock
            in circulation to increase earnings per share with sales
            continuing to decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board authorized the funding today along with its
            quarterly dividend, according to a statement from the world's
            largest computer-services provider. With the addition, the
            company now has $20.6 billion in its repurchase program, and it
            will request more next October, it said. IBM's market value is
            about $199 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is rewarding
            shareholders who held on as the stock fell 7.4 percent this year
            through yesterday, compared with the 24 percent gain in the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index. With sales dropping, the company is
            counting on the buyback to help reach its goal of $20 in
            adjusted earnings a share by 2015, up from $15.25 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is one of the biggest tools they have to increase
            earnings per share if their growth rate is flat,' said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress
            Financial
            Partners, who doesn't own IBM shares. 'If they're not growing,
            they can reduce their share count.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales have fallen for six straight quarters, and IBM's
            hardware unit reported a loss for the three months that ended in
            September. At the same time, earnings have continued to climb.
            In addition to buying back shares, IBM has sold less-profitable
            businesses, acquired more lucrative software companies and
            lowered its tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;

            Corp. (IBM) abandoned its court fight with Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) over
            a $600 million cloud computing contract for the U.S. Central
            Intelligence Agency, citing the government's urgency to begin
            work on the project. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM withdrew its bid for a stay of U.S. Court of Claims
            Judge Thomas Wheeler's Oct. 8 ruling in favor of Amazon after
            the Justice Department said in court papers that further delay
            in resolving the contract would bring 'harm to the United
            States' and create 'significant challenges' for the CIA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amazon sued the U.S. in July after the Government
            Accountability Office, the agency that makes recommendations on
            challenges to contracts, sided with IBM and agreed that the CIA
            had failed to properly evaluate prices and had waived a contract
            requirement only for Seattle-based Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In light of the government's recent submissions
            emphasizing its need to move forward on the contract, IBM has
            withdrawn its motion,' Clint Roswell, an IBM spokesman, said in
            a statement. 'IBM maintains its position that the GAO's
            findings were appropriate.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Roswell declined to say what further action on the
            contract, if any, Armonk, New York-based IBM would pursue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mary Osako, a spokeswoman for Amazon, didn't immediately
            respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM's 2.5 Billion-Euro Bond Offering Fuels U.S. Debt Sales Surge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) is marketing its biggest ever bond sale in euros, fueling
            the busiest week for deals in the currency by U.S. borrowers in
            six months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest computer-services provider is marketing
            2.5 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of seven- and 12-year
            securities after Procter Gamble Co. (PG) and Coca-Cola Enterprises
            Inc. (CCE) sold a combined 1.1 billion euros of debt this week. The
            average yield on investment-grade bonds in euros fell to a four-month low of 2 percent, 118 basis points
            below dollar rates,
            according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. companies are seeking to lock in lower borrowing costs
            as the European Central Bank pledged to hold down interest rates
            to support the region's nascent economic recovery. The Federal
            Reserve fueled speculation it will begin scaling back stimulus
            sooner than previously expected, with policy makers saying
            yesterday the U.S. economy is showing signs of 'underlying
            strength.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Companies can raise funds quite a lot cheaper in
            Europe,' said Jens Vanbrabant, lead money manager at London-based investment firm ECM Asset Management Ltd.,
            which has $8.6
            billion in credit under management and will invest in IBM's
            seven-year bonds. 'Yields are a lot higher in the U.S. because
            the tapering sell-off was much stronger there. This should
            continue because the U.S. economy is growing faster, there is
            more focus on tapering and potential rising yields.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Two-Part Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is marketing 1.5 billion euros of notes maturing
            November 2020 to yield 42 basis points more than the mid-swap
            rate. It's also offering 1 billion euros of securities due
            November 2025 with a spread of 68 basis points, according to a
            person familiar with the matter. The Armonk, New York-based
            company last sold debt in euros in November 2012, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The euro market is strong and the conditions were right
            to access the market,' said Doug Shelton, a spokesman for IBM
            in New York. Proceeds from the bond sale will be used for
            general corporate purposes, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average spread investors demand to hold high-grade
            bonds in euros dropped to 80 basis points more than swaps, the
            lowest in five weeks, according to Bloomberg bond index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'European bond investors are hungry for issuance as
            European corporates reduced their net borrowings this year in
            the wake of rating downgrades and austerity,' said Georg Grodzki, head of credit research at Legal General
            Investment
            Management in London. 'By contrast, U.S. corporates are
            massively buying back shares and need to raise more debt.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;PIK Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in European credit markets, AA Group Ltd., the
            roadside recovery and insurance division of Folkestone, England-based Acromas Holdings Ltd., sold
            payment-in-kind toggle notes
            to refinance existing debt, according to a person familiar with
            the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AA issued 350 million pounds ($561 million) of six-year
            senior PIK toggle notes yielding 9.5 percent through its AA PIK
            Co. Ltd. unit, the person said. The notes, which can be bought
            back by the company after 1 1/2 years, give borrowers the option

            marketing 250 million euros of convertible notes paying a coupon
            of 4 percent to refinance debt, according to a regulatory

        <headline>IBM Moves Retirees to Insurance Exchange as Costs Rise</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), faced with rising health care costs for retirees, says it
            will move them to a health exchange where they may have cheaper
            plan options. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move affects about 110,000 Medicare-eligible retirees,
            Doug Shelton, an IBM spokesman, said by telephone. The company
            has chosen the Extend Health exchange by Towers Watson, the
            country's largest private Medicare exchange, to provide more
            options for prescription drug, dental and vision care, the
            Armonk, New York-based company said in a statement e-mailed
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM's move is the latest in a string of large changes that
            organizations have made to counter rising health costs. In
            August, United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) decided to drop health
            benefits for 15,000 of its workers' spouses, while Michigan
            Governor Rick Snyder tried to reduce costs by moving municipal
            retirees to exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This transition provides more choice and flexibility at
            equal or better costs to our retirees,' IBM said in the
            statement. 'While some retirees may be skeptical today, studies
            show that the majority of people who are presented the concept
            of an exchange are skeptical at first, but once they understand
            the options available to them through these exchanges, they have
            a more positive outlook.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>GE, IBM Ending Retiree Health Plans in Historic Shift</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;America's biggest employers, from GE to IBM, are increasingly moving retirees to insurance
            exchanges where they select their own health plans, an historic shift that could push more costs onto U.S.
            taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc. (TWX) yesterday said it would steer retired workers toward a
            privately run exchange, days after a similar announcement by International Business Machines Corp. General
            Electric Co. (GE) last year said it, too, would curb benefits in a move that may send some former employees
            to the public insurance exchanges created under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            retiree health benefits have been shrinking for years, the newest cutbacks may quickly become the norm.
            About 44 percent of companies plan to stop administering health plans for their former workers over the next
            two years, a survey last month by consultant Towers Watson Co. (TW) found. Retirees are concerned their
            costs may rise, while analysts predict benefits will decline in some cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Things are
            going to change dramatically,' said Ron Fontanetta, a partner at New York-based Towers Watson, which advises
            GE and other large companies. 'Over the next two to three years, we see a much more aggressive rethinking of
            what employers are going to provide.' &lt;/p&gt;

            General Electric said last year that it would close its retiree plan to new entrants starting Jan. 1, 2015.

        <headline>IBM's Deep Blue Stuns Chess King; 'stop. reset.': Correct</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;All 55,000 square feet of the Park
            Avenue Armory's Wade Thompson Drill Hall are focused on a table
            not much bigger than the chess board atop it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's more than a world chess championship at stake in
            'The Machine,' Matt Charman's play based on the 1997 re-match
            between grandmaster Garry Kasparov and 'Deep Blue,' the
            computer that IBM (IBM) built to beat him. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kasparov won the first duel a year earlier, and Deep Blue
            returned with a chip on its shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hall is tricked-out like a Las Vegas boxing arena, with
            giant scoreboard, digital video screens and color commentators
            bloviating from the wings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All of which provides plenty of sizzle for very little
            steak: As the match unfolds, Charman's paint-by-numbers script
            skips back in time to the parallel stories of Azerbaijan-born
            Kasparov (the nuanced Hadley Fraser) and the computer's chief
            developer, Taiwan emigre Feng-Hsiung Hsu (Kenneth Lee, good in a
            more one-note role). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kasparov is a genius with mommy issues (the forceful
            Francesca Annis). Hsu ignores his pretty cheerleader girlfriend
            from Carnegie-Mellon (Antonia Bernath). Their passion lies
            elsewhere, you see. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charman toys with the idea that the man-versus-machine
            showdown served a public relations purpose above all. But an
            outsize set (Lucy Osborne) and snappy video (Andrzej Goulding)
            don't justify blowing such an intimate encounter so wildly out
            of proportion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Josie Rourke's staging atomizes these gladiators, and the
            echo-chamber sound doesn't amplify the themes so much as render
            them unintelligible. (Rating: **1/2) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'stop. reset' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the Signature Theatre, Regina Taylor's 'stop. reset.'
            moves the techno theme a few decades closer to the present. Set
            in the Chicago headquarters of a black publishing company that's
            been taken over by a conglomerate with the bottom line
            paramount, it's a timely meditation on the gloomy outlook for
            books -- real ones, with pages and spines and ink -- in the
            digital age. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carl Lumbly is stirring as Alexander Ames, the aging, up-from-poverty patriarch. Even better is
            Ismael Cruz Cordova as
            'J,' a window washer with dreams and, it seems, a direct link
            not only to the World Wide Web, but to the tech future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Best yet is Neil Patel and Shawn Sagady's elegant design,
            playing with projections of words, quotations and a Windy City
            blizzard. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taylor, who also directs, is not in control of her
            material, which goes seriously off the rails after Alexander and
            J connect. The play spins out into digital entropy that's more
            nonsense than the sad, surrealistic endgame it means to suggest.

        <headline>Continental Teams Up With IBM to Cooperate on Automated Driving</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Continental AG (CON), Europe's second-largest auto-parts maker, is teaming up with International
            Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to develop technology that puts the
            Internet in the driver's seat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Continental, based in Hanover, Germany, and Armonk, New
            York-based IBM, agreed to create a multimedia platform that
            controls functions such as mobility and navigation, the
            companies said at the International Auto Show in Frankfurt
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The partnership comes five weeks after Continental
            announced a cooperation with Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), the biggest
            maker of networking equipment, to develop technology to connect
            vehicles to the Internet. Web connectivity has become critical
            for carmakers as customers demand vehicles with more technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'IBM's experience in cloud-enabled platforms and embedded
            systems development capabilities, combined with our systems
            expertise in automotive electronics, create the foundation for a
            new generation of intelligent networked vehicles,' Continental
            Chief Executive Officer Elmar Degenhart said at a press
            conference. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The technology will be designed to help cars communicate
            with each other, steer their way better through traffic and
            'literally look around the corner,' the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler AG (DAI) provides live traffic
            information and a Wi-Fi hotspot in its new-generation Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan. Backed by an array of 12
            ultrasonic
            detectors, five cameras and six radar sensors, the 79,800-euro
            ($104,630) S-Class can match the speed of the car in front of
            it, even coming to a complete stop and steering to stay in the
            lane. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) has been testing self-driving cars for several
            years, putting its own technology into existing car models. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The boom is just starting,' Ralf Lenninger, a manager of
            Continental's interior divison, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UniCredit Sees $961 Million Savings in 10 Years in IBM Venture</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UniCredit SpA (UCG), Italy's biggest
            bank, forecast savings of 725 million euros ($961 million) in 10
            years from a joint venture with International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM) to outsource information-technology systems. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'UniCredit's partnership will allow the bank to have
            significant savings at not material costs,' UniCredit Deputy
            General Manager Paolo Fiorentino said at a press conference in
            Milan today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Value Transformation Services, the joint venture in which
            IBM holds a 51 percent stake, will operate in Italy, Germany,
            Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, he said.
            Milan-based UniCredit will transfer 700 workers to the new
            venture as part of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UniCredit and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, agreed in
            July to improve the bank's infrastructure services as part of a
            plan, dubbed Newton Program, to cut costs and increase revenue
            through strategic partnerships. UniCredit Chief Executive
            Officer Federico Ghizzoni said last month he plans to reduce
            costs by 1 billion euros more than the 15.8 billion euros
            previously targeted by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IBM to Sell Customer-Care Unit to Synnex for $505 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
            Corp. (IBM), the world's largest computer-services provider, agreed to
            sell its customer-care outsourcing business to Synnex Corp. (SNX) for
            $505 million to focus on more profitable investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Synnex will pay $430 million in cash and $75 million in
            stock, giving IBM a stake in Synnex, the companies said in
            statements yesterday. The unit had $1.3 billion in 2012 sales,
            accounting for more than 1 percent of IBM's revenue. Synnex
            shares jumped to a record intraday price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM is getting rid of businesses with lower profit margins
            to reach a goal of $20 a share in earnings by 2015, up from
            $15.25 last year. The company last year sold its retail-store
            systems unit to Toshiba Tec Corp. (6588) for $850 million. IBM has had
            talks with Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) about selling its division that
            makes standard X86 servers, which have become a commodity item
            amid increasing competition, people familiar with the matter
            said earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As you look at our strategy, we continue to move our
            business and transform our business to the higher-value
            spaces,' said Lori Steele, general manager of IBM Global
            Process Services, in an interview. 'We're trying to focus on
            software and analytics.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, based in Armonk, New York, said earlier this
            year that it would sell assets to make up for a $1 billion
            charge to cut jobs. IBM excluded the charge from its 2013
            earnings forecast, saying future divestitures would make up for
            the expense. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lower Margins &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The customer service unit had a gross profit margin of
            about 20 percent, IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
            said in a presentation to investors earlier this year. That
            compares with margins of about 60 percent for newer businesses
            like analytics and cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Synnex, based in Fremont, California, said the transaction
            will add 55 cents in earnings per share in the first 12 months
            after it closes the deal. Its shares jumped more than 20 percent
            to $57.59 at the close in New York, an all-time high. IBM rose
            2.2 percent to $190.70. &lt;/p&gt;

            Corp. (IBM) is marketing its Watson analytics technology to rank-and-file workers across a swath of
            industries as it seeks to
            encourage broader adoption of cloud-based data products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is making available a standard version of its
            data-crunching service, first unveiled in January, as a product
            for clients like banks and pharmaceutical companies. The
            software will be offered in a basic free format, with paid
            features such as additional storage or connecting different
            sources of data, said Alistair Rennie, IBM's general manager of
            business analytics, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IBM has been trying to commercialize its Watson tool, which
            lets users ask questions in plain English language and analyze
            data for patterns, by showing how it can be used for tasks such
            as customer service and cooking. The company has been investing
            in analytics software like Watson, famous for winning the
            'Jeopardy!' TV show, amid a slump in demand for hardware that
            has led to nine straight quarters of falling sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Outreach to the individual through digital methods is a
            critical element to getting these tools to as many people as
            possible,' Rennie said. 'We're convinced more people will love
            it and will want more advanced capabilities.' &lt;/p&gt;

            in the U.S., or CFIUS, in August. The review was conducted
            during a dispute between the world's two largest economies over
            cybersecurity after U.S. prosecutors in May accused five Chinese
            military officials of stealing trade secrets and other
            information from American companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After completing the deal, IBM will be rid of a less-profitable business, allowing it to focus on
            growing areas such
            as cloud computing and data analytics, while Lenovo gains a
            larger piece of the global computing-hardware market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Completion of the transaction will make Lenovo the third-largest server vendor in the world, behind
            Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)
            and Dell Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft, IBM Struggle to Manage Mobile-Computing Shift</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) (IBM), two architects of the
            U.S. computer industry, are feeling the pain as consumers and businesses flock to mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software company, yesterday reported no growth in Windows sales in
            its latest quarter, after accounting for upgrades sold in the past. IBM is struggling to boost hardware
            sales as more companies let employees use their own devices at work. Meanwhile Google Inc. (GOOG), which is
            expanding beyond its search-engine roots with Android software for smartphones and tablets, is keeping pace
            with the shift, reporting better-than-projected profits from mobile advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
            consumers check e-mail, browse the Web and watch television and movies on the go, PC shipments plummeted 14
            percent in the first quarter, the worst decline since researcher IDC began tracking data in 1994. Microsoft
            and others aren't moving fast enough to end their reliance on traditional computing, according to Brent
            Thill, an analyst at UBS Investment Bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's been a tough start to the year,' said
            San Francisco-based Thill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), which aims to
            generate 20 percent of sales outside the PC industry by the fourth quarter, forecast second-quarter sales
            yesterday that may surpass some analysts' estimates as it diversifies. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Russia to Reduce Reliance on Microsoft, IBM After Sanctions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's parliament is preparing new rules in a bid to cut its reliance on foreign technology
            suppliers after U.S. sanctions against some of the country's largest companies, a move that could hurt sales
            at vendors such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, is drafting a bill to require government agencies and
            state-run enterprises to give preference to local providers of software and hardware, according to a
            document from the commission for strategic information systems obtained by Bloomberg News. The paper
            addresses criteria for tender processes such as favoring products that don't have imported, licensed
            components. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This all has to do with sanctions,' Andrey Chernogorov, executive secretary
            of the commission, said in a phone interview. 'Given the current international tensions, substituting
            imports with local software and hardware becomes the key to ensuring self sufficiency.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Obama administration on July 16 tightened sanctions on Russian banks, energy and defense companies to punish
            the country over its interference in Ukraine. On the following day, the downing of a Malaysia Airlines jet
            caught in the military conflict, killing all 298 people on board, sent the Ukraine crisis into a new phase
            and raises the prospect of further sanctions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;H-P, Oracle &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard
            Co. (HP), IBM, Microsoft, Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Germany's SAP SE had combined
            revenue of 285 billion rubles ($8.1 billion) from Russia last year, according to estimates by the Russian
            Academy of Sciences that are included in the commission's document. Hewlett-Packard and IBM together
            accounted for almost 78 percent of the figure. About 77 percent of the total sales were contracts from the
            government and state-controlled companies, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for IBM and Oracle in the
            U.K. declined to comment on the planned law. Representatives for Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, SAP and Cisco
            didn't immediately return phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard
            slipped 0.5 percent at 9:48 a.m. in New York trading. IBM fell 1.2 percent, Microsoft lost 0.5 percent,
            Cisco dropped 0.1 percent and Oracle rose 0.3 percent. SAP lost 0.5 percent in Frankfurt trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission accelerated preparation for the bill after reports that American technology
            companies may cut off services to Russian banks and companies to comply with U.S. sanctions, Chernogorov
            said. The proposal may be submitted for a parliamentary vote in September, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rosneft,
            VEB &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among Russian companies the U.S. imposed lending curbs on last week are energy
            giants OAO Rosneft (ROSN) and OAO Novatek (NVTK) as well as Vnesheconombank and OAO Gazprombank. Since
            sanctions against Russia were first announced in March, President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called for
            substituting imports with domestic production to limit the threat to Russia's economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the lack of regulations in post-Soviet Russia that govern the award of technology contracts,
            foreign vendors account for 67 percent of software used in the country and about 90 percent of hardware,
            according to the commission. Foreign software may have hidden capabilities such as 'bugs' and 'backdoors,'
            giving suppliers access to confidential data, Chernogorov said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's Communications
            Ministry is among agencies seeking to cut dependence on foreign vendors as it develops its e-government
            initiative, a unified database of personal data used to provide online services such as granting a license
            permit or assigning a child to school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Local Production &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The idea
            of supporting local IT production is justified,' said Nikolay Komlev, executive director of the Russian
            Association of Computer and IT Enterprises, which represents multinationals such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard
            as well as Russian vendors. 'Still, its implementation proposed by State Duma may give a competitive
            advantage to not the most efficient companies.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's largest IT companies with
            annual revenue exceeding $1 billion include NCC, Lanit, Technoserv, NVision Group and IBS Group Holding Ltd.
            (IBSG), according to CNews Analytics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>
