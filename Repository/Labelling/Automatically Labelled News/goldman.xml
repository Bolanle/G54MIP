        <headline>Fortress Hires Goldman Sachs' Shell to Start Growth Equity Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) said
            it hired David Shell to start a new growth equity business for
            institutional investors at its Logan Circle Partners unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shell previously was co-chief investment officer of the
            growth equities investment team at Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management, where he was responsible for about $20 billion in
            client assets, New York-based Fortress said today in a
            statement. The appointment of Shell, who will be based in Tampa,
            Florida, marks the addition of institutional equities at Logan
            Circle, which manages about $21 billion across 15 fixed-income
            strategies, Fortress said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Seek Sale of NYSE Market-Making Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seeking a buyer for its New York Stock Exchange designated
            market-making business acquired through the 2000 purchase of Spear, Leeds Kellogg, a person briefed on the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank is in the early stages of the process and has held talks with
            potential buyers, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are private. The
            Financial Times reported on the planned sale earlier today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reaps
            the most revenue from equities trading among banks globally, paid about $5.4 billion in stock and cash for
            Spear Leeds. The purchase remains the biggest in the history of the firm, which is the world's largest
            adviser on mergers and acquisitions in 11 of the past 13 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The business for sale is now valued at about $30 million, the FT reported, citing
            analysts it didn't identify. Last year, Goldman Sachs agreed to sell a majority stake in its Redi
            trading-technology unit that was based on software acquired when it bought Spear Leeds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffany
            Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the company doesn't comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            NYSE, purchased in November by Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc., relies on traders known as
            designated market makers, or DMMs, to facilitate buying and selling. The firms help run the opening and
            closing auctions of NYSE-listed stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;IMC Financial Markets is in talks to
            buy Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s New York Stock Exchange market-making unit, two people familiar with the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is seeking as much as $30 million for the
            business, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the negotiations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. (ICE)'s NYSE relies on
            traders known as designated market markers, or DMMs, to
            facilitate the buying and selling of shares. Barclays Plc and
            KCG Holdings Inc. are the biggest DMMs, followed by Goldman
            Sachs and Virtu Financial Inc., according to a person with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IMC, which stands for International Marketmakers
            Combination, is a trading firm and asset manager founded in
            Amsterdam in 1989. It has U.S. offices in Chicago and New York,
            and trades on more than 90 exchanges around the world, according
            to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Remco Lenterman, an IMC managing director, and Tiffany Galvin of New York-based Goldman Sachs said
            their respective
            companies don't comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wiet Pot Said to Circle Back for Goldman's Trading Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wiet Pot, co-head of the Dutch high-speed trading firm that's said to be bidding for Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc.'s floor-trading business, is a former partner of the
            investment bank who once helped run its equities division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pot's IMC Financial Markets has expanded from Amsterdam to
            Chicago and Sydney, where it uses algorithms to make markets in
            stocks, commodities and currencies. Pot serves with Rob Defares,
            one of IMC's founders, as co-chief executive officer at IMC,
            which he joined in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The right to make markets on the New York Stock Exchange
            floor was once a license to mint money by collecting the
            customary 12.5-cent spread between purchases and sales. The
            huddles of traders at the Big Board have been shrinking since
            regulators allowed brokers to quote prices in pennies.
            Computerized traders like IMC are still able to eke out profits
            on the smaller spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two of the biggest high-frequency firms, Virtu Financial
            Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc., have already taken over much of what
            used to be called the specialist business, the niche that
            Goldman Sachs is now exiting. Goldman Sachs, which valued its
            market-making rights at $502 million in 2007, is seeking just
            $30 million for the operation, a person familiar with the matter
            has said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Nexans Fined by EU for Power Cable Cartel</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and a group
            of cable makers including Nexans SA (NEX) were fined a total of 301.6
            million euros ($416 million) by the European Union for fixing
            the price of high-voltage power cables sold to energy providers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shared a fine of 37.3 million euros with
            Prysmian SpA (PRY), an Italian cable maker that Goldman Sachs Capital
            Partners bought in 2005. Prysmian also shared a 67.3 million-euro fine with its former owner Pirelli C. SpA.
            (PC) Nexans SA, the
            world's second-biggest cable maker, was fined 70.7 million
            euros, less than the 200 million euros it had booked. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fines add to a 953 million-euro penalty for car-parts
            makers last month and a record 1.7 billion euros last year for
            banks and a broker that rigged interest-rate benchmarks.
            Breaking up cartels and levying high fines to deter price-fixing
            is one of the EU's priorities, according to Joaquin Almunia, the
            bloc's antitrust chief. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These companies knew very well that what they were doing
            was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great
            secrecy,' Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. 'Despite this
            and through joint efforts by several competition authorities
            around the world, we have detected their anti-competitive
            agreements and brought them to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is looking to sell its New York Stock Exchange market-making unit to
            a Dutch investment firm, as computers replace traders who once dominated the business at the corner of Wall
            and Broad streets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC Financial Markets is negotiating to buy the floor-trading
            business, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because talks are
            private. Goldman Sachs is seeking as much as $30 million, one person said. The investment bank, which joined
            the NYSE in 1896, bought the operations in 2000 as part of a $5.4 billion purchase of Spear, Leeds Kellogg.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NYSE's huddles of traders have been shrinking for years as more transactions are
            handled electronically, making humans less integral. Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc.
            pledged to preserve the trading floor in lower Manhattan when it agreed to buy the exchange in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The business has evolved away from humans on the exchange,' said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP
            Group Inc. 'Only a fraction is being done on the floor with humans versus how much is being done
            electronically.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC, which stands for International Marketmakers Combination, is a
            high-frequency trading firm and asset manager founded in Amsterdam in 1989. It has offices in Chicago and

        <headline>Goldman Gives Blankfein $6 Million Long-Term Incentive</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
            Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $6 million cash
            bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets,
            on top of $23 million in 2013 compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The award can shrink or grow depending on whether the firm
            achieves return-on-equity and book-value targets, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The
            long-term incentive was
            $5 million last year and $3 million in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 59, was the highest-paid CEO among peers at the
            largest U.S. banks for a second straight year. Goldman Sachs had
            an 11 percent return on equity in 2013, topping its largest Wall
            Street rivals, as it cut compensation costs amid revenue that
            was little changed. The stock rose 39 percent last year, beating
            the 33 percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Financials
            Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already
            gives a majority of top executives' pay in restricted stock,
            have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term performance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Details of Blankfein's pay were contained in the bank's
            proxy statement for its annual shareholders' meeting, which will
            be held on May 16 in Irving, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's total compensation package of $29 million
            topped the $20 million given to JPMorgan Chase Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, 58, and the $18 million for Morgan
            Stanley CEO James Gorman, 55. Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 54,
            received $14 million and Citigroup Inc.'s Michael Corbat, 53,
            got $14.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Chance to Cut Its China Junk Debt Holdings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says now
            may be a good time to cut holdings of Chinese high-yield bonds
            after the longest winning streak in six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors should use the recent rally to reduce
            overweight positions,' analysts led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a note dated April 4. 'We believe
            that there will
            be more headlines noises to come out of China and expect to see
            further credit differentiation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar-denominated junk bonds from the nation gained 0.95
            percent in the seven days through April 4 for the second
            straight weekly advance, according to Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch indexes. While recent improvement in emerging-market
            sentiment and China's announcement of stimulus last week fueled
            the rally, better-quality issuers remain Goldman's preferred bet
            amid continued concern about the world's second-biggest economy,
            according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China unveiled a package of measures to support the economy
            including railway investment and tax breaks last week, as the
            government seeks to bolster slowing growth. Exports (CNFREXPY) likely rose
            4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the
            median estimate of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before
            trade data this week, after the biggest drop since 2009 in
            February. Manufacturing contracted a third month in March, an
            HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics gauge showed last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sinopec Sells &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group and
            parent of Asia's largest oil refiner, sold $5 billion of bonds
            on April 2, the biggest dollar-denominated sale by an Asian
            issuer in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China Citic
            Bank International Ltd. meets investors from today about a
            possible offering of notes in the U.S. currency, a person
            familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect China issuance to increase and to catch up in
            the remaining quarters, especially given the improvement in
            market sentiment in recent weeks,' wrote Ho. Offerings from the
            nation slumped to $12.7 billion in the first three months of the
            year, from $15.1 billion during the same period last year,
            according to Goldman data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka plans to sell as much as $500 million of notes as
            soon as today, a person familiar with the matter said. The
            sovereign is marketing five-year bonds at about 5.5 percent, the
            person said, asking not to be identified because the terms
            aren't set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pakistan plans to price five- and 10-year dollar-denominated debt as soon as tomorrow, a separate
            person said.
            Bangladesh's Banglalink Digital Communications Ltd. is
            considering a $300 million offering of five-year securities,
            Moody's Investors Service wrote in an e-mailed note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring Asian corporate and sovereign bonds
            from default was little changed today, according to traders of
            credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asia Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
            borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 124 basis points
            as of 8:08 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia New Zealand Banking
            Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is holding at its lowest
            level since April 2, when it touched a six-month low, according
            to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
            quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index slipped 0.5 basis point
            to 97.5 basis points as of 9:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
            Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge is on course for its lowest
            close since April 2, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 83.5
            basis points as of 8:40 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
            bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
            credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
            creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
            the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
            agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

            company, which is owned equally by New York-based private-equity firm Rohatyn Group and another buyout
            investor group that Sozeri, speaking in a phone interview, identified as Spokane while declining to specify
            other details. He also declined to comment on the size of any holding that might be offered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citi
            Venture Capital International, a unit of Citigroup Inc. (C) that was sold to Rohatyn Group last year, and
            Partners in Life Sciences bought Biofarma, a generic producer of heart, respiratory and urinary-tract
            treatments, from its Turkish owners in 2006. A stake was sold to Greek private-equity firm Global Finance in
            2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An attempt to sell the drugmaker in 2011 failed over price, with a person familiar
            with the situation at the time estimating the drugmaker was valued at $600 million to $700 million. A
            spokesman for Rohatyn didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bayer AG,
            GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Novartis AG (NOVN), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) and Amgen Inc. are among more than 30
            international drugmakers operating in Turkey, a medicines market that expanded 6.5 percent to 15.2 billion
            liras ($7.2 billion) in 2013, according to the website of the Istanbul-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers'
            Association of Turkey. Biofarma's revenue in 2010 totaled 160 million liras, according to Istanbul Chamber
            of Industry figures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit is
            joining firms from Ares Capital Corp. (ARCC) to Fifth Street Finance
            Corp. (FSC) in raising about $2 billion to lend to companies unable to
            tap public markets as investors seek to extract high yields. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital LLC, which is
            organized as a so-called business-development company and
            primarily lends to companies earning less than $75 million,
            plans to raise money in an initial public offering, according to
            a March 29 regulatory filing. Last week, New York-based Ares
            Capital, the largest BDC, raised about $290 million by selling
            shares, while Garrison Capital Inc. completed its IPO. Fifth
            Street Finance said it may raise $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The flurry underscores the lengths investors are willing to
            go to in order to generate returns as the Federal Reserve keeps
            benchmark interest rates near zero for a fifth year. While the
            debt the BDCs are buying generate yields of 10 percent or more,
            it doesn't typically trade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Banks have largely abandoned the field in direct lending
            to the mid-market and it's been taken over in the last few years
            by BDCs and private funds,' Nicholas Marshi, the chief
            investment officer at Southland Capital Management, said in a
            telephone interview from Santa Monica, California. Marshi
            manages funds that invest in BDCs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Goldman Lawyer Says Agency Too Timid on Wall Street Misdeeds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A trial attorney from the Securities and Exchange Commission said his bosses were too 'tentative
            and fearful' to bring many Wall Street leaders to heel after the 2008 credit crisis, echoing the regulator's
            outside critics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James Kidney, who joined the SEC in 1986 and retired this month,
            offered the critique in a speech at his goodbye party. His remarks hit home with many in the crowd of SEC
            lawyers and alumni thanks to a part of his resume not publicly known: He had campaigned internally to bring
            charges against more executives in the agency's 2010 case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC has become 'an agency that polices the broken windows on the street level and rarely goes
            to the penthouse floors,' Kidney said, according to a copy of his remarks obtained by Bloomberg News. 'On
            the rare occasions when enforcement does go to the penthouse, good manners are paramount. Tough enforcement,
            risky enforcement, is subject to extensive negotiation and weakening.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kidney said his
            superiors were more focused on getting high-paying jobs after their government service than on bringing
            difficult cases. The agency's penalties, Kidney said, have become 'at most a tollbooth on the bankster
            turnpike.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Loses Bid to End Prudential Fraud Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
            win dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it engaged in fraud and
            racketeering in selling $375 million of residential mortgage-
            backed securities to Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark, New Jersey,
            ruled today that Prudential, the second-largest U.S. life
            insurer, sufficiently pleaded its claims that Goldman
            misrepresented its underwriting standards and practices. Goldman
            will have other opportunities to seek dismissal of the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prudential, based in Newark, bought securities from Goldman
            in 16 deals, according to Wigenton's opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, based in New York, asked the judge to dismiss the
            complaint, arguing that Prudential didn't adequately state its
            case for fraud and racketeering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wigenton disagreed, ruling that Prudential 'adequately
            pled a cause of action for fraud' and sufficiently stated its
            case that Goldman Sachs violated New Jersey's civil anti-
            racketeering statute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchases were made from February 2004 to December
            2008, according to the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parties have not yet engaged in the pretrial exchange
            of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Scot
            Hoffman, a Prudential spokesman, declined to comment on the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also argued that New York law, not New Jersey
            law, applies to the fraud and RICO claims. Wigenton ruled that
            'determining a choice of law at this stage is premature'
            regarding fraud claims. She made a similar ruling with regard to
            the Goldman Sachs motion on the racketeering claim. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Prudential Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs
            Company, 2:12-cv-06590, U.S. District Court, District of New
            Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Dismissal of Capmark's Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) doesn't
            have to face Capmark Financial Group Inc.'s $147 million lawsuit
            claiming it was improperly influenced by the bank to refinance
            $1.5 billion in unsecured debt in a way that improved its
            position as a creditor, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan yesterday
            ruled that Capmark, which sued Goldman in 2011, can't recover
            the money. Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Capmark claimed the sum
            was an insider preference paid to Goldman within a year of the
            Capmark bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sweet said Capmark can't claim the presence of a Goldman
            employee on its board means that the New York-based bank must
            return the $147 million because that argument contradicts its
            earlier position in the bankruptcy case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Plaintiffs represented to the Delaware bankruptcy court
            that the secured credit facility was negotiated at 'arm's
            length,'' Sweet said in a decision made public today.
            'Plaintiffs now assert a claim that requires the secured credit
            facility to have been a non-arms-length transaction.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
            General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September 2011, co-
            owned by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom fought in
            bankruptcy court with Goldman Sachs over the refinancing and the
            payments to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Capmark's Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capmark claimed that while the bank owned part of it in May
            2009, a group of Goldman Sachs units used their influence to
            persuade Capmark to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt
            owed the firm. The refinancing allowed Goldman Sachs to collect
            $147 million, including $7 million in cash, based on the new
            secured loan, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adam Shiff, a lawyer for Capmark, didn't immediately return
            a voice-mail message seeking comment on Sweet's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
            property values and a drop in lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. (CPMK) v. Goldman Sachs
            Credit Partners LP, 11-cv-07511, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Reaches Deal to Drop Proposal for Separate Chairman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reached an
            agreement with an investor for the second straight year to drop
            a proposal from its annual meeting that called for an
            independent board chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank instead will give expanded
            responsibilities to its lead independent director, James Schiro,
            who will set the board's agenda and write his own letter to
            shareholders in the annual proxy statement, New York-based
            Goldman Sachs said. In exchange, shareholder CtW Investment
            Group will withdraw a proposal to split the roles of chief
            executive officer and chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've had a constructive engagement with our
            shareholders, and believe that the enhancements we have made
            further solidify the independence of the board,' David Wells, a
            Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal allows CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, who also has
            been chairman since he took control in 2006, to avoid a battle
            over dual roles that JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon, 57,
            faces. That bank's board urged investors to vote against naming
            a separate chairman at next month's shareholder meeting, saying
            Dimon's dual role remains the 'most effective leadership
            model.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 54, and Wells Fargo
            Co. (WFC)'s John Stumpf, 59, hold both the CEO and chairman titles.
            Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have different people
            in the two roles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Koch, Goldman Agree to Buy Printing-Ink Maker Flint From CVC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Koch Industries Inc. and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s (GS) private-equity unit agreed to buy Flint Group
            from CVC Capital Partners Ltd. to add chemicals and additives
            used in the printing and packaging industries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction, which adds 137 sites, is expected to be
            completed in the second half, the companies said today in a
            statement, without giving financial terms. Flint, based in
            Luxembourg, generates annual sales of about 2.2 billion euros
            ($3 billion). The asset fetched just over 2 billion euros,
            according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined
            to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision by Koch and Goldman Sachs to invest in the
            business coincides with growing demand for packaging and
            increased demand for newspapers in emerging markets. Flint,
            along with DuPont Co. (DD) and MacDermid Group Inc., have been
            gaining ground with flexographic printing plate technology for
            packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Flint is uniquely positioned to capture growth in its
            attractive printed packaging markets while at the same time
            continuing to benefit from strong and resilient performance of
            its print media business,' said Matthias Hieber, head of
            corporate equity investing for German-speaking operations at
            Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division, in the statement.
            'With a significantly improved capital structure, Flint is best
            positioned to pursue its ambitious growth plans.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale marks the end of a years-long attempt by CVC to
            exit Flint which became a market leader in the printing and
            packaging additive industry via acquisitions. CVC shelved an
            initial public offering in 2010 and abandoned another exit
            attempt in 2012 after private-equity firms withdrew from a
            bidding process, people close to the talks said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greenhill Co. advised CVC and Flint in the transaction
            with Koch and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Management &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CVC built the asset from two European ink companies bought
            in 2004 from BASF SE and Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) and merged with Flint Ink
            Corp. in the U.S. a year later to form the enlarged group. The
            private equity company installed new management, appointing Akzo
            Nobel executive Antoine Fady as chief executive in 2011, and
            Steve Dryden as finance head last year from U.K. packaging
            company DS Smith Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Koch, the purchase ties in with its ownership of
            Georgia-Pacific LLC, which brings insight into the needs of
            packaging makers. Koch, led by billionaire brothers Charles and
            David Koch, is one of the largest closely held companies in the
            U.S., with interests ranging from energy to fertilizers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Gives Blankfein $5 Million Long-Term Incentive</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $5 million cash
            bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets, on top of $21 million in 2012 compensation.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The long-term incentive was $3 million last year and $7 million in 2011 when the program
            began, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The awards can shrink or grow depending on whether
            the firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7 percent average increase in book value per
            share. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already gives a portion of top
            executives' pay in restricted stock, have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term
            performance. Goldman Sachs's plan gives the board's compensation committee, led by former Fannie Mae CEO
            James A. Johnson, the power to change the awards to so-called named executive officers, or NEOs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion based on its assessment of an
            individual NEO's performance, adjust the amounts that may be paid under this award,' according to the
            filing, which says the committee can give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            firm also granted President Gary D. Cohn a $5 million long-term award this year. Vice Chairmen J. Michael
            Evans and John S. Weinberg got $4 million incentives. Last year, all of the firm's executives named in the
            proxy received $3 million in long-term incentives, down from $7 million for all of the executives in 2011.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Viniar's Exception &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially
            tied to three-year periods, the board can opt to extend the measurement for another five years. In December,
            the compensation committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay to end in December 2018
            instead of December 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One exception is for David A. Viniar, who retired as chief
            financial officer at the end of January. He will receive any 2011 incentive pay in January 2014 and any 2012
            long-term grant in January 2015, according to today's proxy filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The board's ability
            to change the long-term incentive measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any individual it
            singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an
            executive a better chance at getting the money,' said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of
            Michigan's law school and business school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's top executives also received
            payouts from funds managed by the firm during the year, including profits, return of money invested, and
            their portion of the funds' management fees, known as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2
            million for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar, $21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6
            million for Weinberg, according to the proxy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other recipients of such fund
            distributions included Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel Gregory K.
            Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy showed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Leads $25 Million Financing in Startup Motif</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Motif Investing Inc., a Web-based
            startup that lets investors buy baskets of stocks based on
            themes like home improvement and Obamacare, raised $25 million
            in a financing round led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Darren Cohen, who leads Goldman's principal strategic
            investments group, is joining Motif's board as an observer, the
            San Mateo, California-based company said today in a statement.
            Existing investors Foundation Capital, Ignition Partners and
            Norwest Venture Partners contributed to the round. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2010, Motif is among an increasing number of
            startups offering online products for investors that are
            designed to lower the cost of trading while avoiding high-
            priced, poor-performing mutual funds. Jemstep Inc. and
            FutureAdvisor provide asset-allocation advice and help clients
            easily make the recommended trades, while Wealthfront Inc.
            manages money online by investing in low-fee index funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This space is heating up,' Hardeep Walia, 40, Motif's
            chief executive officer, said in an interview. 'If you think
            about what we've done in Silicon Valley, we've disrupted so many
            businesses, but no one's traditionally had luck in financial
            services.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motif offers custom-made and user-generated funds of up to
            30 stocks for about $10. To date, the company has focused on
            providing retail investors an alternative to exchange-traded
            funds sold by companies like E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) and Charles
            Schwab Corp. (SCHW) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investment Savings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the additional financing, Motif is rolling out the
            software to investment advisors, giving them products to offer
            clients without management fees attached. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For example, brokers could sell a fund created by Motif,
            use one created by someone else that's available on the site or
            establish their own by copying what's in a particular mutual
            fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That allows them to save the 2 to 3 percent fees they're
            paying every year to mutual-fund companies,' Walia said. 'They
            can either take that as a reward for their business or pass the
            savings along to customers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motif has 40 employees, including several early executives
            from E*Trade. The company has patent-pending technology that
            lowers the cost of volume trading, letting it make 'good
            margins' at $10 a trade, Walia said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Obamacare, Housing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Obamacare motif includes shares of hospitals like HCA
            Holdings Inc. (HCA), electronic medical-records providers such as
            Cerner Corp. (CERN) and generic-drug maker Actavis Inc. (ACT) The fund is
            designed for investors looking to benefit from the Affordable
            Care Act, which may extend coverage to 30 million previously
            uninsured Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's also a motif called Ivy League that follows the
            investment strategy of David Swensen, chief investment officer
            at Yale University. Other motifs focus on biotechnology
            breakthroughs, the natural-gas glut and the housing recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs group leading the investment is part of
            the bank's securities division and backs financial-technology
            startups and market structure-related companies. Previous
            investments include the London Metal Exchange and Broadway
            Technology LLC, a provider of electronic-trading systems. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In today's release, Cohen of Goldman Sachs said Motif 'has
            taken an innovative approach to traditional investing.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Pays Cohn More Than Evans in First Gap Since 2007</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein's top deputies
            are no longer equal in terms of pay at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
            compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, according to
            the New York-
            based firm's annual proxy filing. The disparity is the first
            since 2007, when Blankfein's bonus set the record for a Wall
            Street chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The change may further fuel speculation about which
            executive is most likely to succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes
            out-earned his own boss Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded
            Paulson as Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO in June 2006, said in
            a February interview with Bloomberg Television that he has plans
            to stay in the top job indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If somebody gets more money that could be a sign' that
            they're in the running for the job eventually, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global
            Executive Search
            in New York. 'A partnership is very big about 'what message are
            we giving each partner?'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees Goldman Sachs's
            emerging-markets business, received $17 million, as did
            Weinberg, 56, who helps oversee investment banking. David Viniar, who retired as the firm's chief financial
            officer
            earlier this year, was awarded $19 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn's package for 2012 included a $5.15 million cash
            bonus. Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55 million cash award. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Performance, Roles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
            NEOs, were 'primarily to reflect their individual performance,
            as well as their roles,' the bank said in the filing. 'No
            specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
            in making these NEO compensation determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein received a larger bonus than his deputies for the
            first time since 2007, when he set a Wall Street pay record. All
            of Goldman Sachs's named executives received no bonus in 2008,
            and then got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million
            and $10 million over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein got $21 million for last year, his highest annual
            package since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January.
            That consisted of $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7
            million cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million
            salary, according to today's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
            largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
            Stanley (MS)'s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Overcoming Opposition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
            reported its first revenue gain in three years in 2012, as each
            of its four divisions showed an increase last year. The bank's
            return on equity was 10.7 percent, up from 3.7 percent in 2011
            while less than one-third of what the firm earned in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
            increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
            16 percent this year, they're still 12 percent below their level
            at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's compensation committee has been led by
            James A. Johnson, a former CEO of Fannie Mae, as long as the
            bank has been a public company. Johnson was re-elected to the
            board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year's
            shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
            Ruane, Cunniff Goldfarb Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut 900 jobs last year, and compensation
            costs rose 6 percent, trailing the 19 percent increase in
            revenue. In November, the firm named 70 employees to its so-
            called partnership, the fewest in 13 years as a public company,
            and said last month that it will start naming managing directors
            every two years instead of annually. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Cohn Takes Pay Lead Among CEO's Deputies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
            fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has started differentiating
            among Lloyd C. Blankfein's top deputies again after four years
            of granting lockstep pay awards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
            compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, the New
            York-based firm said
            in an annual proxy. The disparity is the first since 2007, when
            Blankfein's bonus set the record for a Wall Street chief
            executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn's pay may fuel speculation about which executive will
            succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes out-earned his own boss
            Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded Paulson as chairman and
            CEO in June 2006, said in a February interview with Bloomberg
            Television that he has no immediate plans to depart. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If somebody gets more money, that could be a sign' that
            they're in the lead to succeed Blankfein, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global
            Executive Search
            in New York. 'If somebody gets less money it's not a good
            thing, because they've been equals.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees the emerging-
            markets business, received $17 million, as did Weinberg, 56, a
            co-head of investment banking. David A. Viniar, chief financial
            officer until the end of January, was awarded $19 million. The
            firm didn't disclose 2012 pay for Harvey M. Schwartz, who
            replaced Viniar as CFO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Individual Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
            NEOs, were 'primarily to reflect their individual performance,
            as well as their roles,' the bank said in the filing. 'No
            specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
            in making these NEO compensation determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, also received a larger bonus than his
            deputies for the first time since 2007. None of Goldman Sachs's
            named executives was awarded a bonus for 2008, and each of them
            got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million and $10
            million over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's $21 million award for 2012 was his highest
            since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January. It
            included $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7 million
            cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million salary,
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
            largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
            Stanley (MS)'s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cash Bonuses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn's and Viniar's packages for 2012 each included a $5.15
            million cash bonus, while Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55
            million cash award. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pay is higher for all executives if long-term incentive
            plan awards are included. The plan will pay $5 million in cash
            bonuses to Blankfein and Cohn, and $4 million to Evans and
            Weinberg in three years if the firm meets certain targets. The
            same rules apply to last year's $3 million long-term incentive
            and $7 million in 2011, when the plan started. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cash bonuses shrink or grow depending on whether the
            firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7
            percent average increase in book value per share. The board's
            compensation committee, which has been led by former Fannie Mae
            CEO James A. Johnson as long as Goldman Sachs has been a public
            company, has the power to change the awards. The committee can
            give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially tied to three-
            year periods, the board can also opt to extend the measurement
            for a further five years. In December, the compensation
            committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay
            to end in December 2018 instead of December 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Getting Money &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The board's ability to change the long-term incentive
            measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any
            individual it singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can
            be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an
            executive a better chance at getting the money,' said Erik
            Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school
            and business school. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top executives received payouts from funds managed by the
            firm during the year, including profits, return of money
            invested, and their portion of the funds' management fees, known
            as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2 million
            for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar,
            $21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6 million for Weinberg,
            according to the proxy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other recipients of such fund distributions included Vice
            Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel
            Gregory K. Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy
            showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Results Improve &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported its first revenue gain in three
            years in 2012. Return on equity, a measure of how well the bank
            reinvests shareholders' money, rose to 10.7 percent from 3.7
            percent in 2011. Still, it remained at less than one-third of
            its 2007 level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
            increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
            17 percent this year to close yesterday at $149.12, they're
            still 11 percent below their level at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Johnson, head of the compensation committee, was re-elected
            to the board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year's
            shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
            Ruane, Cunniff Goldfarb Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's board altered succession planning for top
            executives, which it used for Schwartz's ascension to CFO, lead
            director James Schiro wrote in his inaugural letter to
            shareholders. The new framework is focused on making sure
            potential candidates have experience with the board and with
            many of the firm's businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our goal is always to be in a position to appoint our
            most senior executives from within our firm,' the board said in
            the annual proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Client Trade Lawsuits Over Singapore Stock Rout</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Lynne Ng Su Ling, an independent director at LionGold Corp.,
            traded
            lawsuits in London over payment demands after shares owned by Ng
            and held by the bank as debt collateral plunged in an October
            stock rout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs units are seeking $17.5 million from Ng,
            money the bank says she owes after it sold her shares, according
            to a countersuit by the bank filed March 24 and made available
            over the weekend. In a complaint served on Goldman Sachs in
            February, Ng says the bank failed to use reasonable efforts to
            get the best price available when it sold her stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ng's portfolio with Goldman Sachs totaled S$113 million
            ($90 million) including shares in Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP), Blumont
            Group Ltd. (BLUM) and LionGold, as of Sept. 30, according to court
            papers. She is the third client Goldman has sued over unpaid
            debts related to a stock crash over three days in October that
            wiped $6.9 billion off the market value of LionGold, Blumont
            Group Ltd. and Asiasons Capital Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sudden declines prompted the city's central bank and
            white-collar crime agency to probe suspected stock-trading
            irregularities around the tumble. Banks and brokers are seeking
            to recover at least $230 million from the stock rout. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blackstone, Goldman Said to Buy Ipreo From KKR for $975M</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world's
            biggest private-equity firm, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
            merchant banking unit agreed to buy financial data provider
            Ipreo Holdings LLC from KKR Co. (KKR) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction values New York-based Ipreo at $975
            million, according to a person with knowledge of the deal, who
            requested anonymity because financial terms weren't announced.
            KKR will keep a minority stake in the company, according to a
            statement today from the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Together with KKR, we have grown significantly and
            solidified our leadership in capital markets software, and data
            and analytics services,' Scott Ganeles, Ipreo's chief executive
            officer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR, the private-equity firm led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, bought Ipreo in 2011 from
            investment firm Veronis
            Suhler Stevenson LLC. Kristi Huller, a KKR spokeswoman, declined
            to comment on the company's value. Christine Anderson, a
            spokeswoman for Blackstone, didn't immediately respond to a
            request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP competes with Ipreo in providing initial
            public offering data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Profits as Abe Spurs Convertible Debt Boom: Japan Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) helped
            regional Japanese banks sell the most dollar-denominated
            convertible debt since at least 1999, as the lenders took
            advantage of a stock-market rally to fund overseas expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest underwriter of the notes helped to
            arrange three of the firms' five U.S. currency sales in the last
            12 months. It co-managed deals by Yamagata Bank Ltd., Bank of
            Iwate Ltd. and Shizuoka Bank Ltd., whose convertible offering
            last April was the first by a Japanese company since 2002,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman had only
            underwritten seven Japanese convertible-note sales in the decade
            prior to 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Convertible bonds have established themselves as one
            funding tool, so all regional lenders have no choice but to
            consider them to some extent,' Hiroyuki Sugiura, a vice
            president at Goldman's investment banking division at the
            company's Japanese unit in Tokyo said in an April 11 interview.
            They offer the regional lenders cheaper funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abe's stimulus program to overcome 15 years of deflation
            has spurred a stock market recovery that has allowed banks to
            get favorable terms on their convertibles, with the three
            lenders all selling zero-coupon notes. The regional institutions
            will use the funds to lend to clients expanding overseas as a
            shrinking domestic population curtails growth prospects at home. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Quickest Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs underwrote $330 million of the $1.3 billion
            of dollar convertible bonds sold by regional banks over the past
            12 months, a figure exceeded only by Nomura Holdings Inc. Morgan
            Stanley, the next biggest overseas manager, managed $120
            million, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Nomura, Japan's largest
            brokerage, arranged $585 million in debt, including an issuance
            by Yamaguchi Financial Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman was the quickest in bringing us a proposal,'
            Katsunori Nakanishi, the president of Shizuoka Bank, said
            yesterday in an interview. 'After looking at the success of our
            deal, it became easier for other regional banks to follow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of convertible notes, which combine a fixed-income
            security with an option to buy stock, have surged since Abe's
            stimulus program sparked a 51.5 percent gain in the Topix
            benchmark index last year. While the index is down 13 percent
            since the start of this year, it's still higher than at any
            point from 2009 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for Japanese convertibles has been 10 to 15 times
            more than the amount of notes on offer since the beginning of
            2014, Takashi Masuda, head of equity linked products at Goldman
            in Tokyo, said in the same interview. Outstanding issuances have
            fallen to about 1.5 trillion yen ($14.8 billion) from about 10
            trillion yen in 2000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bond Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese exchangeable-note returns fell 3.9 percent this
            year, following a 35 percent gain in 2013 which was their best
            performance since 1999, data from UBS AG show. While the bonds
            have insulated investors somewhat from stock-market declines,
            they're underperforming the 2.4 percent gain in convertible debt
            globally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All Japanese companies including Joyo Bank Ltd. sold $900
            million in dollar convertibles so far this year, compared with
            $1 billion for all of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are more than 100 companies in Yamagata with
            overseas operations and we will use the money to help meet their
            funding needs,' said Nobuhiro Konno, the manager of the general
            planning and coordination division at Yamagata Bank, based in
            northern Japan. 'Since the sale of dollar convertibles by
            Shizuoka, Iwate and Yamaguchi Financial, a lot of brokerages
            came to explain the product, and that was the catalyst for our
            sale.' The bank sold $100 million of five-year convertible
            debentures this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Yen Convertibles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other regional banks including Nagano Bank Ltd. and Daisan
            Bank Ltd. have issued yen-denominated convertibles this year,
            with financial institutions accounting for the biggest amount of
            sales by sector after industrials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shizuoka Bank's dollar notes due 2018 can be exchanged for
            shares at $13.46, or 18 percent above the closing stock price on
            April 9 in dollar terms. The stock was at the equivalent of
            $9.38 yesterday. Shares in Yamagata Bank closed at $4.01 April
            14, compared with a conversion price of $5.09 on its 2019 debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's cheap dollars, and all the larger regional banks are
            trying to increase their U.S. dollar lending as their clients
            increasingly venture overseas,' Graeme Knowd, an associate
            managing director who overseas financial institutions at Moody's
            Investors Service in Tokyo said in a phone interview. 'Given
            they lend to Japanese corporates, they probably need to fund as
            cheaply as possible.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Abe Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abe came to power in December 2012 calling for fiscal
            spending, deregulation and Bank of Japan monetary easing to
            raise the inflation rate to 2 percent. BOJ stimulus has helped
            weaken the yen more than 14 percent against the dollar since the
            end of 2012, bolstering the overseas earnings of Japanese
            companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen traded at 101.61 per dollar as of 5:22 p.m. in
            Tokyo yesterday, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield was at
            0.605 percent, the world's lowest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Non-yen-denominated lending by Shizuoka Bank rose 91
            percent to the equivalent of 414.4 billion yen at the end of
            last year, compared with a 5.5 percent increase in total loans
            to 6.98 trillion yen. The bank said yesterday it will seek to
            boost lending at overseas branches to $3 billion by March 2019
            from an estimated $1.72 billion for the fiscal year just ended
            as part of a medium-term plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Underwriter &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been the biggest manager of global
            convertible bonds for the last three years, underwriting about
            $14 billion in 2013 including notes sold by Yahoo Inc., Tesla
            Motors Inc. and Air France-KLM, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank hasn't underwritten any yen-denominated convertible bonds since it helped
            manage Sony
            Corp.'s 150 billion yen issue in November 2012. Prior to that
            Goldman helped manage one convertible bond deal each in 2009,
            2008 and 2007, by Japanese issuers, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Convertible sales this year may exceed last year, said
            Goldman's Masuda, adding the bank is looking to underwrite both
            yen and dollar-denominated deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If issuance continues to climb, we're confident of taking
            market share,' Masuda said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gross Loses to Goldman in Hot Bond Strategy as Pimco Lags</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Gross just can't catch a
            break. As investors flock to funds designed to make money even
            if interest rates increase, Gross's Pacific Investment
            Management Co. is alone among the biggest bond managers in
            suffering withdrawals from the strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a category that's been the most popular choice for
            fixed-income investors this year, the Pimco Unconstrained Bond
            Fund (PUBAX) has lost $2.7 billion to redemptions. Similar offerings
            from Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Co. and
            BlackRock Inc. have seen a surge of deposits from investors
            seeking to avoid potential bond-market losses. The Pimco fund
            has trailed a majority of peers over the past three and five
            years, and has lagged behind most rivals over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pimco has kind of shot themselves in the foot here,'
            said Steve Roge, a money manager with Bohemia, New York-based
            R.W. Roge Co., where he helps oversee $225 million. 'In a new
            category where there are other choices, why is someone going to
            look at a fund that has been a bottom performer?,' said Roge,
            who owns several Pimco funds but has no money in Pimco
            Unconstrained. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The redemptions from the fund are particularly painful for
            Pimco because bond managers are counting on the flexible
            strategy to attract money as investors flee traditional funds in
            anticipation of the end of a bull market in bonds. Gross's Pimco
            Total Return Fund (PTTRX) suffered record redemptions last year after
            the 70-year-old manager misjudged the impact of the Federal
            Reserve's move to scale back its bond-buying program -- a
            mistake echoed by the Unconstrained fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Non-traditional funds attracted $12.6 billion in the first
            three months of 2014, with offerings from Goldman Sachs,
            JPMorgan and BlackRock collecting a combined $10.7 billion
            through March, according to data from Chicago-based Morningstar
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, $24.3 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund was
            Pimco's best-selling mutual fund as investors added $8.7
            billion. Industrywide, unconstrained or flexible funds as a
            group collected $55 billion last year. Intermediate funds, the
            biggest category of bond funds, which includes Pimco Total
            Return, saw withdrawals of $79 billion, Morningstar data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The redemptions over the past year mark a new phase for
            Pimco, which has more than doubled assets since 2008 as
            investors fled to the perceived safety of bonds following the
            financial crisis. As that rally has come to an end, Gross and
            the Newport Beach, California-based company he co-founded in
            1971 have faced their share of challenges this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;El-Erian Departure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In January, Gross's heir apparent, Mohamed El-Erian,
            unexpectedly announced his resignation as chief executive
            officer and co-chief investment officer. His departure was
            followed by reports of tension between the two. Gross lashed out
            at El-Erian in a June meeting as performance stumbled and
            withdrawals continued, two people familiar with the matter said
            this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Total Return suffered record redemptions of $41.1
            billion last year and lost its title as the world's biggest
            mutual fund. Clients pulled an estimated net $3.1 billion from
            the fund and $7.3 billion from all of Pimco's U.S. mutual funds
            in March, according to Morningstar. Pimco's assets under
            management declined to $1.94 trillion as of March. 31, from a
            peak of $2.04 trillion last March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained's former manager, Chris Dialynas, said
            in December that he was going to take a sabbatical. Gross took
            over the management of the fund, highlighting the importance of
            the strategy to the firm. Dialynas, who joined Pimco in 1980,
            had run the fund since it was created in June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gross Overhauls &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Gross took over management, he made changes including
            extending the effective duration, or sensitivity to interest
            rates, as well as jettisoning 30-year Treasuries (USGG30YR) and most of the
            agency mortgage bonds. The duration of the fund more than
            doubled to 4.1 years in December before falling back to 2.1
            years as of March 31, Pimco's website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orange County Employees Retirement System voted Jan. 29 to
            put the Unconstrained strategy on a watch list for change in key
            personnel after investment consultant NEPC LLC said it had
            'elevated' concerns following the management change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flexible funds can buy anything in the fixed-income realm,
            from emerging market debt to credit default swaps, and they also
            have the ability to bet against rates, which means they make
            money if rates climb. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Wide Net' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We can cast a wide net, long or short,' said William
            Eigen, manager of the $26.3 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income
            Opportunities Fund, (JSOAX) which passed Pimco Unconstrained in March to
            become the biggest of what are considered non-traditional bond
            funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Unconstrained Bond fund has the flexibility to
            navigate across the fixed-income spectrum, it wasn't able to
            avoid losses last year because, along with other Pimco funds, it
            is guided by the firm's world view on everything from the global
            economy to interest rates. Gross, in a December interview posted
            on Pimco's website, said a model portfolio established by the
            firm's investment committee is the driving force behind the
            positioning of its funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Unconstrained Bond fund was hurt last year by holding
            intermediate and long-dated bonds when former Fed Chairman Ben
            S. Bernanke in May hinted that the central bank might scale back
            its bond-buying program. The subsequent increase in interest
            rates caused those bonds to lose value. The fund also suffered
            losses in its holdings of emerging-market debt, according to a
            December regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trailing Peers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained fell 2.6 percent last year, lagging
            behind 84 percent of peers, Morningstar data show. The fund's
            assets have declined 16 percent since July 31, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained has had 'unexciting,' results, Eric Jacobson, an analyst for Morningstar, wrote
            in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's also possible that the recent drama at Pimco is
            having some effect,' said Jacobson, referring to the departure
            of El-Erian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sabrina Callin, the product manager for Pimco's
            Unconstrained Bond strategy, which has $46 billion in assets,
            said it is not a surprise that some rival funds have done
            better. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shunning Credit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Many of the funds in this universe are very credit-oriented, especially high-yield credit,' said
            Callin in a
            telephone interview. 'People who have had that risk exposure
            have done well.' Credit generally refers to corporate debt,
            which is sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained has never been focused on corporate
            credit or other risk assets, she said. It is designed instead to
            preserve capital and limit losses in falling markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. high-yield bonds returned 7.4 percent in 2013,
            according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The Pimco
            fund had 2 percent of its money in junk bonds as of Dec. 31 and
            had a bet against the bonds as of Sept. 30, according to data on
            Pimco's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Eigen said his fund had more than 40 percent of
            its money in high-yield bonds at the beginning of 2013. He cut
            that allocation to 25 percent as of Feb. 28, according to the
            fund's website, as the bonds rallied. JPMorgan Strategic Income
            Opportunities Fund climbed 2.8 percent in 2013, ahead of 74
            percent of rivals, according to Morningstar data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Beats &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $20.7 billion Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX),
            which gained 6.1 percent last year to beat 97 percent of peers,
            was generally bullish on corporate bonds in 2013 on the
            assumption the debt would do well in an improving economy,
            Jonathan Beinner, manager of the fund said in a telephone
            interview. The fund had 5.1 percent of its money in high-yield
            bonds as of Dec. 31, data from Goldman's website show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $14.8 billion BlackRock (BLK) Strategic Income Opportunities
            Portfolio, which rose 3 percent last year, had a 21 percent
            allocation to bonds rated BB or lower, below investment grade,
            as of Dec. 31, a blend of high-yield bonds, bank loans and
            emerging-market debt, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pimco fund has also had a different take than rivals on
            the maturities of bonds it prefers. Last year, the fund held
            intermediate and long-term bonds. This year, according to
            Pimco's website, the fund has invested at the front-end of the
            yield curve, usually defined as bonds with maturities of 1-5
            years, and has bet against longer-dated bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2014, the fund has advanced 1.3 percent, with the
            second-best returns of the four biggest flexible funds, trailing
            only the BlackRock fund. In March, shorter-term bonds fell as
            the Federal Reserve suggested it could begin raising interest
            rates in 2015. The bonds have rallied in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rieder's Approach &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rick Rieder, manager of BlackRock Strategic Income, took
            the exact opposite approach to Pimco's. He avoided longer-term
            debt in 2013, which helped his performance, he said in a
            telephone interview. He bought those bonds this year, another
            plus, and bet against bonds with between 3 years and 7 years of
            maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are not a lot of cheap assets out there so you have
            to be nimble,' said Rieder. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman and JPMorgan funds are both wagering that rates
            in general will climb this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are believers in an economic rebound, and you have to
            think rates will normalize as is the economy does,' said Eigen.
            Goldman expects rates to rise in the U.S., and the United
            Kingdom, said Beinner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Low Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross has argued the Fed will be in no rush to raise rates
            because inflation remains well below the central bank's target
            of 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Pimco, Callin said the goal of the Unconstrained Bond
            fund is to produce good risk-adjusted results over the long
            haul. In the past three years, the fund's risk-adjusted results
            were the lowest among the four funds, according to the Bloomberg
            Riskless Return Ranking. The BlackRock fund ranked first,
            followed by the Goldman fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pimco may not get every call right every day or every
            year,' said Callin. 'But we have a good long-term record of
            getting things right for investors.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Closes Brent GSCI Recommendation After 16% Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            was ending a recommendation to hold a long position in the SP
            GSCI Brent Total Return Index amid disappointing oil demand and
            refinery maintenance in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holding the position, first recommended in August, would
            have resulted in a 16 percent loss, the bank said in an e-mailed
            report today. Weakness in European demand for refined fuels and
            a slowdown in China, are weighing on prices even as global
            inventory levels remain tight, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the tug of war between tight global oil fundamentals
            and the negative sentiment created by weak European product
            markets and fears of further Chinese slowdown, the latter
            currently prevail,' Jeff Currie, head of commodities research
            in New York, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro-zone economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013 as it
            struggles to move past its debt crisis, the European Commission
            predicted on Feb. 22. Economic expansion unexpectedly eased in
            China, the world's largest energy consumer, according to data
            for the first quarter from the Beijing-based National Bureau of
            Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent slumped as much as 2.6 percent today to a nine-month
            low of $100.41 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'European margins could suffer further as the European
            refinery turnaround season has peaked and more and more
            refineries are coming back from maintenance,' Currie said.
            'This could put further downward pressure on Brent prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' advice to take a long position in the Brent
            index on Aug. 21 was a modification of earlier recommendation to
            buy West Texas Intermediate crude contracts. That suggestion
            would have resulted in a 10.8 percent loss. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Shares Fall as Trading Revenue Misses Estimates</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall Street bank that generates the highest percentage of
            revenue from trading, dropped as much as 3 percent after revenue from that business fell more than its
            rivals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares slumped 1.6 percent to $144.10 in New York at 4:15 p.m., the
            second-largest decline in the 81-company Standard Poor's 500 Financials Index (S5FINL). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs's first-quarter revenue from trading stocks and fixed-income products fell 12 percent to $5.22
            billion, excluding accounting charges. That missed some analysts' estimates, including $5.48 billion from
            Oppenheimer Co.'s Chris Kotowski and $5.25 billion from Credit Suisse Group AG's Howard Chen. The revenue
            decline at New York-based Goldman Sachs was bigger than at Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman's trading expertise has less value right now because they can't deploy it as they used
            to,' Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. who rates the stock outperform, told Erik Schatzker
            on Bloomberg Television. 'Trading is going to have a difficult time taking off from this point.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currency- and commodity-trading revenue was $3.26 billion, down 9 percent from a year
            earlier, excluding the accounting charge related to the firm's own debt. Revenue from the equities division,
            overseen by co-Chief Operating Officers R. Martin Chavez, Michael D. Daffey and Paul M. Russo, declined 17
            percent from a year earlier to $1.96 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Traders Cede Tokyo Party Bar to Google-Apple Invasion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The champagne used to flow at Heartland, the bar in Tokyo's Roppongi Hills complex that drew
            bankers from the Japan headquarters of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
            upstairs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Every day, there was a party,' said Mai Shioya, the 39- year-old manager, who
            started in May 2008 before the global financial crisis that led to Lehman's bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bankers
            in well-cut suits would come in about 5 p.m., hand bartenders corporate credit cards and let their friends
            charge drinks to the tab until 2 a.m., said Michio Nakamura, 45, who's been running events and entertainment
            at Heartland since its opening as part of the famed Roppongi Hills development in 2003. After the financial
            crisis, many disappeared, cutting revenue by 30 percent, Shioya said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Those customers
            and that age have gone,' she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The void is being filled by a new group of bar
            patrons: information-technology workers. While financial firms have cut staff in Japan, technology companies
            have boosted hiring, and as bankers vacated offices at Roppongi Hills, companies including Google Inc.
            (GOOG) and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) moved in. As early as this month, Apple Inc. (AAPL) will also make the
            complex its home in Japan, two people familiar with the plan said in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Hiring
            demand for IT workers is very high,' said Taizo Hattori, a director for information technology at Career
            Incubation Inc., a Tokyo-based recruiting and consulting company. 'Many IT firms have doubled headcounts.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vacating Floors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, one of the original tenants which
            has been reducing headcount and moving jobs elsewhere in Asia, is in talks with its landlord to vacate two
            of the six floors it occupies in the 54-story Mori Tower, part of the $2.2 billion Roppongi Hills complex
            developed by Mori Building Co. (MBDZ), two people with knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lehman's
            Asian business was bought by Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., and its Japan operations were transferred to
            the Otemachi business district in 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. and European banks have been eliminating
            jobs and transferring staff from Japan to Hong Kong and Singapore to reduce expenses. Goldman Sachs led
            foreign banks in accelerating job cuts at their Japanese brokerages, according to filings with Japan's
            Financial Services Agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Japanese brokerage unit had 847 employees as
            of March 31, 2012, down about 30 percent from 1,205 in March 2008, the filings show. Barclays Plc (BARC),
            whose Japan headquarters is also at Roppongi Hills, was another that reduced brokerage staff, according to
            the filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Visible Changes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes are visible at Heartland,
            located at the street level of the landmark Mori Tower, said Shioya, the manager. Originally opened to
            promote Heartland brand beer, brewed by Tokyo-based Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), it's one of several bars and
            restaurants in Roppongi Hills, which also includes upscale shops, a hotel, apartments, a movie theater and
            an art museum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People used to be drinking more,' she said. 'Some customers opened seven
            bottles of champagne for their birthdays. Some would ask us to prepare 100 champagne glasses for
            celebrations, and they were offering them to bar staff and strangers.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With fewer
            bankers and more patrons from the tech world, the atmosphere has become more laid back, Shioya said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After business declined following the financial crisis, the bar began showing sporting events on
            its big-screen display to draw customers. Couches where well-dressed men and mini-skirted women once paired
            up to lounge and drink cocktails were replaced with tables and stools. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Clientele Change
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The bankers were often drinking with ladies who came here to meet foreign businessmen,
            who were looking to marry a wealthy banker and go overseas,' Shioya said, adding that now the women who come
            tend to be office workers looking to practice English. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a recent Friday evening, male
            patrons in jeans or cargo pants, unshaven, wearing baseball caps or carrying backpacks were as numerous as
            men in suits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's changed a lot, especially the clientele,' said Felix Beatty, an
            information-risk-management specialist from Montreal who was celebrating his 36th birthday by drinking
            Heartland beer instead of champagne. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As their hangout transformed, some of the remaining
            bankers abandoned it for Rigoletto, a bar and restaurant on the fifth floor, said Beatty, who's been coming
            to Heartland since 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April 2009, after overseas financial companies cut about
            4,300 jobs, or 16 percent of their Japan workforce in 15 months, Heartland hosted a 'pink-slip party' to
            help unemployed bankers network and find new jobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Google Expansion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially
            occupying 1 1/2 floors at Mori Tower, Google's offices now take up the 26th, 28th and 30th floors, as well
            as most of the 27th. The Mountain View, California-based company declined in an e-mail to disclose its
            number of employees in the building. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo (992), the world's second-largest maker of
            personal computers, moved its Japan headquarters to Roppongi Hills in April 2010. Google, operator of the
            world's biggest search engine, relocated from Tokyo's Shibuya district in August the same year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other information-technology companies in Mori Tower include Baidu Inc. (BIDU), operator of China's
            most-popular search engine; Gree Inc. (3632), a Japanese social-networking game site operator; and San
            Francisco-based Salesforce.com, the biggest maker of online customer-management software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Roppongi
            Hills is sort of a tech hub,' said Joseph Schmidt, a spokesman for Salesforce.com. The site's central
            location and gas-operated power generators to keep offices working during earthquake-related power cuts make
            it 'second to none' for business-continuity planning, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Valuable Proximity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Baidu, proximity to other information-technology companies is valuable, said Kaiser Kuo, a
            spokesman for the Beijing-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo, which started out with one floor at
            Mori Tower, has since expanded to a second, said Angela Lee, a spokeswoman for the Beijing-based company,
            which now has about 300 employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Having our main office in Roppongi Hills has brought
            a positive impact on employees' motivation and recruiting,' Lee said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple, based in
            Cupertino, California, will move to Roppongi Hills from Tokyo's Shinjuku district as early as this month and
            will occupy one or two floors, the people familiar with the plan said. Apple didn't respond to requests for
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'IT firms are attracted because of the business environment,' Tomohiro Akita, a
            spokesman for Mori Building, said of Mori Tower, citing the in-house power generators, hotel and conference
            space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hiring Jump &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hiring at information-technology and
            communications companies through three of Japan's biggest recruiting agencies jumped 23 percent from a year
            earlier to 3,093 people in the six months ended Sept. 30, the Japan Executive Search and Recruitment
            Association said in a report in November. Financial- services hiring rose 7.5 percent to 830, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for information-technology staff is outpacing supply and has been accelerating since early
            this year, Career Incubation's Hattori said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Internet-service companies that target
            consumers are making money and are cash-rich,' he said. 'They can afford to invest in human resources and
            are especially interested in people who can develop business overseas.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rents for prime
            office space in Tokyo have fallen more than 40 percent from a peak in the first quarter of 2008, according
            to property broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., prompting more companies to relocate as they seek to upgrade
            office space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Falling Rent &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rental value in the Akasaka and
            Roppongi areas in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 57 percent of the 2008 peak, according to Jones Lang.
            That's attracted new tenants, cutting the vacancy rate in the area to 2.7 percent as of September from 3.3
            percent the preceding quarter, data from Jones Lang show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Geeks have increased around
            the area,' said Hattori of Career Incubation. 'Even some manager-level people who earn a lot of money wear
            jeans and athletic shoes. Probably they don't have to care about their clothes as they are just happy as
            long as they can produce something interesting.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technology companies have also
            transformed the commercial real-estate market in New York, helping offset sluggish demand from
            financial-services firms. Lower Manhattan office vacancies fell in the first quarter to the lowest since
            2008 as technology and creative firms moved in, Cushman Wakefield said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            chances of a resurgence in financial-firm hiring in Tokyo aren't great, said Tetsuya Sakabe, managing
            director at Kanae Associates Ltd., an executive-search firm specializing in the industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's
            no strong demand for bankers in the mergers-and- acquisitions field,' he said. 'And not for debt and equity
            capital markets, either.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;India is close to appointing
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to manage an exchange-traded fund that
            will include companies part-owned by the government, said three
            people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The selection of New York-based Goldman's asset management
            unit is awaiting approval from Indian Finance Minister
            Palaniappan Chidambaram, said one of the people, who asked not
            to be identified as the process is private. It will then go to
            the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, this person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An aide to President Pranab Mukherjee said in September
            that India was working on an exchange-traded fund that tracks
            state-owned companies, as the government seeks to attract money
            to its stock market. Officials haven't decided which stocks will
            be included in the fund, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;D.S. Malik, a spokesman for India's finance ministry, and
            Edward Naylor, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Pay Pool Shrinks 1% in First Quarter After Job Cuts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
            $4.34 billion to pay employees in the first quarter, about 1
            percent less than a year earlier, as the firm employed 400 fewer
            people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The compensation expense was equal 43 percent of revenue,
            down from 44 percent in the first quarter of 2012, the New York-
            based company said today in a statement. The sum, which covers
            salaries, benefits and accruals for year-end bonuses, is enough
            to give each of the bank's 32,000 employees $135,594 for the
            first three months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
            biggest U.S. bank by assets, are cutting costs and jobs to
            improve shareholder returns. The company, led by Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has trimmed compensation
            expenses by more than a third in the five years through 2012,
            while revenue fell 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock climbed 41 percent last year, showing that
            shareholders were 'relatively happy' with the firm's
            compensation decisions in 2012, President Gary Cohn said in a
            Bloomberg Television interview in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You'll never get it perfect, but I think we got it
            right,' said Cohn, 52. 'Relative to the competitive landscape
            that we operate in, our people got paid relatively fairly,
            relative to the contribution they made to the firm and to our
            share price.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Gets U.K. Approval to Operate Bank Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
            fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, gained regulatory approval to
            run a branch of its commercial bank in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Bank USA received the license on March 21,
            according to a filing with Britain's Financial Conduct
            Authority. The branch will be able to accept deposits, advise on
            investments and arrange the safeguarding and administration of
            assets, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased that the request has been approved,'
            Sophie Bullock, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London, said
            today by e-mail. 'The bank's clients are global and it is
            important for a number of them to be able to transact with the
            bank in London.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) were the largest U.S.
            securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
            after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
            Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
            and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
            window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks.
            Goldman Sachs Bank USA was set up as a New York State-chartered
            bank in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday that first-quarter net income
            rose 7 percent to $2.26 billion, or $4.29 a share, from $2.11
            billion, or $3.92, a year earlier. That was higher than all 24
            analysts' estimates in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financial News reported the approval for a commercial-bank
            branch earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Seek Early Dismissal of Libya Wealth Fund Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will seek
            to have a $1 billion lawsuit by the Libyan Investment Authority
            thrown out before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will ask a London judge to decide whether the case
            has a realistic chance of success and issue a so-called summary
            judgment, according to court documents released this week.
            Libya's sovereign wealth fund says Goldman made about
            $350 million selling investments that turned out to be
            worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The LIA said in a statement it 'considers this application
            to be misconceived and looks forward to full and proper
            determination of all issues by the English court.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libya's sovereign wealth fund is one of dozens of small
            companies and government agencies that have sued lenders over
            deals the investors claim were too complicated to understand. It
            also sued Societe Generale SA (GLE) in a $1.5 billion lawsuit, saying
            that the French bank paid about $58 million to a friend of the
            Qaddafi family to secure investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The LIA must convince a judge that its claim has some
            chance of success to defeat the summary judgment application.
            The case has been put on hold until the court decides on whether
            it can continue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman
            Sachs International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice,
            Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley Sees Lone Trading Jump as Goldman Drops</headline>

            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) posted a jump in first-quarter trading revenue while Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            (GS)'s dropped, the first such divergence in two years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley today reported a
            surprise 9 percent increase in fixed-income trading revenue, the only gain among major Wall Street banks,
            and had the biggest improvement in equity trading as it overtook its larger rival for the top spot in that
            business. Goldman Sachs suffered the sharpest decline in equity trading, citing a slump in Japan and
            emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
            still beat analysts' estimates as the firm posted the most investment-banking revenue among U.S. banks for
            the first time since the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman got a rare win as fixed-income
            revenue was the highest in two years even as the company continued to shrink capital used by the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When the Street disappoints in fixed-income, Morgan Stanley does well, and when the Street does
            well, Morgan Stanley tends to disappoint,' Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., said in a
            Bloomberg Radio interview. 'Weak fixed-income quarter: Morgan Stanley did well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan
            Stanley rose 4.1 percent to $31.11 at 9:51 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday advance since January.
            Goldman Sachs climbed 1.4 percent to $159.42. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gorman's firm still had the lowest trading
            revenue among the Wall Street banks at $3.36 billion, and both it and Goldman Sachs trailed JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Citigroup Inc. All of the New York-based firms are facing a prolonged slump in fixed-income trading,
            which has fallen in nine of the past 13 quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Business Mix &lt;/h2&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reached a settlement in a dispute over
            residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by the fund
            from 2005 to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We now are pleased to see that these cases are concluded
            satisfactorily one by one,' Henk Brouwer, chairman of Heerlen,
            Netherlands-based ABP, said in a statement today. 'We have full
            confidence that all will be completed in due course, evidencing
            that all parties involved are looking to the future, leaving
            past grievances and practices behind them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ABP sued New York-based Goldman Sachs in New York State
            Supreme Court in January 2012. The company alleged that it
            purchased certain mortgage-backed securities in reliance on
            false and misleading statements and that the securities were
            riskier than had been represented, backed by mortgage loans
            worth significantly less than had been represented. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harmen Geers, an ABP spokesman, declined to comment on the
            amount of the settlement. Stampa Communications, based in
            Amsterdam and representing Goldman Sachs in the Netherlands,
            also declined to comment when contacted by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
            part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
            biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
            and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
            market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Donald R. Mullen Jr., who helped Goldman Sachs Group Inc. profit from the U.S. housing crash, is
            giving the firm and its clients a way to gain from the recovery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mullen, 54, has raised
            almost $1 billion to buy single- family houses to rent since leaving Goldman Sachs last year as head of
            global credit and mortgages, five years after overseeing the bank's bet against the imploding subprime
            home-loan market. His Fundamental REO LLC has already purchased or is close to acquiring almost 2,500
            properties through foreclosure auctions, government agencies and even an Arizona non-profit that promotes
            affordable-home ownership, property records show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mullen plans to spend as much as $2
            billion by 2016, joining private-equity giants including Blackstone Group LP (BX) and Colony Capital LLC
            seeking to take advantage of home prices 29 percent below the 2006 peak and rising demand for rentals from
            Americans blocked out of homeownership. Investors, including former bankers and bond traders, are rushing to
            buy and renovate properties, as well as secure Wall Street funding to turn what's been a mom and pop
            business into an institutional asset class. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street Is My Landlord&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This
            is the biggest trade in the real estate space,' said Justin Berman, a former Goldman Sachs banker who runs
            Atlanta-based Berman Capital Advisors, a private wealth firm with about $550 million under management. 'They

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Lose Seven Asia Prime-Brokerage Workers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
            largest prime broker in Asia, lost seven of its employees on the
            regional team this year, said a person with knowledge of the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The departures include Alain Bordoni, a former managing
            director, and Mark Wittet, who was an executive director, said
            the person, who asked not to be identified as the information is
            private. Most of the jobs vacated have been filled with internal
            transfers and new hires, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the New
            York-based bank, declined to comment. Bordoni's Goldman Sachs
            license was removed Jan. 28, according to information posted on
            the website of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.
            Wittet's was removed April 5, it showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was ranked by London-based trade journal
            AsiaHedge as the region's largest prime broker, with an
            estimated 179 mandates and $24.6 billion of assets as of April
            2013. Global hedge-fund capital hit $2.7 trillion in March, the
            seventh consecutive quarterly record, according to Chicago-based
            Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the healthy state of the hedge-fund industry, the
            major service providers to hedge funds are likely facing a
            harder time competing for specialized talent, both versus rivals
            as well as versus hedge funds themselves,' said Daniel Celeghin, Asia head at Casey Quirk Associates LLC, a
            Darien,
            Connecticut-based adviser to asset managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime brokers provide services such as stock and cash
            lending, trade clearing for hedge funds, as well as linking them
            with potential investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Joining Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asia-based hedge funds oversee a combined $79.7 billion of
            assets, having recovered by 41 percent from the April 2009
            trough, according to Singapore-based data provider Eurekahedge
            Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks like Goldman Sachs have been trying to balance
            regulatory pressure to tie compensation to long-term performance
            with shareholders' desire for flexibility to cut pay costs, if
            needed. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein cut
            compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the company went public in
            1999 &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the exception of Bordoni, the other Goldman Sachs
            prime-brokerage departures in Asia were executive directors or
            lower-level employees, said the person. Some left to join
            rivals, others have been hired by funds, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bordoni couldn't immediately be reached, while Wittet
            didn't reply to a message seeking comment sent through social
            media. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs counts as its clients some of the largest
            regional hedge funds, including ones led by alumni such as
            Azentus Capital Management Ltd. founded by Morgan Sze. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's 14th annual Asia hedge-fund event in
            Singapore in October attracted the likes of Azentus as well as
            Asia teams of Fortress Investment Group LLC, Och-Ziff Capital
            Management Group LLC and Highbridge Capital Management LLC,
            according to a document seen by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Elizabeth Arden Said to Hire Goldman to Contact PE Firms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Arden Inc. (RDEN), after
            attracting takeover interest from South Korea's LG Household
            Health Care Ltd., has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to contact
            private-equity firms and other potential buyers, a person
            familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Elizabeth Arden is running a sales process, no deal
            is done and the company may decide not to sell itself, said the
            person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
            private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LG Household, which makes WHOO Hwanyugo skin-care products,
            perfumes and toothpaste, is looking at 'big deals' locally and
            overseas, including one for Elizabeth Arden, Lee In Ick, a
            spokesman for the LG Group unit, said yesterday. Elizabeth
            Arden, based in Miramar, Florida, makes fragrances including
            Elizabeth Taylor and Britney Spears brand perfumes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the Goldman Sachs hiring earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman at New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment. Marcey Becker, a senior vice
            president at Elizabeth Arden, didn't immediately reply to a
            phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Arden shares rose 13 percent to $36 at the close
            in New York, following a 12 percent gain yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Backs Case for Commodity Holdings as Rivals Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
            the case for holding commodities remains strong, bolstering the
            rationale for investments in oil and metals even as other banks
            exit the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities still offer a way to diversify holdings
            together with equities and bonds, and are best suited as a hedge
            against inflation, analysts led by Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday.
            The appeal of holding
            commodities will improve as global growth picks up in the next
            few years, they wrote, without giving a forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While returns from commodities lagged behind those from
            shares and bonds over the past five years, the case for
            retaining an allocation in a portfolio over the long term
            remains, the Goldman analysts wrote. Barclays Plc, JPMorgan
            Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley are leaving parts of their
            commodities businesses, boosting speculation that Goldman will
            be able to increase its market share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Having commodities will be a very useful diversifier for
            most portfolios,' said Jason Wang, chief executive officer at
            Singapore-based Stamford Management Ltd., which had about $300
            million under management at the end of 2013 after returns of
            more than 20 percent from its Iridium Alpha Fund. 'Even within
            commodities, it's so heterogeneous that it's possible to have
            diversification within the sector itself.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Raises $1.25 Billion With Floating-Rate Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
            Street bank that generates the highest percentage of revenue
            from trading, sold $1.25 billion of five-year, floating-rate
            notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds pay 120 basis points more than the quarterly
            London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. That compares with a spread of 125 basis points for
            $700 million of similar-maturity floating-rate debt that the New
            York-based lender issued in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those securities, rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service and
            A- at Standard Poor's, traded yesterday at 100.6 cents on the
            dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
            dollars from each other, was set at 27.6 basis points today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Set Foreclosure Accord Payments</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) will start sending checks to borrowers foreclosed on by
            the banks' former mortgage-servicing units this week, according
            to the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two New York-based banks will pay $247 million to
            almost 224,000 borrowers, the Fed said today in a statement. The
            checks -- meant to compensate borrowers who may have been
            mistreated in foreclosures during 2009 and 2010 that relied on
            improper documentation or faulty procedures -- range from $300
            to $125,000, depending on the how much harm may have been done. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage units owned by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
            foreclosed on homes of 49 military members eligible for borrower
            protections and three homeowners who weren't in default, the Fed
            said. The loans were handled by Goldman Sachs's Litton Loan
            Servicing LP and Morgan Stanley's Saxon Mortgage Services Inc.,
            both of which were sold to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firms were among 13 of the largest U.S.
            mortgage servicers who agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement with
            federal regulators that called for a total of $3.6 billion in
            cash payments to borrowers and that the rest go to help prevent
            future foreclosures. All borrowers targeted by foreclosure in
            2009 and 2010 are scheduled to get some payment, whether or not
            they were harmed by the banks. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Seen Joined by Deutsche Bank on Apple Offering</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which has been advising Apple Inc. (AAPL) on how to deal with its
            multibillion- dollar cash pile, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany's biggest lender, are in the lead to
            help the iPhone maker sell bonds for the first time in 17 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple asked the two
            banks, based in New York and Frankfurt, to arrange phone interviews with fixed-income investors today in
            advance of a potential deal, according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified
            because the terms aren't set. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple, the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, has had
            little need for Wall Street's services since its 1980 initial public offering and its last bond deal in
            1996. Although company co-founder Steve Jobs married a former Goldman Sachs fixed- income strategist, he
            disliked bankers and preferred doing deals without them, according to a former Apple executive who reported
            to Jobs. In 2009, Apple hired Adrian Perica, a Goldman Sachs investment banker, to build a
            mergers-and-acquisitions team. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman's going to be the logical play, but that doesn't
            mean the others aren't going to try,' said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. in New York
            who rates Goldman Sachs's stock outperform. 'If you're one of the big technology players, you're going to
            want to win this thing -- it gives you bragging rights.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for both banks
            declined to comment on whether their firms will lead the bond offering. Steve Dowling, a spokesman for
            Apple, declined to comment beyond the company's remarks announcing the cash plan last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stock
            Buybacks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On April 23, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it would return an
            additional $55 billion in cash to shareholders to compensate for a stock that's dropped on signs that the
            company's growth is slowing. Although it has $145 billion of cash, Apple said it will use debt to help
            finance a total capital reward of about $100 billion to shareholders. By borrowing the money, Apple can
            avoid taxes that would apply should it bring funds back into the U.S. from overseas. More than $102 billion
            of its cash and investments was offshore at the end of March, the company said last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple
            Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who became CEO in August 2011 when Jobs resigned, hired Goldman Sachs
            after last year's shareholder meeting to help the company improve transparency and governance, including
            what to do with its growing cash pile, according to people familiar with the decision. The firm has helped
            advise Apple's board on ways to return cash to shareholders and respond to hedge fund manager David Einhorn,
            who began publicly demanding action, a person with knowledge of the plans said in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next
            Takeover &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cook limits his appearances at Wall Street investor conferences to Goldman
            Sachs's annual event, held in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank advised Apple on its takeover of
            Next Computer Inc., which was completed in 1997 and led to Jobs's return to Apple, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The company is the top manager of corporate debt issued in the euro region, the data
            show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because investment-grade debt offerings typically pay low fees, banks may offer to
            do the transaction for little or no charge, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is going to be a
            prestige-per-share, not an earnings-per-share, deal,' said Hintz, who worked as Morgan Stanley's treasurer
            and as the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. earlier in his career. 'We're really
            talking about a deal that's going to be done as close to gratis as you can get.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple
            IPO &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Morgan Stanley was the lead manager of Apple's 1980 initial public offering,
            Goldman Sachs was involved in both of Apple's most recent bond sales in 1994 and 1996. With Apple
            approaching bankruptcy in June 1996, then-CFO Fred Anderson hired Goldman to lead a $661 million convertible
            bond offering that provided the liquidity for Apple's comeback after Jobs rejoined the company as CEO the
            following August, Anderson said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman was 'the preferred banker when
            I was CFO at Apple during 1996 to 2004,' said Anderson, a co-founder of venture capital firm Elevation
            Partners LP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's investment-banking team, led by David Solomon, John S.
            Weinberg and Richard Gnodde, has a higher ranking among advisers on takeovers and stock underwriting than on
            debt underwriting. That's because debt-sale mandates are often awarded to bigger banks that provide
            corporate loans and lines of credit. Yet Apple's cash hoard means it doesn't need any bank loans, making it
            easier to compete for the new bond sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranks first this year among
            managers of debt sales for technology companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs climbed less than 1 percent to $145.11 at the close in New York. Apple advanced 3.1 percent to
            $430.12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Kion Owners Goldman, KKR Said to Line Up Banks for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co. (KKR) and Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) have lined up banks to handle the planned initial public
            offering of Kion Group GmbH, the world's second-largest maker of
            forklifts, said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) was added to the list of financial
            institutions that already includes owners Goldman Sachs and
            KKR's equity capital markets arm as well as Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
            said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            plans are private. The IPO will probably happen before July if
            markets remain stable and Wiesbaden, Germany-based Kion may sell
            as much as 25 percent of its stock, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forklift maker posted earnings before interest, taxes,
            depreciation, amortization and some items of 747 million euros
            ($977 million) last year. The owners are seeking a valuation of
            about 10 times estimated 2013 Ebitda, according to the people.
            That would lead to a valuation of at least 7.5 billion euros as
            Kion predicts earnings will rise this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion was part of German industrial-gas maker Linde AG (LIN)
            before a 4-billion euro buyout in 2006. Sales increased 8.2
            percent to 4.7 billion euros last year even as global demand for
            industrial trucks dropped by 3.1 percent, as the company
            benefited from orders in China, where Kion is the largest
            overseas forklift-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives for Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, KKR and
            Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Chinese Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa raised $6.8
            billion in IPOs this year, about double the figure for the same
            period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            year's biggest deal was from Germany, where apartment landlord
            LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) raised 1.3 billion euros in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman sold 25 percent of Kion to Weichai Power
            Co., China's biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks, in August to
            help trim debt. Kion also sold 70 percent of its hydraulics unit
            to the Chinese firm. The moves brought Kion 738 million euros in
            investment from Weichai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion trails Toyota Industries Corp. (6201), an affiliate of Toyota
            Motor Corp., in the global forklift market. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Swiss Units Seek Tax Deals</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Swiss units of Goldman Sachs
            Group (GS) Inc. and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among 106 banks seeking U.S.
            non-prosecution agreements after saying they had reason to
            believe they helped Americans violate tax laws, according to
            three people familiar with the banks' actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley applied to a Justice
            Department program that requires banks to disclose how they
            helped Americans hide assets, hand over data on undeclared
            accounts and pay penalties, according to the people who asked
            not to be identified because they weren't authorized to discuss
            the matter publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To gain non-prosecution deals, banks must pay 20 percent of
            the value of accounts not disclosed to the Internal Revenue
            Service on Aug. 1, 2008, 30 percent for such accounts opened
            between then and February 2009 and 50 percent for accounts
            opened afterward. Banks submitted letters of intent by Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Wesley
            McDade, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The voluntary disclosure program, offered last year to more
            than 300 Swiss banks, is part of the U.S. crackdown on offshore
            tax evasion. It wasn't open to 14 institutions already under
            criminal investigation, including Credit Suisse Group AG, the
            second-biggest Swiss bank; the Swiss unit of HSBC Holdings Plc;
            Julius Baer Group Ltd., Switzerland's third-largest wealth
            manager; and Zuercher Kantonalbank, the largest state-owned
            regional bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is considering strategic options for its
            Swiss private bank, including a sale or wind-down, a person
            briefed on the discussions said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Undeclared Accounts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those under criminal investigation are known as Category 1
            banks, while those seeking non-prosecution agreements are called
            Category 2. If no undeclared U.S. accounts are found, banks can
            apply as Category 3. Category 4 banks are those with mainly
            local clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks seeking non-prosecution agreements must disclose the
            total number of U.S. accounts since 2008, their highest dollar
            value, and the employees who managed them. The banks also must
            use independent examiners to certify findings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said in January
            that the department is reviewing the letters of intent to see if
            applicants qualify as Swiss banks. Some banks are still
            reviewing records, and some may withdraw, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least 33 banks announced that they will join the program
            in Category 2, including Cie. Lombard, Odier SCA, Geneva's
            oldest bank, and BSI Group, the Swiss private bank owned by
            Italy's Assicurazioni Generali SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks that said they will participate include: Union
            Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-based bank founded by Edgar de
            Picciotto in 1969; Edmond de Rothschild Group, owned by Baron
            Benjamin de Rothschild; and EFG International AG, controlled by
            Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis and his family. Another 15 banks,
            mainly regional lenders, declared they will opt for Category 3

        <headline>Vevo Owners Close to Hiring Goldman to Explore Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Vevo LLC's four owners are close to hiring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to explore sale options for the
            music video-hosting service, according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            sale of a majority stake is being considered among those options, according to the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the process is private. Vevo is co-owned by Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, Sony
            Corp. (6758)'s Sony Music Entertainment, Google Inc. (GOOG) and Abu Dhabi Media Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New
            York-based Vevo is weighing offers from DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA), Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) and
            a joint venture owned by ATT Inc. and Chernin Group, one of the people said. Chief Executive Officer Rio
            Caraeff said in an interview last week that Vevo has been talking to interested investors and has started
            due diligence with a number of companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We want to create more programming, we want
            to launch in more countries, we want to build better products and just generally be a lot bigger than we
            are,' Caraeff said. 'We think the time is right to bring in some new investors to help us achieve that.
            We're starting that ball rolling.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to
            comment, as did Jennifer Press, a spokeswoman for Vevo, and Allison Rawlings, a spokeswoman for DreamWorks
            Animation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Apple Paying $23.9 Million in Fees for Bond Sale Led by Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) paid $23.9 million in
            fees to underwriters led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) for the iPhone maker's $12 billion bond
            offering this week, a year after the banks led its record-setting offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which underwrote 64 percent of the sale
            according to a regulatory filing, would get $15.3 million if
            commissions are divided in proportion to firms' involvement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fees amount to 0.199 percent of the funds raised, down
            from the 0.313 percent charged on the company's $17 billion
            offering last year. The fee is less than half the average 0.461
            percent paid this year on offerings of investment-grade U.S.
            corporate bonds, excluding self-led deals, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank managed 20 percent of the offering, according
            to the filing. That would entitle the Frankfurt-based lender to
            about $4.8 million of a proportionally divided fee pool. Other
            banks in the April 29 deal were JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Bank of
            America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo
            Co., the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's share was reduced from 72 percent in last
            April's deal, where it collected about $38.3 million in fees,
            and Deutsche Bank's piece was increased from 17.5 percent,
            according to a filing at the time. Apple maintained the same
            roster of underwriters compared to its last sale, with the
            exception of adding Wells Fargo and dropping Standard Chartered
            Plc. Fees totaled $53.3 million on the 2013 deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Mayura
            Hooper, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declined to comment on the
            fees. A call after regular business hours to Ashia Razzaq, a
            spokeswoman at Standard Chartered, wasn't immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Clustered deep beneath the trading floors of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Manhattan headquarters
            are 92 tanks with enough ice for 3.4 million margaritas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman runs chilled
            anti-freeze through pipes connected to the 11-ton vessels during summer nights -- when power costs less --
            to freeze the water. That ice is used the next day in its air-conditioning system, when high-demand
            electricity comes with a surcharge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Proponents of so-called thermal storage systems such
            as Goldman's, which have roots in the New England ice houses of the 18th century, are pushing to expand its
            use. And they see it as a way to help utilities comply with future carbon rules as well as to store power
            from rooftop solar panels or wind farms whose output often surges when demand is low. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A
            Global Push to Save the Planet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'We're going to start phasing out the old coal plants, and
            replacing them with solar, wind and some nuclear power,' said Mark MacCracken, chief executive officer of
            CALMAC Manufacturing Corp., which made Goldman's tanks. 'All of these need to use storage in a big way, and
            thermal storage is the low-hanging fruit.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting thermal storage to take off has been
            a slog, though, as building owners don't want to invest in power savings that will accrue to their tenants,
            and utilities exempt most customers, especially residential ones, from pricing based on peak demand periods.
            Without those pricing cues, government tax breaks or subsidies may be needed to boost the use of ice tanks,
            said Jim Lazar, a utility consultant in Olympia, Washington, who wrote a report on integrating more
            renewables in the electric grid. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Allstate MBS Suit Against Goldman Saches Is Discontinued</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Allstate Corp. (ALL)'s 2011 lawsuit against
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the alleged fraudulent sale of
            residential mortgage-backed securities has been discontinued,
            court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer sued Goldman Sachs in state court in Manhattan
            over the sale of more than $100 million of residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
            including the lost market
            value of the investments. The parties agreed to the suit's
            dismissal, according to a filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allstate, based in Northbrook, Illinois, the largest
            publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, filed similar suits
            against lenders including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,
            Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley in the same court, also in
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justice Eileen Bransten in March denied bids by Morgan
            Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America to dismiss the cases.
            The insurer and Citigroup agreed to a settlement in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allstate said this week that second-quarter profit climbed
            on investment gains and reduced costs tied to natural disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company didn't immediately respond to a voice-mail
            message left on its media line seeking comment on yesterday's
            filing. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
            on it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investments, pools of home loans securitized into
            bonds, were a central part of the housing bubble that helped
            send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The
            housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and
            investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs Co.,
            652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Hires Former Barclays M&amp;amp;A Head Paul Parker</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), this year's
            top-ranked takeover adviser, hired Paul Parker to be a co-chairman of its mergers and acquisitions group
            less than three
            months after he left Barclays Plc. (BARC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parker, 51, served as global head of finance at London-based Barclays before being named to run the
            worldwide mergers
            and acquisitions in October. He decided to leave in May after a
            reorganization of the bank that prompted the departure of Hugh
            'Skip' McGee, who ran the business in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, Parker will be co-chairman of the MA
            group with Tim Ingrassia and Jack Levy, Michael DuVally, a
            spokesman for the New York-based firm, said yesterday. The post
            is a senior position dealing directly with clients. Gregg Lemkau
            and Gene Sykes are the group's global heads, running the
            business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have been hiring in corporate finance amid a 71
            percent surge in MA to $2.6 trillion this year, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            and Citigroup Inc. saw their combined revenue from investment
            banking rise 6.7 percent to $9.17 billion in the first half of
            2014, led by gains in equity underwriting and advising on
            mergers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parker joined Barclays through the British bank's purchase
            of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. North American operations out
            of bankruptcy in September 2008 after talks to acquire all of
            the New York-based firm collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank that announced plans in April to hire 50 people in Brazil,
            has reversed course after the economy expanded less than
            analysts estimated and top executives left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The outlook for the economy and equity and merger-and-acquisition deal volumes are worse than we
            expected,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an
            interview on Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index has lost 13 percent since
            the start of April and more than 20 percent this year. Foreign
            banks from Zurich-based UBS AG to London-based Barclays Plc have
            been reducing staff in Brazil as the investment-banking business
            shrinks and competition from local lenders intensifies. Merger
            volume fell to a six-year low this year through July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About a quarter of Goldman Sachs's roughly 45-person Brazil
            investment-banking division have left, people familiar with the
            matter said, asking not to be identified because the bank hasn't
            announced the departures. Five managing directors, four from the
            eight-person executive committee, are no longer at the firm, the
            people said. All of the executive-committee members have been
            replaced, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The private-equity units of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) are nearing an agreement
            to purchase the buyout arm of National Bank of Greece SA,
            according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management and DB Private Equity are in
            talks to pay Greece's largest lender about 300 million pounds
            ($506 million) for NBGI Private Equity Ltd., about a third less
            than the bank originally invested, said the people, who asked
            not to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak
            publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NBGI's management, headed by Chairman and Chief Executive
            Officer Pavlos Stellakis, is in negotiations to remain with the
            London-based unit after the deal is completed, though no final
            decision has been made, two of the people said. The business has
            underperformed similar buyout firms, with 10 of its 11 funds
            projected to lose about 25 euros for every 100 euros invested,
            according to an April document outlining the sale seen by
            Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're in the final stage, but there hasn't been any
            decision,' Dimitris Spyropoulos, a spokesman for Athens-based
            National Bank, said yesterday. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs,
            Deutsche Bank and NBGI all declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Bank, majority owned by Greek taxpayers after a
            8.5 billion-euro bailout last year, is selling assets to boost
            capital before European stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stellakis has presided over the buyout arm for more than a
            decade and received a $3.8 million bonus in 2009 -- the same
            year National Bank got its first state rescue. He has properties
            in London, New York and the south of France, and has had luxury
            cars including a Bentley and two Porsches, Bloomberg previously

            unit that provides strategic and financial advice to industrial
            clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dibelius was appointed chairman of the global industrials
            group and Scherrer co-head, alongside Dusty Philip, according to
            an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News, whose contents were
            confirmed by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is No. 3 in global
            industrials deals this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The bank advised on transactions including
            Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP's sale of German energy-metering business Ista International GmbH to CVC
            Capital
            Partners Ltd. in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scherrer, currently chief operating officer of the global

            to a management role at the investment bank this year. The

            investment-banking services in Asia, and Christina Minnis, who
            last month was appointed co-head of healthcare Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dibelius is currently co-head of the global industrials
            group and has overall responsibility for the firm's business in

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Promotes Bash-Polley to Newly Created Role</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which gets
            the largest share of revenue from trading among U.S. banks,
            promoted sales executive Stacy Bash-Polley to expand its
            relationships with those clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bash-Polley, 45, will take on a newly created role as head
            of client relationship management and strategy in the Americas,
            according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.
            Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the New York-based firm,
            confirmed the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, has been
            trying to win market share from rivals that are pulling back
            from trading businesses amid revenue declines and higher capital
            requirements. Goldman Sachs's trading revenue fell 12 percent in
            the first half of the year, the fifth consecutive first-half
            decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bash-Polley is currently head of sales for all U.S.
            interest-rate, currency, mortgage and emerging-market products.
            In her new role, she'll oversee the firm's institutional client
            group, which is run by Valentino Carlotti, and will report to
            Tom Cornacchia, 51, global head of fixed-income, currency and
            commodity sales, and Paul Russo, the co-head of the firm's
            equities-trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She currently manages the bank's trading relationship with
            BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's largest asset manager. Richie Prager, head of trading and liquidity
            strategies at New York-based BlackRock, credits her with changing the interaction
            between the two firms from transactional to a more strategic
            bond. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;3i Group Plc (III), the U.K.'s oldest
            private-equity firm, has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to
            advise on a potential sale of Agent Provocateur Ltd., a person
            familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3i has appointed the investment bank to find a buyer for
            the lingerie retailer, which is expected to fetch about 200
            million pounds ($336 million), said the person, who asked not to
            be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Agent Provocateur is projected to generate earnings before
            interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about 14
            million pounds this year, the person said, up from 6.2 million
            pounds on revenues of 39 million pounds for the year ending in
            March 2013, according to filings at the U.K.'s Companies House. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3i bought a majority stake in Agent Provocateur in November
            2007 in a deal that valued the company at about 60 million
            pounds. The luxury lingerie maker was founded in 1994 and has
            stores or franchise partners in 31 countries globally, according
            to 3i's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for 3i declined to comment, and spokesmen for
            Agent Provocateur and Goldman did not immediately respond to
            telephone and e-mail requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Cooperating With U.S. Credit-Swaps Inquiry</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it's cooperating with
            the U.S.
            Department of Justice's four-year-old antitrust probe into the
            credit-default swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm has received civil investigative demands related
            to the investigation, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
            regulatory filing today. The bank was among more than a dozen
            financial institutions accused by the European Union last month
            of colluding to curb competition in credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. also said in filings last
            week that they were cooperating with the probe. The Justice
            Department sent civil investigative notices in July 2009 to the
            banks that own London-based Markit Group Ltd., a provider of
            data on derivatives and bonds, to find out if they had unfair
            access to price information, three people familiar with the
            matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markit's shareholders included Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp., and Royal Bank of Scotland
            Group Plc, according to filings with the U.K.'s Companies House
            at the time. Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News, competes
            with Markit in selling information to the financial-services
            industry. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Lost on Six Days in Second Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
            posted losses from that business on six days in the second
            quarter, unchanged from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's traders made more than $100 million on 10 days
            in the quarter ended June 30, compared with four days in the
            year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
            regulatory filing today. While the largest one-day loss was
            between $75 million and $100 million, none of the firm's losses
            topped its value-at-risk estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $4.31 billion from its trading
            division in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 11
            percent from the year-earlier period. The total was down from
            the first quarter amid a drop in bond prices sparked by
            indications that the Federal Reserve may ease economic-stimulus
            measures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Macro concerns emerged again toward the end of the
            quarter and were reflected in lower activity levels and risk
            appetite in certain businesses,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a conference call last
            month. 'In addition,
            the market volatility created more challenging periods within
            the capital markets for managing client flows.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. lost money on seven days during the
            quarter, including a $54 million misstep on one of them. Morgan
            Stanley posted losses on 12 days, including one that topped $50
            million, while Wells Fargo Co. reported five negative days.
            Citigroup Inc. doesn't disclose money-losing days. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's European Insurance Business Up for Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it probably will sell a majority stake in its European insurance
            business in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent capital rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rothesay Life
            Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, had $9.66 billion in assets as of
            June 30, Goldman Sachs said today in a regulatory filing. The New York-based bank sold about 80 percent of
            Global Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in Bermuda, to institutions and high-net worth
            clients in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is planning the sale of Rothesay, which it set up in
            2007, in part because new rules require banks to hold more equity to absorb potential losses on their
            assets, according to a person briefed on the discussions. The sale of Global Atlantic boosted Goldman
            Sachs's Basel III Tier 1 common ratio by 0.5 percentage point, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said
            last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our reinsurance business -- good business, we like the business -- but with
            the new Basel rules it was clear that business was better held outside of Goldman Sachs,' Schwartz, 49, said
            at an investor conference in May. 'If something's better outside of Goldman Sachs, we'll make an
            adjustment.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pension Hedging &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Tier 1 common equity
            was equal to 9.3 percent of the bank's risk-weighted assets at the end of June under new Basel III rules,
            according to the filing. The bank has said it wants to maintain a ratio of about 9.5 percent, or 1
            percentage point higher than regulators will require. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm's Tier 1 common equity
            was reduced by $9.87 billion because of investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions, according to
            the filing. That brought its Basel III figure to $55.8 billion, compared with $61.9 billion under current
            rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures more than 10 billion pounds ($15.5 billion) of pension
            liabilities for companies including IAG SA's British Airways and General Motors Co.'s U.K. division. Firms
            such as Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a certain age and then use derivatives to
            try to hedge the risk. The insurer typically receives a portion of the pension plan's assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothesay had pretax operating profit of 266 million pounds in 2012, according to the unit's
            website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Greek Derivative &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unit's assets included corporate
            bonds, non-U.S. government debt and $1 billion of over-the-counter derivatives, according to the filing. The
            business had $10.6 billion of liabilities as of June 30. The total asset and liability figures exclude
            inter-company assets and liabilities, which are expected to be included in the sale, according to Goldman
            Sachs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loudiadis, 50, who joined Goldman's European derivatives marketing group in 1994
            from JPMorgan Chase Co. and was named partner in 2000, rose to be one of the bank's top European sales
            executives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2001 she helped sell Greece a derivative that masked the country's
            growing debt so the country could improve its finances to meet European Union fiscal targets. The derivative
            later cost Greece billions of euros. Goldman Sachs wasn't accused of wrongdoing related to the transaction.

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank Said to Fund Debt on 650 Madison</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche
            Bank AG (DBK) are funding the acquisition of New York's 650 Madison
            building with an $800 million loan, according to two people with
            knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lenders plan to package the debt on the Manhattan tower
            into bonds to sell to investors, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the negotiations are private. A $150
            million portion may be carved into riskier mezzanine loans that
            pay higher yields, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal signals Wall Street's conviction that bond buyers
            will snap up the commercial-mortgage backed securities even as
            concern that the Federal Reserve may begin to reduce stimulus
            efforts next month roils markets. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche
            Bank beat out Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
            Chase Co. and Wells Fargo Co. to land the assignment,
            according to four people with knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Amanda Williams of Deutsche Bank, both in New
            York, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A partnership between Crown Acquisitions and Highgate
            Holdings Inc. agreed to pay a record $1.3 billion, or $2,100 a
            square foot, for the tower at Madison Avenue and East 59th
            Street in June. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) and Oxford Properties Group
            have joined the consortium of buyers, Vornado Chairman Steven Roth said on an Aug. 6 conference call with
            analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase, from Carlyle Group LP, is the largest for an
            entire building in the U.S. since Google Inc.'s $1.8 billion
            acquisition in 2010 of 111 Eighth Ave., a former warehouse in
            Manhattan's Chelsea section. It exceeds the record $1,583 a
            square foot paid for 450 Park Ave. in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have arranged $49.1 billion of bonds
            linked to everything from strip malls to skyscrapers this year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance is forecast to
            climb to $70 billion in 2013, more than double last year's
            total, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former Goldman Sachs Managing Directors Plan Asia Hedge Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Three former managing directors of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Japan business plan to start an
            Asia multi-strategy hedge fund early next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Koji Gotoda and Takayuki Kasama have incorporated Golvis Investment Pte in Singapore, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The fund will invest in all asset
            classes with an initial focus on Japan, they added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Japan-focused hedge funds have
            historically traded stocks, making a company staffed by a large team of former Goldman Sachs employees and
            capable of investing in multiple asset classes a rarity, one of the people said. The New York-based bank,
            once Wall Street's most profitable securities firm, generated about half of its revenue from trading last
            quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The pedigree of the principals will guarantee they at least get a good hearing
            from prospective allocators,' Peter Douglas, principal of Singapore-based GFIA Pte, which advises on
            hedge-fund investments. 'After many years of slow death or exile for the Japanese hedge fund industry, it
            does feel as if the industry, like the country, could be on the verge of a renaissance.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gotoda
            most recently led Asia convertible bond trading at Goldman Sachs before leaving in July, said the other
            person. Kasama, a former co-head of Japan credit trading, left the New York-based bank in June. Both were
            among 272 promoted to managing directors in 2009, according to an internal memo at that time. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired
            European financial policy specialist Martina Garcia from the
            U.K. Treasury, according to a person with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Garcia will become the firm's only Brussels-based employee
            when she starts in September, said the person, who declined to
            be identified because the appointment has not been made public.
            Garcia is currently a deputy director in the Treasury's
            financial services group with responsibility for developing
            policy on European Union banking reform and financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission and European Council are based in

            discussing financial rules in the 28-nation bloc. The EU
            agencies are in the process of overhauling banking and
            securities markets rules, from derivatives trading to bonuses
            and capital requirements, in a series of reforms that began in
            2010 after the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Garcia will report to Martine Doyon, the bank's head of
            government affairs for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said
            the person. Doyon also joined Goldman Sachs from a public role,
            leaving Britain's Financial Services Authority in 2011 to head
            the bank's EU government affairs department. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials for the Treasury and Goldman Sachs declined to

            include buying part of BR Home Centers, the home-improvement
            holding company valued at about 500 million reais ($220.1
            million) that is working with Rothschild to study strategic
            options, one of the people said. Also exploring a sale is
            Curitiba-based Balaroti Materiais de Construcao SA, which is
            working with Morgan Stanley, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Lowe's and rival Home Depot Inc. have built a
            presence in Mexico, the U.S. construction-materials super stores
            have yet to expand into most of Latin America. An acquisition in
            Brazil would have Lowe's entering a market where the formal
            home-improvement industry still competes with corner hardware
            stores, even as rising incomes present compelling prospects for
            sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although economic growth is slowing this year, retailers
            still see a market in which tens of millions of Brazilians
            entered the middle class in the past decade. The government has
            also encouraged home ownership with its low-income housing
            initiative dubbed Minha Casa, Minha Vida -- or My Home, My Life
            -- which has delivered more than a million homes, with more on
            the way. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Construdecor Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, Santiago, Chile-based SACI Falabella bought a
            majority stake in Brazilian home-improvement chain Construdecor
            SA, which runs stores under the Dicico brand, for 388 million
            reais ($171 million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lowe's, Balaroti, Goldman Sachs and BR Home Centers
            declined to comment. Morgan Stanley and Rothschild didn't
            respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lowe's is the second-largest home-repair retailer in the
            U.S., with $53.4 billion in revenue last year, behind Home
            Depot's $78.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both companies missed estimates for same-store sales in the
            first quarter as a harsh, prolonged winter forced people to put
            off renovations. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;James Schiro, who led Zurich
            Financial Services AG through the credit crisis and became
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s lead independent director, has died.
            He was 68. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He died on Aug. 13, according to an e-mail sent today to
            employees of New York-based Goldman Sachs by Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn. Schiro
            died of multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, at his home in
            Princeton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2002, Schiro became CEO of Zurich Financial Services,
            which had been the worst-performing European insurance stock the
            previous year. Under his leadership, the company returned to
            profitability, and Barron's magazine included him in its Top CEO
            list in 2008 and 2009. The company, Switzerland's biggest
            insurer, changed its name to Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following his retirement from Zurich Financial in 2009,
            Schiro joined Goldman Sachs's board and in 2012 was named lead
            director and chairman of the Corporate Governance, Nominating
            and Public Responsibilities Committee, according to the bank's
            biography. He retired last month to undergo medical treatment
            for his disease. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jim was an outstanding board member and an exceptional
            individual who made an invaluable contribution to our firm and
            to all those who worked with him,' Blankfein and Cohn wrote.
            'We will remember him for his unfailing commitment to Goldman
            Sachs and to our shareholders and for the example he set as a
            leader and mentor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Navigate Uncertainties' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He also served as a director at PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), based in
            Purchase, New York, and Royal Philips Electronics NV, located in
            Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jim will be remembered as one of the finest business
            leaders of our generation,' Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, said
            today in an e-mailed statement. 'He could see beyond the
            horizon and set a vision for the future, yet he also had the
            discipline, focus and agility to navigate uncertainties along
            the way. He was as respected for his knowledge and intellect as
            he was for his character and integrity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James J. Schiro was born on Jan. 2, 1946, in Brooklyn, New
            York, one of two children born to Joseph and Mary Schiro. He
            attended a local school, St. John's University, on a scholarship
            from the Knights of Columbus and Citibank, graduating in 1967.
            He received a master's in business administration from Dartmouth
            University, according to the Goldman Sachs (GS) biography. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1967 Schiro joined Price Waterhouse and held various
            positions, including managing partner of the New York office
            from 1991 to 1995. He rose to chairman of Price Waterhouse and
            when the firm merged with Coopers Lybrand in 1998, he served
            as CEO of New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, one of the
            world's four biggest accounting firms. He retired in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Survivors include his wife of 46 years, Tomasina; their
            children, Justine and James Jr.; and a granddaughter, Elisabeth. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Cantor Hires Two From Goldman Sachs for Currency Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cantor Fitzgerald LP hired two
            former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. salesmen for its foreign-exchange group in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joseph Pinto, previously head of Americas electronic
            foreign-exchange sales at Goldman, was hired as a senior
            managing director, and Stephan McElreath, a Goldman vice
            president of foreign-exchange sales, was hired as vice
            president, Cantor said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two were added to boost market-making operations and
            will report to James Reilly, senior managing director and global
            head of foreign-exchange sales and trading, said the brokerage
            run by Howard Lutnick. Cantor is one of 22 primary dealers that
            trade with the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the things I've been tasked with in my remit is
            basically to build out a number of different capabilities,'
            Reilly said in a phone interview. 'That includes our electronic
            footprint, that includes our voice-agency execution business and
            obviously that includes our trading business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign-exchange volumes have dropped amid policies by the
            biggest central banks that have depressed volatility and as
            officials around the world probe trading activity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's an opportunity for us as a full-scale institution,'
            Reilly said. 'Where maybe some of the smaller market
            participants who can't weather what is just a bad year are
            having troubles, and where some of the larger market
            participants who have maybe been caught up in headlines around
            the world, we find ourselves building out a longer-term
            vision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average daily currency turnover in North America was $811.1
            billion in April, a 20 percent drop from a record $1 trillion in
            April 2013 and a 0.6 percent decline from October, the Fed-sponsored Foreign Exchange Committee said last
            month, citing a
            twice-yearly survey. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Drops Bid to End Libyan Wealth Fund Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) abandoned
            its bid to get a U.K. court to throw out a $1 billion lawsuit by
            the Libyan Investment Authority that alleged the New York-based
            bank made about $350 million selling it investments that turned
            out to be worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had asked a London judge in April to decide
            that the case didn't have a realistic chance of success and to
            issue a so-called summary judgment dismissing the suit, the
            sovereign wealth fund said in a statement today. The bank has
            withdrawn the request, LIA said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'application was misconceived and issued purely for
            tactical reasons, including a desire to delay the determination
            of the LIA's claims,' the fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libya's sovereign wealth fund is one of dozens of small
            companies and government agencies that have sued lenders over
            deals the investors claim were too complicated to understand. It
            also sued Societe Generale SA (GLE) in a $1.5 billion lawsuit, saying
            that the French bank paid about $58 million to a friend of the
            Qaddafi family to secure investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to believe this case is entirely without
            merit and intend to contest it vigorously as it moves through
            the legal process,' Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A London court hearing is scheduled to take place in early
            October, the fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is: The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman
            Sachs International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice,
            Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Credit Sales Co-Head Shaffer to Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;John Shaffer, a former Penn State
            University quarterback who's spent more than two decades on Wall
            Street, is departing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as co-head of New
            York credit sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shaffer, 49, will leave at the end of the year after
            joining in 2007 as a managing director, according to an internal
            memo obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by Tiffany Galvin,
            a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avanish Bhavsar, head of cross-asset sales, and Jon Meltzer, who's now co-head of investment-grade,
            high-yield and
            municipal bond sales, will become co-heads of U.S. credit sales,
            according to another internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has shuffled its sales leadership as trading
            revenue fell 12 percent in the first half of the year, the fifth
            consecutive first-half decline. The New York-based firm this
            month named Stacy Bash-Polley, 45, to lead management of its
            client relationships across trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meltzer and Bhavsar, who will also continue to oversee
            cross-asset sales, will report to Tom Cornacchia, 51, global co-head of sales for fixed-income, currency and
            commodities.
            Salespeople typically call on trading clients to pitch products
            and ideas and help manage orders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;National Championship &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shaffer, who previously worked at Merrill Lynch Co. for
            17 years, was known to customers and traders partly because of
            his background as a football player for Penn State. In 1986, he
            quarterbacked the team to a 12-0 season, winning the national
            championship with a 14-10 victory over the University of Miami
            in the Fiesta Bowl in January 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said that playing on the team under Joe Paterno was
            tougher than working on Wall Street, according to an October
            2011 article. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That pressure, that competition I tried to replicate on
            Wall Street, but I just couldn't,' he said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He joined Goldman Sachs as head of the high-yield and
            distressed sales group and was named to his current role in
            2012, according to one of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Shaffer was promoted to partner, Goldman Sachs's
            highest rank, in a nod to its history as a private partnership
            before going public in 1999. Meltzer and Bhavsar were also named
            partners four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the fourth-most active underwriter of U.S.
            corporate bonds this year, up from fifth last year, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of
            Merrill Lynch.) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Goldentree to Acquire 144 U.K. Travelodge Hotels</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Goldentree
            Asset Management LP and Avenue Capital Group LLC, which acquired
            Travelodge Hotels Ltd. in a debt restructuring in 2012, agreed
            to buy 144 U.K. hotels leased to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hotels, located in London and southeast England, are
            owned by Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), Prestbury Investment Holdings
            Ltd., West Coast Capital and Aldersgate Investments, Travelodge
            said in an e-mail today. The deal is valued at about 500 million
            pounds ($830 million), the London-based Times reported today
            without saying where it got the information. A spokeswoman for
            closely held Travelodge wouldn't comment on the price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Travelodge is adding properties and renovating its
            buildings in an effort to improve profitability. A group of
            creditors comprising Goldman Sachs, Avenue Capital and
            GoldenTree took ownership of the company in 2012 from Dubai
            International Capital in a debt-for-equity swap. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are well on our way to building a new Travelodge,'
            Chief Executive Officer Peter Gowers said in the e-mail. 'In
            the past 18 months we have invested 57 million pounds in
            modernizing our hotels, helping us attract more business
            customers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The budget-hotel chain, based in Thame, England, operates
            500 hotels and 38,000 rooms in the U.K., Ireland and Spain,
            according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Boost Salaries for Junior Staff About 20%</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which cut the portion of revenue set aside for pay the past two
            years, will increase 2015 salaries for junior employees in the U.S. by about 20 percent, according to a
            person briefed on the decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The raises will apply to employees in all divisions with
            the title of analyst, typically recent college graduates, said the person, who asked not to be identified
            speaking on personnel matters. The increase won't affect bonuses, which are based on the firm's and
            employees' performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms have been cutting
            hours and attempting to improve working conditions for junior bankers as the companies seek to prevent
            defections to competitors such as private-equity funds. Investment banks including Credit Suisse Group AG
            and Bank of America Corp. have encouraged analysts to take time off on weekends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is raising salaries for associates and vice presidents in its investment-banking and
            underwriting units worldwide by about 25 percent, a person briefed on the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's salary increase will bring some first-year analysts' annual base pay to about
            $85,000, the person said. Such employees typically are paid $70,000 to $90,000 in salary, with bonuses
            bringing total compensation to as much as $140,000, according to New York-based consultant Johnson
            Associates Inc. The junior-banker title doesn't refer to research analysts who recommend stocks to
            investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Weekend Work &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Williams, a Goldman Sachs
            spokesman, declined to comment. The New York Post reported on the pay increases earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Goldman Sachs decided to stop offering two-year contracts to investment-banking analysts,
            instead making them full-time employees from the start. Last year, it discouraged them from working weekends
            and pledged to hire more junior workers to prevent overloading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set aside
            37 percent of revenue for pay last year, down from 38 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2011. The ratio was
            43 percent in the first half of 2014, the same as a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Friends Life Said to Hire Goldman Sachs for Sale of Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Friends Life Group Ltd. (FLG), the U.K. insurer created by Clive Cowdery, has hired Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) to explore a sale of its international business, according to two people with knowledge of
            the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Provident International, which has offices in Hong Kong, Dubai and
            Singapore, could fetch about $750 million in a sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
            the information hasn't been made public. No final decision has been made, they said. Representatives for
            Friends Life and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Life is among U.K. insurers
            exploring asset sales. Chief Executive Officer Andy Briggs earlier this year sold the European
            wealth-management unit for as much as 356 million pounds ($590 million) to Blackstone LP and is doing a
            review of Sesame Bankhall Group Ltd., a financial-advisory company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Provident,
            with almost 7 billion pounds in assets under management, reported a 44 percent slump in the value of new
            business, a measure of future sales, in the first half of the year, citing 'challenging market conditions.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Life said in May that it would miss its earnings target this year after
            Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in his budget scrapped rules that pushed retirees to buy
            annuities with their pension savings. The shares have tumbled about 13 percent this year, erasing about 662
            million pounds in market value, which is 4.4 billion pounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RSA Insurance Group Plc
            (RSA) said yesterday that it agreed to sell its businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong after raising more
            than 600 million pounds from disposals in eastern Europe, Canada and China. Direct Line Insurance Group Plc
            is also in talks to sell its German and Italian operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares rose as much as
            0.7 percent after the report, erasing earlier losses. They closed at 307.60 pence in London, up 0.2 percent
            on the day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Partners' Ownership at Lowest Since 2010</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners
            cut their ownership of the firm to the lowest level since 2010
            by exercising options dating from the financial crisis, as the
            total reaped this year from such awards nears $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The partners owned 8.52 percent of the New York-based
            company's shares on Aug. 13, down from 9.45 percent in May,
            according to a regulatory filing today. Individuals exercised
            options from July 16 to Aug. 12 that yielded $107 million after
            covering the cost of the options and some tax withholding, the
            filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The conversions bring the total netted by partners this
            year from the 2008 options to about $390 million, as the
            employees benefited from a doubling in the firm's stock price
            since the financial crisis. The options vested over three years
            ended in January 2012, and shares gained through such awards
            couldn't be sold until this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In December 2008, Goldman Sachs granted 36 million options
            in an effort to give top performers an incentive to stay after
            the bank reduced compensation expense by almost half during the
            credit crunch. More than 34 million of those options were still
            outstanding at the end of 2013. The partners have exercised
            almost 9 million of the options this year, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The awards were granted at an exercise price of $78.78. The
            shares closed this week at $175.47 in New York, after climbing
            more than 38 percent each of the past two years. The partners
            also sold $77.4 million of shares unrelated to the options,
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Data Show Hedge Funds Can't Find Way Out of Mall</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund managers, it turns out,
            are really like a bunch of grown-up mall rats. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's the conclusion one could draw from Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc.'s report on trends in the alternative-investment
            industry. Managers continue to allocate about 20 percent of
            assets to shares in companies dependent on discretionary
            consumer spending. In the Standard Poor's 500 Index, their
            weighting is only 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That group of 85 stocks, from Walt Disney Co. to Nike Inc.
            and Yum! Brands Inc., was up 2.4 percent this year compared with
            an almost 8 percent gain in the SP 500 as of yesterday. As a
            result, many hedge-fund managers, like teenagers who spent too
            much time in the mall, are bringing home some lousy report
            cards. The industry has returned 1 percent so far this year,
            according to Goldman's Aug. 20 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Consistent large allocations to retail and media stocks
            in the consumer discretionary sector have been headwinds to
            returns,' Goldman strategists including Ben Snider and David Kostin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The smaller dispersion of returns within the group isn't
            helping matters, Goldman notes. There was a 94 percentage point
            gap between the SP 500's best performing consumer-discretionary
            stock this year (Under Armour Inc.) and the worst (Coach Inc.)
            as of today's open. That sounds like a lot, but not really when
            you compare it with the 217 percentage points that separated the
            top winner from the loser at this time of year in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;First, Worst &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still the current dispersion, second only to energy shares
            among the 10 main SP 500 groups, makes it easy to see why this
            is a tough group to quit. And, obviously, not everyone's a bull,
            especially after government data showed consumer spending
            stalled in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another report from research firm Markit this week showed
            demand to borrow shares of retailers in the SP 500 has climbed
            to a one-year high. As the back-to-school season kicks into full
            gear, Abercrombie Fitch Co., Kohl's Corp. and Five Below Inc.
            are among retail stocks showing increases in short interest,
            according to Markit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman serves as sort of a Jane Goodall to hedge-fund
            managers, journeying deep into the Excel jungles to learn more
            about these exotic creatures and report back to us on their
            mysterious ways. The additions and deletions to their indexes of
            most-important longs and shorts shows where the action has been
            in the consumer space. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Longs, Shorts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar General Corp. and DirecTV were added to their basket
            of very-important longs, while News Corp. and Constellation
            Brands Inc. were dropped. In the very important short basket,
            Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were added, while
            DirecTV, Kohl's and McDonald's Corp. were dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perusing the full list, it's clear that hedge-fund managers
            are scattered out across the entire mall, rather than clustered
            at a few stores. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anyway, one theory for their 20 percent weighting in
            consumer discretionary could be that hedge fund managers are
            wisely getting in front of a pickup in spending and subsequent
            rally in the shares. Another theory could be that one is not in
            the best position to gauge retail traffic trends if they're able
            to take a helicopter to the mall. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Partners Bott, Shalett Depart Ahead of New Class</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s list of
            so-called partners dropped to 409, the lowest in almost two
            years as the firm is set to name a new class at the end of this
            year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alison Bott, 58, who ran human capital management in Asia,
            and Lisa Shalett, 48, who led the firm's brand marketing and
            digital strategy, were absent from a list of partners included
            in an Aug. 22 filing. The pair retired earlier this year and
            will become advisory directors, according to a person briefed on
            the matter, who asked not to be identified speaking on personnel
            matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cyril Cottu, who worked in currency sales, also dropped
            from the list. Cottu remains with the firm, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Partner is the firm's highest rank, a nod to its history as
            a private partnership before going public in 1999. Such
            employees typically receive a $900,000 salary and share in a
            special bonus pool. The bank's partnership committee, led by
            Vice Chairman Michael Sherwood, selects an additional class
            every other year, including 70 new members in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of partners will fall further before the new
            class is added. Executives including Canada head Jack Curtin,
            63, and John Shaffer, who ran credit sales in New York, have
            announced their intentions to leave at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shalett worked at Goldman Sachs since 1995, including roles
            in equity sales and as chief operating officer of compliance,
            legal and internal audit, according to her LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cottu didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
            comment, while Shalett didn't answer phone calls to her listed
            number. Attempts to locate a phone number or e-mail address for
            Bott were unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Joins Nomura in Saying Silva Becoming Favorite</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Marina Silva's performance in the
            campaign's first televised presidential debate helped establish
            trust among voters and investors, reinforcing her status as the
            front-runner in Brazil's election, analysts from Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. to Nomura Holdings Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former environment minister showed in the debate aired
            last night on Bandeirantes TV that she would be 'reliable and
            not extreme' in the changes she proposes, Tony Volpon, head of
            emerging markets research for the Americas at Nomura, said by
            phone from New York. 'It makes her the odds-on favorite to win
            the election.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva, who captured the support of Brazilians dissatisfied
            with the political establishment and deteriorating growth when
            she entered the race, now is capturing enough backing from her
            competitors to beat President Dilma Rousseff in a runoff, two
            polls published this week show. Equities rallied on speculation
            Silva would do a better job managing the economy than Rousseff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva has 43.7 percent support in a possible Oct. 26 second
            round vote versus 37.8 percent for the incumbent, according to
            an Aug. 21-24 MDA survey published today, which has a margin of
            error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She has 45 percent of voters' support, against 36 percent
            for Rousseff, according to an Aug. 23-25 Ibope poll published
            yesterday. While both polls show Rousseff leading in the first
            round, she doesn't have the support needed to avert a runoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stocks Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ibovespa stock exchange index rose 1.9 percent at 5:50
            p.m. local time today and the real appreciated 0.6 percent to
            2.2477 per U.S. dollar, the biggest increase among emerging
            market currencies after the South African rand and Turkish lira. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva criticized Rousseff's handling of the economy last
            night, saying the incumbent has failed on pledges to slow
            inflation and is poised to turn over the country in worse shape
            than she found it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She handled the debate well,' Alberto Ramos, chief Latin
            America economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a phone interview
            when asked about Silva. 'Based on the polls, it's her election
            to lose.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before the debate, Eurasia Group wrote in a note that the
            challenge for Silva will be to transition from being a protest
            vote candidate to someone voters are willing and able to trust
            to govern. The political risk consulting firm wrote today the
            candidate last night took a 'positive step' toward
            establishing her reputation as a credible leader. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Confident, Prepared &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva was confident and prepared in going after Rousseff on
            slowing growth while fielding questions on how she would forge a
            majority in Congress, said Andre Cesar, director at public
            policy and business strategy consulting company Prospectiva. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva said she could tap support from rival parties to form
            a majority. She said she would select for her government some of
            the country's best politicians who have been forced onto the
            sidelines by the ruling Workers' Party and candidate Aecio Neves's Brazilian Social Democracy Party. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She passed the first test,' Cesar said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva's campaign team has pledged to slow inflation to 3
            percent from 6.5 percent last month by the end of 2018, support
            formal autonomy for the central bank and undo fiscal policies
            that led to a sovereign debt rating downgrade this year. On the
            social front, she says she would expand the government program
            that transfers money to poor families, known as Bolsa Familia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Faster Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Rousseff said that her policies have shielded the poor
            and workers from the effects of an international economic
            crisis, Silva retorted that faster inflation has undermined
            confidence and purchasing power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Silva would support inflation control, the floating
            exchange rate and cut government spending,' Luciano Rostagno,
            chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brazil in Sao Paulo, said in
            a phone interview. 'That is positive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the debate, Neves showcased his experience as the former
            governor of Brazil's second-most populous state, saying in a
            reference to Silva that voters shouldn't choose a president
            whose proposals are unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Brazil also can't put up with new adventures, with
            improvisation,' said Neves, who is running third in polls. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She responded that voters were tired of the dominance of
            her two rivals' parties, which have ruled Brazil for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will respect the gains that were made in other
            governments,' she said. 'But we will correct the mistakes.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman New Madrid Landlord as Investors Return to Spain</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Marcelino Calvo Sanchez and his wife, Maria Luisa, had never heard of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            until last year, when the global investment bank bought the four-building housing estate where they live in
            Vallecas, on the southern outskirts of Madrid. Marcelino, a 71-year-old retired truck driver, isn't
            impressed by his new landlord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs picked up the 289-unit complex in August
            2013 as part of its purchase of 3,000 low-income apartments from the regional government of Madrid for 201
            million euros ($269 million). With the sale, some subsidies for tenants disappeared, and, according to
            Sanchez, a small problem with squatters has become a larger one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't want to live
            with squatters,' Sanchez says. 'This has become a business -- it's not a social program anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's exactly right, Bloomberg Markets will report in its October issue. Though the housing estate
            looks like one of the last places in the world smart-money Goldman Sachs bankers would bet on -- glass doors
            are shattered, broken mailboxes hang open, and graffiti mars the courtyard walls -- this is where Goldman
            has touched down in the Spanish real estate market. Blackstone Group LP, the world's largest
            alternative-asset manager, bought a similar low-income-housing portfolio from the city of Madrid in July
            2013 for 125 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Speed Traders Seize NYSE Floor as IMC Takes Goldman Post</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When Scott Knudsen rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange this week, he signaled the
            ceremonial start of the day's session and the conquest of the NYSE floor by high-frequency trading firms.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His firm, IMC Chicago LLC, just finished its takeover of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s NYSE
            unit, giving it rights to manage buying and selling of dozens of stocks including prominent ones like
            International Business Machines Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Visa Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC
            joins rival automated trading firms Virtu Financial Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc. facilitating transactions at
            the NYSE in lower Manhattan, a role once filled solely by humans. While these high-frequency traders, so
            named because of the speed with which their computers trade, are often reviled by the people they've
            displaced, they're becoming more dominant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This illustrates how market makers from the
            traditional liquidity suppliers of banks and broker-dealers have been unable to compete in the
            decentralized, fully electronically traded market,' Terrence Hendershott, a professor at the University of
            California at Berkeley's business school, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trading on Speed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            ascent of automated market makers on the NYSE floor represents the latest leg of an evolution that began
            about a decade ago, when investment banks such as Goldman Sachs began to supplant smaller specialist firms.
            As advances in technology and rule changes narrowed profits and transformed stock trading into a volume
            business, computers took over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Best Suited' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Given IMC's
            specialized focus on market making and already extensive exchange-based trading operations, we believe IMC
            is best suited to drive' the NYSE floor operation, Todd Hohman, managing director and global head of the
            quantitative trading business at Goldman Sachs, said in a May 22 statement. IMC hired the investment bank's
            team of 15 floor traders, two technologists and an issuer relations manager. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs was seeking as much as $30 million for the business, a person familiar with the discussions said in
            April. The investment bank, which joined the NYSE in 1896, bought the operations in 2000 as part of a $5.4
            billion purchase of Spear Leeds Kellogg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Goldman Sachs's exit, the only bank at the
            NYSE floor is Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knudsen, managing director and head of trading at IMC in
            Chicago, said the firm's move to the NYSE floor was a natural extension of its business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Can't
            Ignore' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are and have been in the process over the past couple of years of building
            up our equity market-making business, so NYSE is an exchange we can't ignore,' Knudsen said in a phone
            interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC was founded in Amsterdam in 1989, and operates both a trading unit and an
            asset-management division. The firm conducts transactions on 100 markets around the world, according to its
            website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a time when high-speed traders face unprecedented regulatory and legal
            scrutiny, IMC, KCG Holdings and Virtu are now three of the largest traders at the NYSE, whose listed
            companies are worth more than any other exchange's. They thrived amid years of modernization and efforts to
            break the grip of NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market on trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average size of
            trades on NYSE Group's exchanges in the first seven months of the year was about 240 shares, compared with
            1,187 in 2000. In 1988, the average was 2,303 shares per trade. Along with that reduction, minimum trading
            increments have fallen from an eighth of a dollar to one cent. In other words, market making isn't as
            lucrative as it once was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Building Scale' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's all about
            building scale to deal with the narrow spreads,' Chris Concannon, president of Virtu, which has eight
            traders on the NYSE floor, said in an interview. 'If you're a small company with excellent technology, it
            becomes profitable over time.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Designated market makers like IMC are required to offer
            trades at the national best price at least 15 percent of the time in the stocks for which they're
            registered, and are compensated with better trading fees by the exchange. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            electronic trading firms have taken over at the NYSE, their role at the Big Board also sees them employ
            human traders who man the posts at 11 Wall Street, the only stock trading floor in the U.S. Knudsen said
            it's a model that's liked by the corporations listed on the exchange. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We do recognize
            in talking to some of these issuers the real advantages in having people on the floor to help out with the
            IPO process and during any sort of market disruptions that come about, and that's just something we wanted
            to be a part of,' Knudsen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intercontinental Exchange Inc., based in Atlanta,
            pledged to preserve the trading floor when it agreed to buy the exchange in 2012. ICE Chief Executive
            Officer Jeff Sprecher completed the takeover of NYSE in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We did have a
            conversation with Jeff before we committed to this acquisition, making sure that he was committed to the
            NYSE as well,' Knudsen said. 'We gained a lot of confidence from him that they are committed to this model.
            It is a big distinguishing factor, if you compare it to the different equity markets.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Euro Parity Call Shows Growth Crisis Draghi Confronts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s forecast
            for the euro to weaken to parity with the dollar comes as the
            region confronts escalating deflation and the risk that some of
            its biggest member states are falling back to recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robin Brooks, the New York-based chief currency strategist,
            cut his six-month forecast today to $1.25 from $1.34, saying the
            European Central Bank will need to ease monetary policy further
            to counter falling inflation expectations. The 18-nation
            currency will weaken to parity by the end of 2017, he said.
            Goldman isn't alone in cutting its outlook -- JPMorgan Chase
            Co. also reduced its forecast today to $1.26 from $1.28 by the
            end of June 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The ECB will ease more, I don't know what easing that
            will be, but that the direction of policy is pretty clear,'
            Brooks said in a telephone interview. 'People had doubts
            whether the ECB is going to take low inflation seriously, those
            expectations are being updated.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro had staged a 16 percent rally after ECB President
            Mario Draghi said he'll do 'whatever it takes' to save the
            currency in July 2012. Since reaching the high for the year on
            May 8, the euro has slumped 4.9 percent in the face of the
            weakest inflation in almost five years, a recession in Italy and
            zero growth in France. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut the three-month estimate to $1.29 from $1.35
            and the one-year forecast to $1.20 from $1.30. That's one of the
            most bearish views among banks surveyed by Bloomberg, with the
            median forecast of $1.31 by the end of the year and $1.30 by the
            end of the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inflation Gauge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro has slumped for seven consecutive weeks, the
            longest stretch in more than a decade. The shared currency was
            little changed at $1.3184 at 10:46 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Draghi last week pushed the central bank closer to
            quantitative easing by singling out the five-year, five-year
            inflation break-even rate, his preferred gauge of inflation
            expectations, sliding below 2 percent. Draghi previously said
            that a worsening of the medium-term inflation outlook would
            provide a reason for broad-based asset purchases. ECB officials
            meet Sept. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the U.S. is moving closer toward raising
            interest rates. The Federal Reserve has kept the benchmark rate
            at a record-low zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, while
            futures traders saw about a 56 percent chance the central bank
            will start raising rates by July 2015, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The July Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed
            policy makers discussed the possibility that jobs gains may lead
            them to increase rates sooner than anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The longer-term forecast to parity is a pure view that
            growth in the U.S. will outperform that that of the euro-zone,'
            Brooks said. 'In terms of our euro forecast, we're clearly
            signaling growth will be better in the U.S.' &lt;/p&gt;

            year, beating its target of 1.5 billion euros, Deputy Economy
            Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at a conference in Madrid
            last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Madrid-based Sareb declined to comment. A

        <headline>KKR Said to Hire Goldman Sachs for Turkish Shipping Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co. (KKR), the private-equity firm
            run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, hired Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) to sell its Turkish shipping company U.N. Ro-Ro
            Isletmeleri AS, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York buyout firm, which bought the operator of
            roll-on roll-off transport vessels for about 910 million euros
            ($1.2 billion) in 2007, plans to sell its majority stake in the
            Istanbul-based company next year, the people said, asking not to
            be identified because the matter is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR's assets include private equity, credit, hedge funds
            and other alternatives to stocks and bonds. The firm has been
            among the most active buyout firms in deploying capital this
            year and last month sold about 1.1 billion-euros worth of shares
            with Permira Advisers LLP in ProSiebenSat.1. Media AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR bought 97.6 percent of the Turkish company, which
            counts 12 vessels in its fleet and operates routes to Italy's
            Trieste, Toulon in France, and to Damietta in Egypt, in its
            first acquisition in Turkey and the biggest private equity
            investment in the country at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.N. Ro-Ro, originally set up by a group of Turkish
            transporters in 1994, increased sales to 221.8 million euros in
            2012, from 218 million euros in 2011, according to its website.
            Sales were 164.5 million euros when KKR bought it in 2007.
            Sailings rose to 627 in 2012 from 609 in the previous year and
            506 in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sued by Singapore Client Oei Over Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong over
            a $34.3 million loss on Brazilian real-yen options trades he claimed the bank misled him into making. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei accused the New York-based bank of fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty,
            fraudulent inducement and unjust enrichment in papers filed yesterday in New York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rejected allegations that it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter
            it wrote to Oei in July and filed in a Singapore court, where the businessman is suing a unit of the bank
            over the same loss. The bank has said it will defend that lawsuit, which it is seeking to halt in favor of
            private and confidential arbitration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A lot of clients are like me, they trust the big
            banks like they trust their doctors,' Oei, 65, said in an interview today. His friends have had similar
            experiences and he is suing for 'justice and fairness' for all clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea
            Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New York, said Oei's lawsuit is without merit and will be
            defended. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei said in the New York lawsuit that he cut dealings with Goldman Sachs in
            2011 after it profited on a losing trade it persuaded him to make. He said he resumed transactions after
            senior executives including President Gary Cohn and Asia head David Ryan visited him in April 2012 and said
            his interests would be placed first. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Suits Over Aluminum Set for Venue Hearing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The bankers are in New York, the
            exchange is in London and the aluminum is stored mostly around
            Detroit. The buyers of the metal suing over allegations of price
            manipulation are scattered across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The roughly 25 cases filed in varying combinations against
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), their
            warehousing businesses and the London Metal Exchange should be
            fought in New York, New Orleans or elsewhere, lawyers for the
            factions argued before a panel of federal judges today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The defendants are accused of constricting aluminum
            supplies to drive up prices in violation of U.S. antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The monopoly allegedly occurred in Detroit,' said
            Christopher Lovell, who filed the first of the lawsuits on Aug.
            1 on behalf of Gwinn, Michigan-based aluminum fabricator
            Superior Extrusion Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The restraint of trade 'emanated' from Detroit, where
            75 percent of the warehoused aluminum in the U.S. is stored,
            Lovell told six members of the federal Judicial Panel on
            Multidistrict Litigation in federal court in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Accusing Goldman and LME of tying up 1.5 million tons of
            aluminum and then charging above-market rates for its storage,
            Superior Extrusion is seeking class status on behalf of buyers
            who faced the same situation and unspecified money damages that
            would be tripled under federal antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Later Complaints &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Later complaints make similar allegations and demands. Most
            of the suits were filed in Detroit, four were brought in New
            York and others in Boston, New Orleans and Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The panel consolidates cases to streamline the pretrial
            exchange of evidence and taking of depositions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The primary means by which defendants accomplished their
            goal was to hoard, stockpile and manipulate the supply of
            physical aluminum stored in their warehouses in Detroit,'
            Lovell argued in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs and Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase,
            have each said the
            cases are without merit. Both banks are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The center of gravity in the United States, if it's
            anywhere, is in New York,' attorney Margaret Zwisler argued
            before the panel today on behalf of JPMorgan Chase and the
            London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Aluminum Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The issue here is who made the rules and how were they
            made,' Zwisler said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs waived its right to argue before the panel,
            from which appellate Judge Marjorie Rendell was absent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Detroit is the world's second-biggest repository for
            aluminum stockpiles monitored by LME, the world's largest
            industrial metals marketplace. Goldman Sachs's Metro
            International Trade Services LLC has the most LME-approved
            warehouses in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Delays of as long as 16 months in filling aluminum orders
            raised prices for consumer-product makers, according to brewer
            MillerCoors LLC, which hasn't sued, and flashlight maker Mag
            Instrument Inc., which did. Mag, based in Ontario, California,
            named Goldman, Metro International and LME as defendants in a
            complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Garrett Wotkyns, Mag's attorney, described a 'merry-go-round of metal,' as warehouse operators
            shifted inventory from
            one site to another to satisfy output requirements without
            actually relinquishing control of aluminum stockpiles. Other
            lawyers today made similar assertions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Not Simple &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asked by panel member U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro
            whether the defendants would dispute that such inventory
            movements occurred in Detroit, Zwisler replied, 'it's not that
            simple.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Whether their truck moved from one warehouse to another
            does not mean there's something wrong with that,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs' lawyer Samuel Rudman, arguing for case
            consolidation in New York, where he sued on behalf of Peterson
            Industries Inc., said truck drivers won't necessarily be
            witnesses in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LME told members last month it was changing its rules to
            accelerate withdrawals from depots where waiting times are
            exceeding 50 calendar days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the changes, slated to take effect April 1,
            warehouses with excessive delays will be required to ship at
            least 1,500 metric tons more metal each day than they take in. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Warehouse Review &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The exchange also said it would review its warehouse system
            every six months and is studying its powers to regulate
            warehousing companies' charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wotkyns, whose client makes the Maglite-brand flashlight,
            asked the panel to have the cases heard in Los Angeles, citing
            the experience of that court's judges and its capacity to handle
            the caseload. Phillip Howard, an attorney for Jacksonville,
            Florida-based pool deck-enclosure maker Master Screens Inc.,
            made similar arguments in support of its preferred venue,
            Tallahassee, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The panel heard about 45 minutes of argument today. It
            didn't immediately rule. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust
            Litigation, MDL No. 2481, Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
            Litigation (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Obtains Veto Right Through Minority Stake in Dong Energy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is paying $1.5 billion for a minority stake in Dong Energy A/S,
            will get veto powers enabling it to block strategic decisions, according to a Danish Finance Ministry
            document. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman will be the only minority owner granted broad veto rights over the
            government-owned utility, according to the Dec. 3 dated document, which is due to be presented to members of
            the parliament's Finance Committee next week in Copenhagen. Dong will only be allowed to sell new shares or
            hybrid capital, change senior management or make acquisitions if it gets prior approval from Goldman,
            according to the document. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman and Danish pension funds ATP and PFA agreed on Oct. 2
            to become owners in Denmark's largest utility, which is shoring up its balance sheet after losing money on
            failed natural gas bets. The ministry is also asking the committee to approve a plan to list Dong before
            2021. Should the company seek an initial public offering before 2018, Goldman and ATP would need to approve
            the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry said the government will retain 56.1 percent to 60
            percent of Dong after the sale, valuing the company at at least 42.5 billion kroner ($7.75 billion). The
            current minority investors, which include local power companies, have the option to acquire new Dong shares
            for as much as 2.6 billion kroner to avoid diluting their stakes, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rubicon Project Said to Select Morgan Stanley, Goldman for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Rubicon Project Inc., an online-advertising company that reaches more U.S. Web users than
            Google
            Inc. (GOOG)'s ad network, picked Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. to lead its initial public offering, according to people
            with knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rubicon, based in Los Angeles, is aiming for a market debut
            next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the information hasn't been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While many newly public ad-technology companies have seen
            their share prices plunge, Rocket Fuel Inc.'s (FUEL) successful
            offering in September and the rally that followed Twitter Inc. (TWTR)'s
            IPO last month have instilled a renewed level of confidence.
            TubeMogul Inc., a maker of software for digital marketing, is
            also planning an IPO for next year, people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ben Billingsley, a spokesman for Rubicon, declined to
            comment. Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman at Morgan
            Stanley, declined to
            comment on their banks' roles in the Rubicon IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rubicon, whose technology automates the buying and selling
            of online promotions for marketers and publishers, topped $100
            million in revenue three years ago and is profitable. Its
            network reached 96 percent of U.S. Internet users in October,
            compared with 95 percent for Google, according to ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2007 by Frank Addante, Rubicon has raised at
            least $60 million from investors including Clearstone Venture
            Partners and Mayfield Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Public Debut &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rocket Fuel, a provider of technology to manage, run and
            evaluate online-ad campaigns, has jumped 68 percent since its
            IPO in September. Ad-tech companies that went public earlier
            this year have dropped, including video-ad network YuMe Inc. (YUME),
            which has declined 11 percent since debuting in August, and
            rival Tremor Video Inc., which has plunged 57 percent since its
            June IPO. Marin Software Inc. has fallen 30 percent since its
            March IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Addante told Bloomberg News in August that he was holding
            off on an IPO until Rubicon's numbers could impress Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors in general appreciate companies that are at
            scale, profitable, have high growth rates and are technology
            companies,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tomkins Said to Work With Goldman Sachs on Sale or IPO Next Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tomkins Ltd., a London-based
            producer of auto parts and industrial products, is working with
            banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a sale or initial
            public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Closely held Tomkins could fetch at least $6 billion, said
            two of the people, who asked not to be named because the process
            is private. Goldman Sachs will help Tomkins find a buyer
            starting in February, or lead the IPO if the company decides to
            go public, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tomkins is more likely to go with an IPO, one of the people
            said, because of its size and a relative dearth of competitors
            in its industry. Toronto-based private-equity firm Onex Corp.
            and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought Tomkins in
            2010 for $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. would have
            prominent underwriting roles on an initial share sale, according
            to the people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse Group AG
            and Deutsche Bank AG would also be involved in underwriting an
            IPO, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment. A spokeswoman
            for CPP also declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Onex
            didn't respond to a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gates, Aquatic &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tomkins owns Gates Corp., a provider of power transmissions
            and fluid-transfer products, and Aquatic, a producer of acrylic
            bathtubs and showers, according to the company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gates is the larger of the two companies with $2.9 billion
            in annual sales in 2012 and $551 million in earnings before
            interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the website
            shows. Aquatic had $114.5 million in sales and had negative
            Ebitda of $6.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reuters previously reported that Tomkins was interviewing
            advisers to help in a potential sale. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Earns Most in Hilton IPO With More Than Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) isn't the
            lead underwriter on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s initial
            public offering. The investment bank still stands to reap more
            than any other firm handling the largest-ever hotel IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will generate more than $117 million in
            proceeds from the $2.35 billion deal as a stakeholder and
            lender, based on a description of the bank's holding in the
            sale's prospectus and Hilton's statement on the final terms.
            That's on top of fees as an underwriter of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The windfall stems from the firm's six-year involvement
            with Hilton's buyout and return to the stock market. The bank
            was among lenders providing $20.6 billion of mortgage and
            mezzanine debt to finance Blackstone Group LP's 2007 purchase of
            the hotel chain. A 2010 debt restructuring gave Goldman Sachs a
            stake in Hilton, and the firm served as a lender in credit
            facilities that are being repaid with IPO proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, isn't alone in having
            multiple roles in the sale.
            New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) also had a stake in the Hilton
            holding company and was set to receive stock in the hotel
            operator or cash from the IPO, the prospectus shows. That
            investment is held by Morgan Stanley's asset management unit,
            according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be
            identified because details of the holding aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Coupons.com Inc., which took coupon
            clipping from newspapers to the Web in 1998, plans to go public
            next year and has picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lead the
            offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mountain View, California-based company, whose
            customers range from General Mills Inc. to Walgreen Co., makes
            money when a customer downloads a coupon for redemption. More
            consumers using digital coupons spurred RetailMeNot Inc. (SALE) to go
            public earlier this year and Ebates Shopping.com Inc. to seek an
            IPO in 2014, people familiar with the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Patrick
            Crisp, a spokesman for Coupons.com, declined to comment. The
            people familiar with Coupons.com's IPO plans asked not to be
            identified because the information isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Internet companies are jumping at the chance to go public
            after Twitter Inc. shares almost doubled following the
            microblogging site's IPO last month. In addition to Ebates,
            Internet-dating site Zoosk Inc. picked banks for its IPO, as did
            online-advertising companies TubeMogul Inc. and The Rubicon
            Project Inc., according to people with knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coupons.com is backed by investors including venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. A $200 million
            investment from
            institutional investors in 2011 valued the company at $1
            billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 100 million adults in the U.S. will use digital
            coupons next year, up from 96.6 million in 2013, according to
            researcher EMarketer Inc. RetailMeNot, an Austin, Texas-based
            provider of digital coupons, priced a secondary offering of its
            stock yesterday at $26 a share, a 24 percent increase over the
            company's IPO price in July. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Charter Said to Tap Goldman Sachs for TWC Bid Financing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) added
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) to a group
            of banks prepared to lend it as much as $25 billion for its Time
            Warner Cable Inc. bid, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group also includes Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Deutsche
            Bank AG and Barclays Plc (BARC), said one of the people, who asked not
            to be named because the discussions are private. While Charter
            hasn't signed a letter of commitment yet, the banks have agreed
            to fund a bid, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charter met with the lenders last week to set financing
            terms, one of the people said. The fourth-largest U.S. cable
            operator is planning to offer less than $135 per Time Warner
            Cable share, a person said last week. At that price, Time Warner
            Cable is valued at about $62 billion, including debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bid will include cash and Charter's stock, and Charter
            may also sell shares in a public offering, one of the people
            said. John Malone's Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA), currently Charter's
            largest shareholder, will contribute cash to maintain about a 27
            percent stake in the new company, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alex Dudley, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based
            Charter, and Susan Leepson, a spokeswoman for Time Warner
            Cable, declined to comment, as did representatives of Goldman
            Sachs and Credit Suisse. Courtnee Ulrich, a spokeswoman for

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Bond Investors to Flexible Mutual Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is drawing record deposits into a bond mutual fund that's making
            money even as interest rates rise, giving the bank a boost in one of the few Wall Street businesses it
            hasn't dominated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX) attracted $9.8 billion
            in the first 11 months of 2013, more than three times the net new cash taken in by the New York-based
            company's previous best-selling mutual fund in a calendar year, according to Morningstar Inc. (MORN) data
            going back to 1993. The $12.5 billion fund returned 5.3 percent in 2013 through Dec. 13, beating 96 percent
            of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund has quintupled in size this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strategic Income is raising the bank's profile in the $14.6 trillion U.S. mutual-fund industry by
            standing out among a breed of bond products whose managers can invest across the fixed-income spectrum,
            including bets that pay off when interest rates rise. The unconstrained funds have caught on as investors
            flee conventional fixed-income funds in anticipation of rates climbing further and spurring losses in bonds
            when the Federal Reserve scales back its asset-buying program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This portfolio has a
            shot at making money in any rate environment,' co-manager Michael Swell said in a telephone interview from
            New York. 'You will see money flowing out of traditional fixed income into products like this one.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Schwartz Owns Stock, Options Worth $75 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Harvey M. Schwartz, who became
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s chief financial officer yesterday,
            owns stock and options in the bank worth about $75 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz owns 175,493 shares of Goldman Sachs, along with
            171,419 restricted stock units that have been awarded over the
            past three years, according to his initial ownership filing as
            CFO today. He also has 302,888 options that expire in 2018, the
            filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At today's closing price of $149.90, the shares and
            restricted stock units, which are fully vested, are worth $52
            million. The options, which have strike price of $78.78, are
            worth about $22.8 million, according to Bloomberg calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 48, was one of three global co-heads of the sales
            and trading division before the New York-based firm announced in
            September that he would succeed David A. Viniar as CFO at the
            end of January. Viniar, whose 12 years in the role made him the
            longest-serving CFO on Wall Street, is joining the bank's board
            of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz also owns 30,000 shares, with a value $4.5
            million, in a trust that benefits a family member, according to
            the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's LEG IPO Flat as Property Value Gains Questioned</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG, which completed
            the largest initial public offering for a German property
            company yesterday, unchanged on its first day of trading as
            analysts questioned whether its homes will grow in value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Considering their portfolio, the pricing was very
            ambitious,' said Georg Kanders, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe
            KG. Many of LEG's apartments are in small cities whose
            population is shrinking, he said. Some are in regions with
            struggling economies. 'The quality of the properties' locations
            doesn't justify the price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien, which became Germany's largest publicly
            traded property company by market value through the IPO, closed
            at 44 euros in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of
            2.3 billion euros. Before the IPO, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            owned 95 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;German property stocks have been in demand as investors
            seeking a safe haven amid the European sovereign debt crisis.
            Stocks of companies that own homes in booming cities such as
            Berlin trade more expensively than those with properties in
            smaller cities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're comfortable with our share price development
            today,' LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in an
            interview. 'Our IPO was clearly oversubscribed. We're a long-
            term product.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Wohnen, Germany's second-largest listed property
            company has about 50% of its apartments in the German capital
            and trades at 19 percent above its net asset value, according to
            data compiled by Warburg Research GmbH. NAV measures the value
            of a property company's buildings excluding debt. By contrast,
            TAG Immobilien AG (TEG), whose holdings are more widely scattered
            among smaller cities, trades at a 5 percent discount, according
            to Warburg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The share is expensive compared to its peers,' said
            Torsten Klingner, an analyst at Warburg Research. LEG's IPO was
            priced at 16 percent above its net asset value, which is higher
            than the average of other German residential companies, he said.
            'I don't see any upside.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;LEG Regions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
            Germany's most populous state. The state's gross domestic
            product is the country's highest, according to data compiled by
            the state government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some cities, especially former mining centers such as
            Dortmund and Essen, have falling populations and declining
            economies, said Ralph Henger, an economist at the IW Koeln
            economic institute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG has about 70% of its apartments in cities with
            shrinking populations, according to data compiled by Warburg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'North Rhine-Westphalia has the highest population density
            in Germany, and it's a place where people rent their homes,'
            Hegel said. 'We have properties in extraordinary locations and
            they're widely spread.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Names Powell to Lead Urban Investment Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, named Dina H. Powell, who
            leads the
            firm's charitable efforts, to also head its urban investment
            group that makes socially minded deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell will retain her role as head of the office of
            corporate engagement and join the management team of the bank
            subsidiary, according to an internal memo sent by Goldman Sachs
            Chief of Staff John Rogers and Esta Stecher, the head of Goldman
            Sachs Bank USA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell has helped Goldman Sachs develop its 10,000 Small
            Businesses initiative that provides training and loans to
            entrepreneurs. The urban investment group, or UIG, has created
            the Goldman Sachs Social Impact Fund, which provided financing
            to a program announced last week to cut recidivism among youth
            in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'UIG has evolved its mission to focus on impact investing,
            deploying more than $3 billion in loans and equity investments
            to revitalize neighborhoods and support underserved
            communities,' Rogers and Stecher wrote in the memo. 'More
            recently, UIG has led the way in developing creative market-based solutions to help address significant
            economic and public
            policy challenges.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2007 and was
            named a partner in 2010. She previously served as U.S. assistant
            secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs in
            George W. Bush's administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell's expanded duties were reported earlier today by the
            New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, VTB Capital Buy Half of Russian Gym Chain</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) and VTB
            Capital bought a 50 percent stake in Russian Fitness Group for
            an undisclosed amount to invest in the country's growing
            enthusiasm for working out. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, a minority investor since 2006, will
            'substantially' increase its holding with the deal, managing
            director Anton Schreider said in an an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is 'a further demonstration of Goldman
            Sachs's long-term commitment to investing in Russia as well as
            our flexible investment mandate allowing us to back strong local
            businesses over extended time horizons,' Schreider said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian Fitness Group, which runs the World Class and
            FizKult chains, has grown to 60 clubs in 22 cities in 21 years.
            The clubs have 109,000 members with 2,700 training and
            administrative staff, according to its website. Pop star Madonna
            came to Moscow in 2012 to open a branch of her Hard Candy
            fitness clubs near the Kremlin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Olga Sloutsker, president of World Class and a former
            Russian fencing champion, said the company plans to open nine
            more clubs this year in Russia and the Commonwealth of
            Independent States. Sloutsker, the chain's founder, will remain
            with the company, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, said in 2011 it has made
            more direct investments in closely held Russian businesses than
            any foreign bank, buying stakes in 15 companies totaling more
            than $1 billion since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of those was lender Tinkoff Credit Systems, which did
            an initial public offering in London last year. Goldman helped
            to organize the October IPO and raised $226 million from selling
            stock, cashing out almost two-thirds of its stake. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to Fidelity Call for Calm After Global Stock Wipeout</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Panic is making an enemy of telephones for Catherine Yeung, the director for equities at Fidelity
            Investment Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'My children hate that BlackBerry,' said Yeung,
            whose clients have been calling amid two weeks of declines that erased $3 trillion from global stocks. She's
            advising calm, noting that profits are rising and shares just got a lot less expensive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Being
            a contrarian and getting in when things seem bad is often a good thing,' she said in an interview today.
            'The companies we are looking into can still deliver attractive margins. Things are getting cheap.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strategists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to AMP Capital Investors and JPMorgan Chase Co. are also
            telling clients to hang on after losses that began with currencies in Turkey and Argentina spread to
            developed markets. The Standard Poor's 500 Index slid 2.3 percent yesterday, capping its first 5 percent
            retreat in eight months, while Japan's Topix index plunged 4.8 percent for its biggest decrease since June.

            e-mail. 'Since we do not see sufficient reason to change our fundamental earnings outlook and stock prices
            have fallen, the market still appears attractive to us.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman O'Neill to Retire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) economist
            Jim O'Neill, who bound Brazil to Russia, India and China to form
            the BRIC investing strategy, will retire this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill, 55, will step down from his current role as
            chairman of the asset-management division, which he has held
            since 2010, the New York-based firm said today in a statement.
            He joined the company in 1995 as a partner, became head of
            global economics, commodities and strategy research in 2001 and
            was added to the European management committee in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In each of his roles at the firm, Jim has served our
            clients by formulating views on global economic and market
            themes and helping them to be positioned for the most
            significant investment opportunities,' Chief Executive Officer
            Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn wrote in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill said in an e-mail he hadn't decided what he'll do
            when he leaves Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tim O'Neill and Eric Lane will continue to co-head the
            asset-management division, and there are no plans to replace
            O'Neill as chairman, Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs
            spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The position was created for him
            when he joined the unit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill developed the BRICs theory following the Sept. 11
            terrorist attacks, after becoming Goldman Sachs's sole chief
            economist, to reflect the waning influence of the U.S. on the
            world's economy. In the years afterward, it was central to
            Goldman Sachs's economic outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Manchester Fan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He is a frequent commentator for media outlets, appearing
            on Bloomberg Television and CNBC. An Englishman who is the son
            of a postman and graduated from Sheffield University, he has
            also worked for Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before joining Goldman Sachs, O'Neill was head of global
            research for Swiss Bank Corp., a firm he joined in 1988,
            according to his biography. That company bought S.G. Warburg
            Co., the advisory firm founded by Siegmund Warburg, in 1995,
            before joining with Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS AG in
            a deal completed in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A lifelong fan of Manchester United, the most successful
            soccer club in the U.K., O'Neill once sat on its board and later
            was part of a group considering making a takeover bid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill recently published a book entitled 'The Growth
            Map: Economic Opportunity in the BRICs and Beyond.' It updated
            and expanded his theory that the BRIC nations would join the
            U.S. and Japan as the world's biggest economies by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Extremely Overvalued' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So popular has the BRIC term become that its leaders now
            meet for annual summits alongside South Africa. O'Neill remained
            a defender of the theory even as the economies slowed and the
            membership of Russia was questioned by some because of
            governance concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his current role, O'Neill publishes a regular report to
            clients, combining views on the global economic outlook with
            details of his travels and commentary on Manchester United's
            performances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His most recent report, released Jan. 25, cited
            'considerable evidence' that economies are improving around
            the world and suggested the yen is 'extremely overvalued.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He told Bloomberg Television in October that he didn't
            apply to replace Mervyn King as the next governor of the Bank of
            England, saying he didn't think it was 'appropriate.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Russia Hires Goldman as Corporate Broker to Boost Image</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) has been
            hired by the Russian government to burnish the nation's image
            overseas and attract more institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has signed a three-year agreement with the Economy
            Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to advise on
            issues such as communicating government decisions and setting up
            meetings with investors, according to Sergei Arsenyev, Goldman
            Sachs's managing director of investment banking in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The pool of investors that Russia talks to is the
            dedicated emerging-markets base, and it's been difficult for
            them to break out to a wider investor pool and a global base,'
            Arsenyev, 41, who handles the bank's Kremlin relations, said in
            a telephone interview. 'We think valuations in Russia remain
            very attractive, and there are many interesting opportunities
            for investors on the public and private side.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin last year ordered the government
            to improve Russia's standing in the World Bank's Doing Business
            rating to 20th by 2018. It climbed eight positions to 112 in the
            latest study in October. While that's better than emerging-
            market competitors India and Brazil, Russia remains the worst
            among major economies in graft, Transparency International said
            in December in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't know how to communicate with investors,' Deputy
            Economy Minister Sergei Belyakov told reporters last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Privatization Push &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy exporter plans to raise a record
            $10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime
            Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview with Bloomberg
            Television last month. While corruption continues to be an
            issue, it's less so for foreign investors who have already
            committed to Russia, Shuvalov said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of 23 foreign and domestic banks
            selected to advise Russia on its 1 trillion-ruble ($33 billion)
            privatization program. Last year it helped advise OAO Sberbank,
            Russia's largest lender, on a $5.2 billion equity sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement with the Kremlin 'is similar to a corporate
            broking arrangement, which every FTSE 100 company has,' said
            Arsenyev, who switched to investment banking a year ago after 17
            years in research. 'It's to make sure the market message is
            crystallized. Our work is strictly limited to the investor base
            and making sure the government is meeting the right people.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Promoting Moscow &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;British companies typically hire corporate brokers to serve
            as a liaison with investors and to help them comply with stock
            market rules. The assignments, compensated with a nominal fee or
            sometimes unpaid, can lead to more lucrative business such as
            managing share deals and advising on mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal also includes advising Russia on its bid to
            transform Moscow into an international financial center and to
            attract more capital, Arsenyev said. Moscow ranked 64th on the
            Global Financial Centers Index in September, a survey compiled
            by Z/Yen Group, a London-based consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's premier financial centers have succeeded
            because of 'good rule of law,' Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
            chief executive officer, said at last month's World Economic
            Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You want to go into a place that's fair, where if you
            make an investment you can recover your investment,' he said at
            a panel discussion. 'You can go into the U.K. and sue the U.K.
            government and have a reasonable chance that a court will decide
            that fairly. There are other places where I think people
            implicitly know they can't.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman's Struggles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, who is a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning
            Moscow into a
            financial center, has struggled to build a business in Russia.
            The New York-based bank scaled back operations in Moscow soon
            after opening an office in 1994 amid a worldwide retrenchment.
            It returned in 1998, managing Russia's sale of bonds a month
            before the country defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.
            That prompted it to withdraw almost entirely before ramping up
            again in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since the default, the bank has been overlooked by Russia
            for three sovereign bond deals in 2010 and 2011 and $7 billion
            in euro bonds last year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Russia could borrow as much as $7 billion this year,
            according to the budget. The government is prepared to wait for
            companies to meet their borrowing needs to avoid crowding the
            market, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in a Dec.
            24 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, along with BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Singapore-
            based Templeton Asset Management Ltd. signed an accord with the
            Russia's sovereign private-equity fund in June to invest in
            Russian companies preparing for initial public offerings. The
            fund is led by Kirill Dmitriev, a former Goldman Sachs banker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. securities firm is led in Moscow by Paolo Zannoni,
            who took over last year from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby. Barter left the firm to set up a
            private-equity group,
            while Raby returned to France with Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zannoni, who had been chairman of Italian investment
            banking, previously worked in the former Soviet Union for Fiat
            SpA. He had been sent to Moscow in the early 1990s by then
            chairman Giovanni Agnelli to buy Russian carmaker OAO AvtoVAZ,
            which was supposed to be privatized. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Moscow Exchange's valuations trail the biggest emerging
            markets, while Russian issuers prefer to sell equities in
            London. Russia's benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) has gained 4.5 percent
            this year, beating the MSCI's Emerging Markets Index's 1.1
            percent advance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB Group, Russia's second-
            biggest bank, said on Nov. 15 that the country was undervalued
            'because of its image of corruption and lack of necessity to
            comply with law.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies on the Micex Index have an average valuation of
            5.9 times estimated earnings, compared with 16.6 for India's BSE
            Sensex Index (SENSEX), 19.9 for Brazil's Bovespa (IBOV) and 13.4 for China's
            Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP), data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Colombia Says Goldman Seeks to Sell Bonds Backed by Roads</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
            to sell bonds backed by Colombian highways, to help construction
            companies raise money for the country's 47 trillion-peso ($23
            billion) road-building program, a government official said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luis Andrade, head of the Colombian infrastructure agency
            ANI, said in an interview in Bogota that Goldman Sachs is
            proposing the bond sales to supplement the costs that builders
            are willing to bear and what banks are willing to lend. The New
            York-based bank would package the bonds so they're backed by
            future proceeds from the highways, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The bottleneck for these projects is going to be
            financing,' Andrade said. 'Of the investment banks, the one
            that's been most attentive, and has put in time coming up with
            ideas, is Goldman Sachs.' The New York-based firm is talking
            directly with builders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn't
            respond to an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has promised
            the road projects as a way to stimulate economic growth,
            builders have struggled to line up financing. Last week, ANI
            extended the bid-submission deadline for the first project by a
            month to March 7, after the country's banking association said
            project bidders needed more time to complete their proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the new program, builders must finance projects
            themselves and recoup their investments later through toll-road
            collections and government payments. The country previously had
            made upfront payments to builders, a practice that led to
            allegations of corruption and inefficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Extra Month &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the 10 approved bidders for the first project -- a
            road from Puerto Salgar to Girardot in central Colombia -- were
            ready to submit proposals by the original Feb. 7 deadline,
            according to Andrade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A couple of the firms told us they were ready and even
            that they were interested in going ahead because they knew that
            others weren't,' Andrade said. 'We want ample participation
            and of good quality, and if we see that because of timing we
            won't get it, then we'll give a little bit more time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ANI will use the extra month to make 'small
            adjustments' to the contracts on the concessions, and the
            government is studying whether to increase the fraction it pays
            builders in dollars instead of the local currency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're considering offering to pay more of it in dollars,
            so that they can take on more debt from outside sources,'
            Andrade said. 'It varies from project to project. We're seeing
            how we can get it higher so that more or less 30 percent of the
            project can be financed in dollars.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;World Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's development bank, Fondo de Desarrollo Nacional,
            is also planning to announce by Feb. 14 the prices and
            conditions under which it will lend to the projects, Andrade
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia is expecting banks and institutional investors to
            finance a combined 28 trillion pesos, Andrade said, with the
            government willing to fund 6 trillion pesos through its
            development bank. Another 4 trillion pesos would come from
            multilateral agencies such as the World Bank's International
            Finance Corp., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Colombian development bank may provide subordinated
            loans to the projects for as much as 15 percent of the total
            cost, Clemente del Valle, the bank's president, said last week
            in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold C$600
            million ($541.5 million) of Canadian dollar-denominated debt in
            the year's initial sale of what are known as Maple bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank, which had initially come to market
            with C$350 million of notes, increased the size of its seven-year offering and priced the debt to yield 173
            basis points over
            benchmark Canadian government bonds, according to a term sheet
            seen by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coupon was 3.55 percent and the securities yielded
            3.568 percent with ratings of Baa1 from Moody's Investors
            Service and A- from Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes' yielded more than the 2.3 percent average
            effective yield in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Single-A
            U.S. Banking Index, where the average maturity is 6.1 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It was Goldman's first Canadian issue since January 2013,
            when it's C$650 million of notes were sold with a coupon of
            3.375 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Maple bond market, nicknamed for the nation's maple-leaf flag, regained some investor
            acceptance after deal-making
            froze in 2008 following government bailouts of banks that were
            among the biggest issuers, reaching C$6 billion in 2012 and C$5
            billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian subsidiary of Wells Fargo Co., sold C$1.25
            billion of seven year notes Jan. 23, with a coupon of 3.04
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Currency Traders Cho, Lim Said to Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Steven Cho and Leland Lim, Goldman
            Sachs (GS) Group Inc. partners in its currency-trading business, have
            left the firm, according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cho was global head of spot and forward trading of G-10
            currencies in New York, while Lim was co-head of macro trading,
            which includes interest-rates and currencies, for Asia ex-Japan,
            said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
            departures weren't public. Cho and Lim were both named partners
            in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are probing whether traders at the world's
            largest banks colluded through instant-message groups to
            manipulate benchmarks such as the WM/Reuters rates. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined
            to comment on whether the departures were related to any probe.
            Cho didn't return a call for comment, while Lim didn't respond
            to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
            investment banks declined 6 percent in the first nine months of
            2013, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd.
            Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the
            currency business had 'difficulty managing inventory' in the
            third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income trading
            revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cho worked under Guy Saidenberg, Goldman Sachs's global
            head of foreign-exchange trading, who remains in his role, the
            person familiar with the matter said. Cho joined the firm in
            1996 after previously working at Citigroup Inc., according to a
            biography on the website of the nonprofit organization Apex for
            Youth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswire reported Cho's departure earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Three banks climbed to the top of the merger rankings within 24 hours after landing roles on this
            year's two largest deals valued together at almost $50 billion, as a mergers and acquisition recovery
            gathers strength. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) have taken the lead, displacing Barclays Plc (BARC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) and
            vaulting Goldman to first place from third, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LionTree Advisors LLC,
            a boutique founded last year, won the lead role advising Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) in its $23.3 billion
            takeover of U.K. cable operator Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The three large lenders won
            advisory roles on the Liberty Global (LBTYA) deal and the bid to take Dell Inc (DELL). private in a
            transaction valued at $24.4 billion. The equity value of those deals accounts for about one-eighth of the
            $205 billion announced so far this year in an MA recovery that may be gathering speed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I
            am surprised the MA recovery has taken so long,' said Philip Keevil, a partner at New York-based Compass
            Advisers Group LLC, which is merging with Richmond Park Partners to form Compass Partners. 'I do think you
            are going to see an increase in deals where companies in one market want to be in more than one market, or a
            No. 3 player in a particular market is seeking acquisitions to become No. 1.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Energy Analyst Murti Retires After 15 Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Arjun Murti, a Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc. equity research analyst who covers oil companies including
            Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and ConocoPhillips, will retire after 15 years
            at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Murti, a partner at the New York-based company who served
            as co-head of equity research in the Americas, will become an
            advisory director, according to an internal memo from Steve Strongin, head of global investment research.
            Leslie Shribman, a
            Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, confirmed the memo and declined to
            comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Murti in March 2005 correctly predicted a 'super spike'
            in the price of oil, which almost tripled from that point to a
            record $147.27 in July 2008. Exxon shares hit an all-time high
            last December as Murti raised his rating to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over the course of his career, Arjun has distinguished
            himself as a leading expert in the energy sector,' Strongin
            wrote in the memo. Murti will continue covering the integrated
            oil and refining sectors while the firm makes plans for his
            successor, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Murti joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and was named partner in
            2006. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, named Ashok Varadhan as the third
            co-head of that division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Varadhan, the 41-year-old chief of macro trading, joins
            Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet in running the securities
            division, according to an internal memo obtained today by
            Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the memo's contents.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Varadhan will help run the business that generates the most
            revenue and profit among Goldman Sachs's segments and that has
            produced many of its top officers. He takes over as the trading
            unit faces constraints from new capital rules and has seen
            declines in revenue in three of the past four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He joined Goldman Sachs in swap trading in 1998, and was
            named a partner at age 30 four years later. He was chosen to run
            North American interest-rate products in 2001 and became head of
            foreign exchange in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a long-tenured leader in the securities division,
            Ashok has demonstrated dedication to our clients and a deep
            understanding of our business,' Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn wrote
            in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $15.7 billion in revenue from
            equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13 percent from a
            year earlier. While it set a Wall Street record for trading
            revenue in 2009 as other firms took longer to recover from the
            financial crisis, Goldman Sachs has been passed by fixed-income
            giants JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Partners Exercise $77 Million of 2008 Options</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners
            exercised options awarded at the end of 2008, benefiting from a
            doubling in the firm's stock price since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sixty-four partners exercised options last month that
            yielded them $77 million in shares, after covering the cost of
            the options and some tax withholding, according to a Feb. 7
            regulatory filing. Gregory A. Agran, who runs the New York-based
            firm's commodities unit, received $7.1 million of stock, while
            Steve Strongin, 55, head of global investment research, netted
            $4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In December 2008, Goldman Sachs granted 36 million options
            in an effort to give top performers an incentive to stay after
            the bank reduced pay costs by almost half during the financial
            crisis. That grant was more than five times the number of
            options the firm awarded in the three previous years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The options show that Wall Street employees received
            substantial awards even after the largest U.S. banks accepted
            government support amid the worst credit crisis since the Great
            Depression. They also echo regulators' desire to have bonuses
            tie employee incentives to the long-term performance of the
            bank, as partners have had to wait more than five years to reap
            the gains. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MobileIron Said to Work With Goldman Sachs on U.S. IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MobileIron Inc., whose software
            helps companies protect data that employees access on
            smartphones, is working with banks including Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. as it prepares for an initial public offering, people with
            knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc are also
            working on the IPO, said the people, asking not to be named
            because the information is private. MobileIron plans to raise
            about $150 million in the IPO, for a valuation of $1 billion to
            $2 billion, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for software that manages data on a variety of
            mobile devices is growing as employees bring smartphones and
            tablets from Apple Inc. to Google Inc. into the workplace,
            instead of relying on company-issued devices made by BlackBerry
            Ltd. MobileIron's biggest competitor, AirWatch LLC, agreed to be
            acquired last month by VMware Inc. (VMW) for $1.54 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of mobile-device management, or MDM, software could
            reach $1.6 billion this year, compared with $784 million in
            2012, according to forecasts by researcher Gartner Inc. Alvaro Monserrat, a vice president at Citrix, said
            at a conference in
            December that the company's primary competition in the MDM
            market is coming from MobileIron and AirWatch, 'who are being
            very aggressive on price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't have anything to share at this time,' Clarissa
            Horowitz, senior director of communications at Mountain View,
            California-based MobileIron, said by e-mail about plans for an
            IPO. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank
            and Barclays declined to comment on the MobileIron IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MobileIron, founded in 2007, has raised about $150 million
            from venture investors including Sequoia Capital, Norwest
            Venture Partners, Foundation Capital and Institutional Venture
            Partners. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gilt Groupe Said to Choose Goldman to Manage Web Retailer's IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt Groupe Inc., an online retailer
            of discounted luxury goods, picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
            manage its initial public offering, according to people with
            knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Timing for the IPO has still not been decided, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement
            hasn't been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;E-commerce IPOs have been rare in recent years as
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) expanded its dominance by focusing on growth --
            building warehouses and lowering prices -- while forgoing
            profit. Zulily Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at
            moms, was an exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily
            is now valued at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S.
            e-commerce company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt, founded in 2007, was forced to cut divisions and
            eliminate jobs after competition emerged for its flash sale
            model, which involves offering limited-time deals at steep
            discounts. The company named former Citigroup Inc. marketing
            head Michelle Peluso as chief executive officer last year,
            replacing co-founder Kevin Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an interview in September with Bloomberg Radio, Peluso
            said that an IPO is 'a likely path for us but we're not in a
            rush.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an investor in Gilt and was part of a $138
            million financing round in 2011, valuing the company at about $1
            billion, that included Japan's Softbank Corp. and venture
            investors General Atlantic and Matrix Partners. The company has
            raised a total of at least $240 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Gilt generated $550 million in revenue, excluding
            businesses it discontinued, up from $450 million the prior year.
            The company was expected to generate cash from operations by the
            end of last year, Peluso said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for New York-based Gilt,
            declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. e-commerce market is expected to climb 15 percent
            this year to $300.6 billion, according to researcher EMarketer
            Inc. Revenue at Seattle-based Amazon is projected to rise 21
            percent to $90 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt's current deals include a pair of Elizabeth James
            womens' sandals for $129, down from $198, and a $449 Hickey
            mens' pinstripe sports coat, down from $895. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Leaving Flash &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some Gilt rivals have moved away from flash sales and
            others are stumbling. Fab.com Inc. stopped its flash technique
            last year, opting instead to let customers track departments and
            products they like, and has cut jobs. Rue La La and Lot18 laid
            off employees and scaled back. Totsy, a flash site aimed at
            moms, liquidated its assets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ventee-Privee.com, a French e-retailer that competes with
            Gilt, plans to more than quadruple revenue in the next decade by
            extending the flash model, founder Jacques-Antoine Granjon said
            this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peluso was CEO of Sabre Corp.'s online flight reservations
            unit, Travelocity, which she helped modernize starting in 2003.
            In 2009, the year she joined the board of Gilt, she began
            working for Citigroup and became chief marketing and Internet
            officer, aiming to make banking technology more consumer-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Join Citadel in Hedge Fund Migration</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managing directors are leaving for Citadel LLC, joining the
            migration of traders leaving Wall Street banks for hedge funds as lenders pull back from riskier businesses.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uberto Palomba, Goldman Sachs's co-head of emerging markets trading for Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, will join Citadel's Global Fixed-Income Fund in London, Katie Spring, a spokeswoman
            for the Chicago-based hedge fund, said by telephone. Jonathan Tipermas, who led Goldman Sachs's dollar
            swaps-trading desk, will work for the fixed-income fund in New York, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citadel
            is expanding the fixed-income operation it started after hiring former JPMorgan Chase Co. proprietary trader
            Derek Kaufman in 2008 to widen its range of funds beyond Kensington and Wellington, its two biggest pools.
            The hedge fund has built the unit by hiring from lenders including Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse
            Group AG, which have seen traders leave since the financial crisis of 2008 as regulators press firms to cut
            back their proprietary-trading activities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palomba, 39, joined Goldman Sachs in 2007
            from Morgan Stanley (MS), according to his registration with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority. The
            bank named him a managing director in 2009, according to a Bloomberg News story at the time. Tipermas, who
            is based in New York, joined in 2004 and was named a managing director in 2012. Neither could be reached by
            telephone at their offices, while e-mails were returned. Spokesmen for the bank declined to comment on the
            departures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fixed-Income &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citadel's fixed-income fund, which
            manages $2.2 billion, gained 5 percent in January after climbing about 20 percent in 2013, according to a
            person with direct knowledge of the performance who asked not to be identified because the fund is private.
            Hedge funds fell 0.14 percent on average last month and posted a 7.4 percent gain in 2013, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Kaufman's team also manages money for Kensington and Wellington, the person said.

            &lt;p&gt;Gilt Groupe Inc., an e-retailer, and
            MobileIron Inc., whose software protects smartphones, are
            working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on their initial public
            offerings, said people with knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt's timing is still being decided, while MobileIron has
            enlisted other banks including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG
            and Barclays Plc, said people familiar with the companies, who
            asked not to be identified because the deals haven't been
            announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coming IPOs are part of a revival in technology
            offerings that includes the debut of Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc.
            and dozens of other Internet and software companies in the past
            two years. The 14 U.S. companies that raised the most money in
            offerings since mid-February of 2012 are all trading above their
            IPO price, a stretch during which the Nasdaq Composite Index has
            jumped 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When you have companies consistently coming to market and
            performing well in the after market, more and more companies
            keep coming,' said Sharon Wienbar, a partner at venture-capital
            firm Scale Venture Partners in Foster City, California. 'There
            are a number of substantial technology disruptions favoring
            startups.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even with the surging popularity of technology deals, e-commerce IPOs have been rare as Amazon.com
            Inc. (AMZN) expanded its
            dominance by focusing on growth at the expense of profit. Zulily
            Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at moms, was an
            exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily is now valued
            at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S. e-commerce
            company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New CEO &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt is trying to follow Zulily's lead after new Chief

            Tremor Video Inc. (TRMR) has lost more than half its value since going
            public last year, while startups Fab, Foursquare Labs Inc. and
            Etsy Inc. have struggled as private companies. Photo and video
            marketplace Shutterstock Inc. has been the outlier, more than
            quadrupling since its 2012 IPO. &lt;/p&gt;

            (RBS) handed out T-shirts depicting a glass it declared 'half full.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years later,
            after the $7.6 billion of securities plunged in the collapse of the U.S. property market that pushed loans
            included in the deal into default, the glass is filling up. Portions of the deal that have been cut to junk,
            which fell to as low as 16 cents on the dollar in 2008, have jumped about 5 cents in the past month to as
            high as 69 cents, according to traders and investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bonds are rising after
            distressed real estate, including properties in the 2007 deal, sold in an auction for more than their most
            recent appraisals. The sale provides a glimpse of what to expect in the $550 billion market as loan
            servicers work through a pipeline of $66.6 billion of defaulted mortgages funding everything from Manhattan
            skyscrapers to shopping malls in Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In many cases the buildings are in fairly
            decent areas -- they were just overleveraged,' said Keerthi Raghavan, a debt analyst at Barclays Plc in New
            York, referring to properties sold in the recent auction. 'This is a chance to wipe the slate clean.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Makes 2014 Aussie Bond Debut as Westpac Plans Issue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is poised
            to become the first U.S. commercial bank to sell bonds in
            Australia this year, while Westpac Banking Corp. is also
            planning a new line of notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is marketing fixed- and floating-rate
            Australian dollar bonds due August 2019 at a yield of about 135
            basis points more than swap rates, according to an e-mailed
            statement today from the issuer. Sydney-based Westpac,
            Australia's second-biggest lender by market value, plans to sell
            five-year securities at a spread of around 95 basis points,
            according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
            be identified because the terms aren't set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
            in Australia with the yield premium over the swap rate on bank
            paper averaging 99 basis points yesterday and 94 on Feb. 7, a
            low unseen since February 2008, according to a Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds in
            Australia since Goldman Sachs's last transaction in July, when
            it priced A$750 million ($670 million) of five-year fixed and
            floating-rate notes at a 170-basis-point spread. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investment banks were one of the strongest performing
            sectors in 2013 and I'd expect the Goldman Sachs deal to perform
            well, although recent emerging-market ructions could damp demand
            a bit,' said Justin Davey, a money manager at BT Investment
            Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rabobank, ABN Amro &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dutch lenders Rabobank Groep and ABN Amro NV are the only
            other foreign commercial banks to have come to the Australian
            market so far this year, issuing A$600 million and A$500 million
            of notes respectively last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The August 2018 fixed-rate bond that Goldman Sachs sold
            last year yielded 106 basis points more than the swap rate
            today, Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices show.
            The American bank carries a credit rating of A- at Standard
            Poor's, the seventh highest, and is ranked Baa1 at Moody's
            Investors Service, one level lower. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank Ltd. was the last of the so-called
            four-pillar domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its
            home market, pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures
            in November at a spread of 88 basis points, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Both Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
            ANZ priced five-year securities in October. The last new
            benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac (WBC) was issued in
            January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There haven't been many primary bank issues since the
            latter part of 2013,' BT's Davey said. 'I'd expect there to be
            solid interest for the Westpac transaction given the lack of
            supply and the benign conditions for banks as evidenced by
            recent results announcements from ANZ and CBA.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is managing its own offering along with CBA,
            NAB and Royal Bank of Canada. Westpac is also managing its own
            sale, the person familiar with that matter said. Both
            transactions are expected to price by tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Joins Westpac With Biggest Australian Bonds in Two Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Westpac (WBC)
            Banking Corp. sold their largest Australian dollar-denominated
            bonds in more than two years today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the first U.S. commercial bank to come to
            the Australian market since July, issued A$950 million ($855
            million) of notes maturing in August 2019 to yield 130 basis
            points more than swap rates, a person familiar with the matter
            said, asking not to be identified because the terms are private.
            Westpac, the third-biggest issuer of bank debt in Australia last
            year, priced A$3 billion of five-year securities at a 94-basis-point spread, according to an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
            in the South Pacific nation with the average yield premium on
            bank paper over the swap rate at 98 basis points yesterday and
            94 on Feb. 7, a low unseen since February 2008, according to a
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. Today's unsecured bond
            sales, the largest in Australia this year, were also accompanied
            by a A$2.5 billion securitized issue from Commonwealth Bank of
            Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'More than A$6 billion of issuance on one day is massive
            for the Australian market,' said Ken Hanton, a director in
            National Australia Bank Ltd.'s debt markets group. 'The level
            of demand we have seen is a clear demonstration of the health of
            the market at the moment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman transaction was split into a A$700 million
            fixed-rate portion and a A$250 million floating-rate component,
            the person familiar said. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds
            in Australia since Goldman's last deal in July, when it priced
            A$750 million of five-year fixed and floating-rate notes at a
            170-basis-point spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based company raised A$600 million in November
            2012 and A$1.25 billion in May 2011, its first Australian
            offering following a five-year hiatus. The American bank carries
            a credit rating of A- at Standard Poor's, the seventh highest,
            and is ranked Baa1 at Moody's Investors Service, one level
            lower. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Westpac's sale was also a two-part deal, comprising A$1.1
            billion of fixed-rate notes and A$1.9 billion of floaters. The
            last transaction from the Sydney-based lender larger than that
            was in January 2012, when Westpac borrowed A$3.1 billion via its
            debut domestic covered bond, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. It's rated higher than Goldman Sachs, with scores of
            Aa2 at Moody's and AA- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Domestic Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NAB was the most recent of the so-called four-pillar
            domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its home market,
            pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures in November at
            a spread of 88 basis points, the data show. The last new
            benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac was issued in
            January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CBA (CBA), the nation's biggest lender, also priced A$2.5 billion
            of residential mortgage-backed securities today. It sold A$1.4
            billion of class A1 floating-rate notes at a yield 80 basis
            points above the bank-bill swap rate, A$610 million A2 class
            floating-rate notes at a 90-basis-point spread and A$300 million
            A3 class fixed-rated securities at a 110 basis-point spread, a
            person familiar with the matter said. Pricing on a further A$201
            million of notes wasn't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Spain Picks Goldman Sachs to Advise on Sale of Bankia Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Spain picked Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. to advise on the sale of Bankia (BKIA), the lender whose collapse
            in 2012 pushed Spain into a European bank bailout, and agreed to
            pay the U.S. bank one euro ($1.37) in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will analyze strategies for divesting the
            government's stake in Bankia, the state bank restructuring fund,
            known as FROB, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
            investment bank, which previously worked on the government's
            plan to recapitalize Bankia in 2012 and 2013, will charge 1
            euro, said three people familiar with the information who asked
            not to be identified because the terms aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Real estate-linked losses at the Bankia group helped push
            Spain into seeking a 41 billion-euro ($56.2 billion) bailout
            from Europe in 2012 as concern mounted that the cost of
            salvaging it and other former savings banks would overwhelm
            government finances. Bankia's Chairman Jose Ignacio
            Goirigolzarri signaled earlier this month that the government
            was preparing to sell off its stake in the lender that was
            recapitalized with 22.4 billion euros of public funds and that
            the process may take more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Madrid, who asked not to
            be identified in line with company policy, declined to comment
            on the fee structure for the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bookrunners for the U.K. government's sale of 3.2
            billion pounds ($5.4 billion) of shares in Lloyds Banking Group
            Plc in September agreed to charge U.K. Financial Investments
            Ltd. no fees for the work, according to the National Audit
            Office. Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase Co. and UBS AG
            were joint bookrunners for that transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bankia group, including its parent company BFA, on Feb.
            3 posted after-tax profit of 818 million euros in 2013, as
            targeted in Goirigolzarri's turnaround plan, compared with a
            loss of 21.2 billion euros in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bankia also sold bonds last month in a sign of renewed
            favor with investors and its shares have gained 20 percent this
            year. The government owns about 68 percent of Bankia. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Arsenyev, Sedov Russia Investment Banking Co-Heads</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) named
            Sergei Arsenyev and Dmitri Sedov as co-heads of its investment
            banking division in Moscow, according to an internal memo
            obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arsenyev, who joined the New York-based bank in 2000, is
            focusing on coverage of the government and family offices, the
            memo said. Sedov, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2007, is 'MA
            captain for Russia' and is focusing on telecommunications,
            media, technology, infrastructure, industrials and healthcare in
            the region, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Sergei and Dmitri will be working closely with Paolo Zannoni and Nick Jordan in their roles of
            co-chief executive
            officers of the Russia/Commonwealth of Independent States
            business,' said the memo, signed by co-heads of investment
            banking Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. Monika Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in
            Frankfurt,
            confirmed the memo's contents by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appointments come a year after Goldman Sachs was hired
            by Russia's Economy Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment
            Fund as 'a corporate broker' to burnish the nation's image
            overseas and attract more institutional investors. Jordan was
            hired from UBS AG as co-head of the Russian business to work
            alongside Zannoni last March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also named Tim Talkington as head of its Russian
            securities unit, according to another memo. Talkington joined
            Goldman Sachs in 2000 in London and rejoined the firm in Moscow
            in 2007. He was named head of equities for Russia in 2012.
            Schaller also confirmed his appointment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Is Outpaced by Rivals as Equity Sales Jump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, lost market share in equities
            revenue relative to the world's top firms last year, according
            to Tricumen Ltd., a financial research company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's share of total operating revenue from
            equities in 2013 dropped 4.1 percent from the previous year,
            while sales by the bank's peer group rose a combined 15 percent,
            Tricumen said in a report published today. UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland's
            biggest bank, expanded its share by 1.4 percent, the largest
            gain in the group, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost ground in equity derivatives due to its
            limited range of services and products compared with No. 1
            competitor JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), said Darko Kapor, a partner at
            London-based Tricumen. Goldman Sachs fell to sixth from the
            second rank by revenue in equity derivatives last year, and to
            third from second in servicing hedge funds, according to
            Tricumen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, reported $15.7 billion in
            revenue from equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13
            percent from a year earlier, hurt mostly by interest-rate and
            currency trading. In stocks, it remained the leader for cash
            equities last year and is also the No. 1 in proprietary trading
            by revenue, Tricumen data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tricumen uses corporate filings and its own industry data
            to compile the rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Asset Buys Rupee to Join William Blair on Deficit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management and
            William Blair Investment Management are buying the rupee as
            India reins in a current-account deficit that drove the currency
            to a record low in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee, which slid 21 percent in the past two years,
            looks 'cheap' relative to India's improving external finances,
            according to Goldman Sachs Asset, which opened a 'small long'
            position on the currency this year. William Blair has boosted
            the currency to about 20 percent of its foreign-exchange
            holdings for its higher yield and inexpensive valuation, said
            Chicago-based fund manager Brian D. Singer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee has rebounded more than 10 percent from last
            year's all-time low of 68.845 per dollar as India curbed gold
            imports to shore up the current account and the central bank
            acted to spur dollar inflows. Only Indonesia's rupiah has fallen
            more than the rupee among Asian emerging markets. While India's
            finances have improved since last year, the nation needs a
            coordinated plan to respond to volatility in global currency
            markets as the U.S. reduces stimulus, the International Monetary
            Fund said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'current-account numbers have been the key driver
            because it's a very transparent measure of whether the policy
            prescriptions are having an impact,' Philip Moffitt, Sydney-based head of fixed income for Asia-Pacific at
            Goldman Sachs
            Asset, which oversaw more than $1 trillion on Dec. 31, said in
            an e-mail interview yesterday. 'If you can find something
            that's relatively cheap and the fundamentals appear to be
            improving, it's usually a good mix.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Principal Risk' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade will shrink
            to $45 billion in the year through March from an unprecedented
            $88 billion the previous period, the government said Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The principal risk facing India is the inward spillover
            from a tightening of global liquidity interacting with domestic
            vulnerabilities,' the IMF said in the report. Pressures
            associated with India's 'still-significant external financing
            need' could lead to higher borrowing costs, fund outflows and
            'disorderly adjustments' in the exchange rate, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Any plan should make rupee flexibility the key defense and
            include measures to raise the benchmark interest rate, impose
            cash curbs, open foreign-exchange swap windows and raise diesel
            prices, the Washington-based lender said in an annual review of
            India's economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Current Account &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar-based investors will earn 9 percent including
            interest by holding the rupee until the end of 2014, the second-biggest return in Asia, according to
            Bloomberg data based on
            appreciation estimates and deposit rates. Two-year government
            bonds pay 8.67 percent in India, compared with 0.31 percent in
            the U.S. and 3.70 percent in China. The rupee was at 62.23 per
            dollar yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's current-account shortfall decreased to $5.2 billion
            in the third quarter of 2013, from $21.8 billion in the previous
            three months, after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
            raised tariffs on gold in the world's largest bullion-consuming
            nation. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan lured $34
            billion of foreign-currency inflows by offering discounted swaps
            for dollars raised by banks, one of his first steps on taking
            office on Sept. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rajan has also raised interest rates three times so far,
            helping curb consumer-price inflation to 8.79 percent last month
            from as much as 11.2 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Confidence &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Options are signaling increased confidence in the rupee as
            external balances improve and price pressures cool. One-month
            implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
            rate used to price options, has eased to 8.17 percent from last
            year's peak of 22.4 percent in September, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carry traders, who borrow in currencies with lower yields
            and buy those with higher rates, have earned 4.1 percent on
            rupee investments using dollars since Sept. 30, the most among
            23 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Favorable
            policies will help the rupee and Indonesia's rupiah perform
            better than currencies of other nations with current-account
            deficits such as Brazil, Turkey and South Africa, Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. economist Fiona Lake wrote in a Feb. 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appointment of Rajan, an economist credited with
            presaging the 2008 global financial crisis, as the RBI's head
            encouraged William Blair, which oversaw more than $72 billion as
            of Dec. 31, to boost bullish positions on the rupee, according
            to portfolio manager Singer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The rupee is a cheap currency with significant carry,'
            he said in an interview in Melbourne yesterday. It 'has
            deviated from fundamentals and should not be included in the
            fragile five,' he added, referring to a description used by
            Morgan Stanley last year to describe currencies most vulnerable
            to capital flight. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Turkish Air Said Hires Goldman, Citi to Sell Jet-Backed Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Turkish Airlines has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) to sell debt backed
            by aircraft as it builds a fleet capable of taking on Europe's leading carriers, three people familiar with
            the plan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company aims to sell the enhanced equipment trust certificates this
            year, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the plan is confidential. The amount of
            debt to be sold could approach $1 billion, one person said. Chief Executive Officer Temel Kotil said Feb. 11
            that the company is working on a plan to sell EETCs, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EETCs allow
            airlines to issue investment-grade debt at lower yields and transfer the burden of financing fleet orders to
            the bond market. Purchases employing such instruments, which give investors a claim on planes if a carrier
            goes bankrupt, generally involve funding from multiple parties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The securities will
            allow Turk Hava Yollari AO, as the carrier is formally known, to tap EETC investors in the U.S., two of the
            people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Istanbul-based company aims to double its fleet to about 450 planes by
            2020 after last year ordering 117 single-aisle planes from Airbus SAS and 95 from Boeing Co. (BA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turkish Air has embarked on an expansion as it builds its home airport into a long-haul transfer
            hub linking Europe and North America with Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The carrier will boost transit
            traffic to 70 percent of the international total by 2020 from about 40 percent today and should double its
            passenger tally to 100 million, according to Kotil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulf carriers such as Emirates
            employing a similar model are already capturing traffic from hubs operated by carriers including Air
            France-KLM Group (AF) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevnihal Ciftci, a spokeswoman
            for Citigroup in Turkey, declined to comment. Ali Genc, a Turkish Airlines spokesman, wasn't immediately
            available for comment, while Goldman Sachs spokesman didn't reply to calls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turkish
            Airlines (THYAO) fell as much as 2 percent to 6.77 liras in Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Egol Retires After Heading Team That Made Abacus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Egol, a Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. trader whose desk produced the security that prompted the
            Securities and Exchange Commission to sue the firm, has retired. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egol, 44, left the New York-based bank earlier this year,
            said Michael DuVally, a company spokesman. He joined the firm in
            1998 and was named a managing director in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid a then-record $550 million in 2010 to
            settle an SEC suit over the marketing of a synthetic
            collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. The firm
            created a committee that year to review its business standards
            and practices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Fabrice Tourre, 35, one of the employees under
            Egol, after dropping a plan to file claims against Egol,
            according to interviews with SEC enforcement staff conducted by
            the agency's inspector general. Tourre was found liable in a
            jury trial last year in which the SEC claimed he intentionally
            misled investors in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egol testified in Tourre's trial in July that he was 'not
            aware of any' disclosures to investors that Paulson Co.,
            which stood to make money from the failure of the transaction,
            helped select the assets underlying it. Egol said Tourre did
            tell a superior that the hedge-fund firm run by billionaire John Paulson helped pick the portfolio of 90
            subprime mortgage-backed
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the departure earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Posted Losses on 27 Days Last Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generated 46 percent of revenue from sales and trading last
            year, recorded losses from that business on 27 days in 2013, up
            from 16 the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;None of the daily losses exceeded the firm's value-at-risk,
            an estimate of potential losses with 95 percent confidence, the
            New York-based company said today in a filing with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. Traders made more than $100
            million on 34 days, down from 41 days a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's trading revenue fell 15 percent to $16
            billion in 2013, excluding accounting charges, as the firm
            generated less from bond trading and sold a reinsurance unit
            that reported its results in the firm's equities segment. The
            bank's net income climbed 6 percent as Chief Executive Officer
            Lloyd C. Blankfein set aside a lower portion of revenue for pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world's biggest brokerage,
            reported this week that it lost money in its trading business on
            33 days last year, down from 37 in 2012 and the fewest since
            2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, revised its
            gauge of market gains and losses to incorporate new regulatory
            requirements, resulting in a jump in the frequency of losses
            last year. Under the new method, JPMorgan posted gains on 177 of
            the 260 trading days in 2013, while the old measurement showed
            losses on zero days. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's 'Reasonably Possible' Legal Losses Drop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which more
            than doubled the amount it set aside for litigation costs in
            2013, said 'reasonably possible' legal losses beyond those
            reserves were $3.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The figure dropped from $4 billion at the end of the third
            quarter, while rising from $3.5 billion a year earlier, the New
            York-based bank said today in an annual regulatory filing. The
            estimate doesn't include potential claims from investigations by
            the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the
            U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs added some items to its list of activities
            that are subject to current regulatory investigations and
            reviews, including 'allocations of and trading in fixed-income
            securities,' its financial-advisory services and interactions
            between the bank's research analysts and third parties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $962 million of net provisions for
            litigation and regulatory proceedings in 2013, primarily tied to
            mortgage-related matters, up from $448 million in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Awards Employees $2.3 Billion of Restricted Stock</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
            employees restricted stock worth $2.3 billion for their 2013
            performance, the smallest amount in two years as the firm cut
            costs by lowering the portion of revenue it set aside for pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm granted 13.8 million restricted shares that vest
            over several years, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in
            its annual regulatory filing. The value, down from $2.4 billion
            a year earlier, is based on the closing price on Jan. 28, when
            senior executives were given their awards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
            compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the firm went public in
            1999. That
            contributed to a 6 percent increase in net income even as
            revenue was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have been seeking to balance regulatory pressure to
            tie awards to long-term performance with shareholders' desire
            for flexibility to cut pay costs if needed. Goldman Sachs Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz, 49, has said the firm is
            reluctant to ramp up the amount of pay it defers because it is
            'a bit of mortgaging the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said about 70 percent of the restricted stock
            awards were recognized as expenses immediately. The cost
            recorded by the firm is probably lower than the current value of
            the shares because the bank accounts for the fact that employees
            can't immediately sell the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world's largest brokerage,
            gave employees $2.72 billion in deferred awards for 2013
            performance, including $1.25 billion of restricted stock and
            $1.47 billion of deferred cash. About $100 million of the awards
            were expensed in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn't disclose any deferred cash awards, and
            the firm hasn't typically given such bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Plans IPO of German Homes Unit With $6.1 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
            that sold its stake in Germany's largest department store last
            month, plans to sell shares in a unit that owns homes valued at
            4.7 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An initial public offering of LEG Immobilien GmbH is
            planned for the first half, LEG said in a statement today. The
            sale may raise as much as 1 billion euros, said two people with
            knowledge of the plan. Another person familiar with the IPO said
            it will probably take place in early February. Both people asked
            not to be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG would be Germany's biggest property IPO if it raises 1
            billion euros. The Dusseldorf-based landlord owns 91,000
            apartments in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous
            state. Goldman Sachs' Whitehall Street Real Estate fund holds
            about 95 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fundamentals for the segment are very good,' said
            Thomas Martin, an analyst at HSBC Trinkaus Burkhardt AG. (TUB)
            'Because some of their competitors are trading expensively,
            this could be an interesting way for stock investors to get
            in.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Baubecon Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
            in German property. In April 2011, Whitehall Street and Cerberus
            Capital Management LP raised 468 million euros in an IPO of
            Berlin-based residential landlord GSW Immobilien AG. Whitehall
            Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy Baubecon, the
            residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC) agreed to sell
            to Deutsche Wohnen AG in May in a deal valued at 1.24 billion
            euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and LEG co-owner Perry Capital, which bought
            the company from the state government for about 3.5 billion
            euros in 2008, are seeking to profit from a boom in German
            residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit index of German
            property stocks has gained 42 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers
            and bookrunners for the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Annington Immobilien GmbH, Germany's largest owner
            of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington, which has
            186,000 apartments, is controlled by Guy Hands' Terra Firma
            Capital Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in 17 German
            department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the country's
            largest, in December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SocGen Rates Goldman, Deutsche Bank Sell Amid Bond Bear Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should sell Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) because a bear market in bonds
            will hurt trading revenue, analysts at Societe Generale SA (GLE) wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should buy UBS AG (UBSN), while Morgan Stanley (MS) and
            Credit Suisse Group AG were given hold ratings, analysts
            including Andrew Lim wrote in a note today that began coverage
            of the five firms. Fixed-income trading revenue will drop by
            'low-single-digit' percentages, while equity trading climbs by
            the same amount, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve's decision to taper its monthly bond
            purchases probably will lead to lower prices for similar assets,
            the analysts wrote. Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and
            commodity trading, or FICC, probably fell to $73 billion at the
            10 largest global investment banks in 2013, about half the level
            of 2009, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect FICC weakness to be an ongoing structural theme
            -- not a temporary issue -- in a rising U.S. long interest-rate
            environment,' the analysts wrote. More money will move into
            equities 'as investors veer away from the bond bear market,'
            they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulatory limits on leverage will force Goldman Sachs to
            curtail its capital return policy and Credit Suisse (CSGN) to take more
            actions to boost its ratios, the analysts wrote. Goldman Sachs
            and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, probably will show
            they hold more risk-weighted assets after regulators review
            their trading books, pushing down their capital ratios,
            according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, named Dan Dees co-head of the
            global technology, media and telecom group and shuffled managers
            in its Asia-Pacific operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;George Lee, current head of the TMT group, will become the
            unit's chairman, as well as chief information officer for the
            investment banking division, the New York-based firm said
            yesterday in memos to the staff. David Wells, a spokesman for
            the company, confirmed the authenticity of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dees will move from Hong Kong to San Francisco and become
            co-head of TMT alongside Anthony Noto. A former Internet analyst
            and chief financial officer of the National Football League,
            Noto works out of New York. He helped Goldman Sachs win the lead
            underwriting spot on last year's initial public offering of
            Twitter Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dees and Noto will run a group that ranked first in
            advising technology, media and telecom companies on mergers and
            acquisitions. Those industries accounted for more than a quarter
            of deal volume last year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The TMT sectors continue to evolve rapidly on a global
            basis and present significant strategic opportunities for our
            clients and for the firm,' Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and
            John S. Weinberg, Goldman Sachs's co-heads of investment
            banking, said in a memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Bank Said to Hire Goldman's Malaysia Head Yusof Annuar</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG recruited Yusof Annuar Yaacob, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Malaysia chairman for
            corporate finance, as its country head, according to four people
            with knowledge of the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar, 48, will start work as the German bank's
            chief country officer and head of Malaysian corporate banking
            and securities from the end of February, said one the people,
            who asked not to be named because the information is private.
            His appointment was approved by the nation's central bank last
            week, one of them said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is building its presence in Southeast Asia as
            economic growth in the region outperforms developed nations. The
            firm handled 208 million ringgit of equity-linked deals in
            Malaysia last year, ranking it sixth among foreign lenders,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount is about a
            quarter of second-placed Goldman Sachs's share, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar, a former chief financial officer at Malaysian
            mobile-phone company Axiata Group Bhd., joined Goldman in
            November 2010. The New York-based bank helped manage some of the
            country's biggest initial share sales last year, including
            offerings by Westports Holdings Bhd. and UMW Oil Gas Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman also made about $500 million arranging three bond
            sales for state-owned 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a person
            familiar with the matter said in May 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Candice Sun, a Deutsche Bank spokeswomen in Hong Kong,
            declined to comment by e-mail. Reuters first reported on the
            appointment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar is the latest in several recent key
            appointments by Deutsche in Southeast Asia over the past year.
            It also tapped Tan Boon-Kee, another former Goldman employee, as
            head of client coverage in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Phumchai Kambhato, a former country head of investment
            banking at UBS, joined as head of Thai corporate banking and
            finance. Philip Lee, a former head of Southeast Asia investment
            banking at JPMorgan Chase Co., is now the German bank's vice
            chairman for Southeast Asia and Singapore head. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Swap Fees for Stake in Cantab Hedge Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has taken a
            stake in Cantab Capital Partners LLP after the two firms revised
            the terms of a licensing agreement the hedge fund had used to
            pay the New York-based bank for using its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cantab paid Goldman Sachs fees as part of a deal when the
            firm started in 2006, according to two people with knowledge of
            the matter who declined to be identified because Cantab is
            private. They restructured it last year, with Goldman Sachs
            giving up the fees in exchange for a minority ownership stake in
            Cantab, they said. Cantab, based in Cambridge, England, told its
            investors of the change in a letter earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As you are aware, we have been spending 2012 building our
            own' information-technology system, Cantab Chief Investment
            Officer Ewan Kirk said in the letter, which was obtained by
            Bloomberg News. 'As part of this, the existing profit-share
            arrangement with Goldman Sachs has been amended and as from
            December 31, Goldman Sachs will become a partner.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kirk, who has a doctorate in mathematics from England's
            University of Southampton, led a team of 120 employees at
            Goldman Sachs focused on quantitative investing before he
            founded Cantab with $60 million. The hedge fund, which relies on
            computers and mathematical algorithms to spot trades, has grown
            to manage $4.7 billion, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Quant Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials at Cantab and Goldman Sachs declined to comment
            on the size of the bank's stake in the hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn't invested in Cantab or paid any money
            for the stake as part of the restricting of the licensing deal,
            one of the people said. The Cantab position isn't held by
            Goldman Sachs' Petershill unit, which uses client money to buy
            stakes in hedge funds, the person added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cantab, which has stopped accepting money from new
            investors, gained 15 percent last year and 13 percent in 2011,
            according to the client letter. Others have lost money as
            political announcements whipsawed markets and broke up the
            trends in asset prices that quant funds try to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Newedge CTA Trend Sub-Index, which tracks the
            performance of the largest computer-driven hedge funds, fell 3.4
            percent in 2012 and 7.9 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Secret Goldman Team Sidesteps Volcker After Blankfein Vow</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sitting onstage in Washington's Ronald Reagan Building in July, Lloyd C. Blankfein said Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had stopped using its own money to make bets on the bank's behalf. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We
            shut off that activity,' the chief executive officer told more than 400 people at a lunch organized by the
            Economic Club of Washington, D.C., slicing the air with his hand. The bank no longer had proprietary traders
            who 'just put on risks that they wanted' and didn't interact with clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
            may come as a surprise to people working in a secretive Goldman Sachs group called Multi-Strategy Investing,
            or MSI. It wagers about $1 billion of the New York-based firm's own funds on the stocks and bonds of
            companies, including a mortgage servicer and a cement producer, according to interviews with more than 20
            people who worked for and with the group, some as recently as last year. The unit, headed by two 1999
            Princeton University classmates, has no clients, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team's survival
            shows how Goldman Sachs has worked around regulations curbing proprietary bets at banks. Former Federal
            Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker singled out the company in 2009, saying it shouldn't get taxpayer support
            if it focuses on trading. A section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker rule, drafted to prevent
            banks from taking on excessive risk, limits short-term investments made with firms' capital. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dimitrios Kavvathas, a Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) partner, co-head of Asia Pacific excluding Japan
            securities distribution, and head of structuring in the region,
            will retire, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, James Houghton, also a partner, will become
            head of Asia Pacific ex-Japan fixed income, commodities and
            currencies distribution, according to a separate memo seen by
            Bloomberg. The contents of both documents were confirmed by
            Connie Ling, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kavvathas joined Goldman Sachs in 2001 on the interest rate
            hedge fund sales desk in London and in 2008 became co-head of
            Europe, Middle East and Africa credit flow sales. He took over
            equity derivatives and credit distribution across Asia when he
            moved to Hong Kong in 2009, according to the memo. He was named
            managing director in 2005 and partner in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Houghton moved to Hong Kong at the end of last year and
            became head of Asia Pacific ex-Japan macro sales. He previously
            led hedge fund coverage for interest-rate products in the
            Americas, according to the second memo. He was named managing
            director in 2005 and partner in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
            largest U.S. bank by assets, will begin disclosing the daily net
            asset value for its U.S. commercial paper money-market funds as
            regulators are debating an overhaul that would make the vehicles
            safer for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management expects to expand the daily
            disclosure next week to money funds that invest in municipal and
            government debt, the New York-based company said today in a
            statement. The values of the funds as of 3 p.m. will be
            disclosed the following day, Goldman Sachs said in an investor
            update on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a leading provider of liquidity solutions, we believe
            that more frequent disclosure and greater transparency will
            benefit investors,' Goldman Sachs said in the statement. 'This
            will have no impact to how fund shareholders transact or the way
            the funds are managed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators led by former U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro have worked to impose tighter
            restrictions on money funds since the September 2008 collapse of
            the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund. Proposals to make the
            funds stronger have included abandoning the $1 fixed share
            price, an idea that providers have said would destroy the appeal
            of money-market funds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Israel Said to Hire Goldman, Barclays to Lead Euro Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Israel is considering selling its
            first euro-denominated bonds since 2010, following Poland,
            Slovakia and Ireland in taking advantage of historically low
            yields as the Federal Reserve begins tapering stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government hired Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to arrange the transaction, according
            to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be
            identified because the information isn't public. The sale may
            take place in the next few weeks, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nations are being drawn by low yields before the Fed
            further reduces its $85 billion monthly bond-purchase program
            after deciding to trim its buying by $10 billion at its most
            recent meeting Dec. 18. Israeli two-year yields were 1.25
            percent today compared with a 10-year average of 3.44 percent.
            Poland sold 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) of 2024 bonds
            yesterday, Ireland issued 3.75 billion euros of 10-year bonds
            Jan. 7 and Slovakia is selling 15-year euro securities today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For European-based investors, it has a nice
            diversification element,' Michael J Roche, an emerging-market
            strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said in a telephone interview
            from New York yesterday. 'It has the faster growth of an
            emerging market, offers extra yield and it is an improving
            credit.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Israel's euro-denominated bonds maturing in
            2020 was little changed at 2.06 percent at 5:42 p.m. in Tel
            Aviv. The country sold the debt on March 2010 to yield 4.7
            percent. The yield on the country's euro-denominated bonds due
            in 2015 rose for the first time in six days, advancing one basis
            point, or 0.01 percentage point to 0.91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Israel last tapped international bond markets 12 months
            ago, when it issued $2 billion of 10- and 30-year paper. The
            country is rated A+ by Standard Poor's, the fifth highest
            investment grade, and equivalent A1 by Moody's Investors
            Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shlomi Bidani, a spokesman for Barclays in Israel, and a
            public relations representative for Goldman Sachs who couldn't
            be identified because of company policy, yesterday declined to
            comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Calls made to Citigroup and
            an e-mail sent to the Finance Ministry seeking comment weren't
            returned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate issuers have also been selling Eurobonds, defined
            as securities sold in a currency other than that of the issuer.
            Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil's state-run oil company, issued
            3.1 billion euros of notes Jan. 7 in the company's biggest
            offering in that currency. &lt;/p&gt;

            makes vehicles in China with Daimler AG (DAI) and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380),
            hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) for the Hong

            General Motors Co. (GM)'s $18.1 billion offering in 2010, data

            &lt;p&gt;BAIC would use IPO proceeds to develop its own brand,
            Chairman Xu Heyi said in September. The state-owned company,
            which traces its roots to making sidecar motorcycles used in the
            Korean War, has said it wants to make 'world-class' cars by
            2025 and hired Ferrari designer Leonardo Fioravanti to help
            improve its brand appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IPO may get pushed into 2014 as BAIC restructures the
            car unit, said one of the people. A press official at BAIC said
            he couldn't immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            slowed along with growth in the world's second-largest economy.
            Chinese companies raised $6.4 billion in Hong Kong IPOs last
            year, the smallest amount since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg

        <headline>Goldman's De Mallmann Buys NYC Apartment for $13 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, a
            London-based partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., bought an
            apartment on Manhattan's Park Avenue for $13 million, 13 percent
            less than what its owners initially sought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal for the four-bedroom co-op at 730 Park Ave., near
            71st Street, was completed on Dec. 26, according to New York
            City property records made public today. The apartment was once
            home to Richard Mack, chief executive officer of AREA Property
            Partners LP's North America division. Mack transferred the
            property in 2011 to his wife, Christine, who was listed as the
            seller, property records show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 4,300-square-foot (400-square-meter) property includes
            a library, a staff room and a hallway 'ideal for displaying
            your art collection,' according to the Corcoran Group brokerage
            listing posted on StreetEasy.com. 'An outstanding layout with
            spectacular entertainment space and grand rooms.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal was completed amid a surge in year-end luxury-home
            transactions made before an expected jump in capital-gains taxes
            on Jan. 1. There were more sales of Manhattan luxury property in
            the last three months of 2012 than in any other fourth quarter
            since at least 1989, when New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc.
            began tracking the data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luxury sales, defined as the top 10 percent of transactions
            by price, jumped 29 percent from a year earlier to 260, based on
            data Miller Samuel collected from public records through Dec.
            31. The figures capture 85 percent of all such deals in the
            quarter and will climb higher as purchases completed in the
            final days of last month are reported with the city finance
            department, said Jonathan Miller, the appraiser's president. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Price Cut &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mack declined to comment on the deal. De Mallmann, Goldman
            Sachs's head of investment banking services in Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, didn't return an e-mail. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The apartment de Mallmann purchased was first listed for
            sale in April for $15 million, according to StreetEasy. The
            asking price was reduced to $13.5 million in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;De Mallmann, 42, joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 and became a
            partner in 2004, one year after being named a managing director.
            He was head of the European financing group before taking his
            current job in 2011. He has French and Swiss citizenship,
            according to a Goldman Sachs filing in November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Denies Singapore Stock Dump, Countersues</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit
            denied dumping a Singapore private wealth client's shares it
            held as collateral and said it's still owed money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quah Su Ling sued Goldman Sachs International in London,
            accusing it of breach of contract for selling her shares in
            Blumont Group Ltd., Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. and
            depressing their prices. Goldman Sachs International countersued
            for $12.3 million it says it's still owed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International sold the shares in an 'orderly
            and measured manner -- consistent with industry practice and
            accepted standards -- over the course of three weeks,' the bank
            said in court papers filed in London and made available this
            week. The lawsuit is Quah's 'attempt to delay or avoid
            repayment of debt.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the three Singapore companies tumbled with
            Asiasons falling 62 percent on Oct. 4, while Blumont declined 56
            percent and LionGold was down 42 percent. Over three days from
            Oct. 4, the declines erased $6.9 billion from Singapore's bourse
            value. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the city's stock
            exchange said they would probe activities around the shares of
            the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quah, the Chief Executive Officer of IPCO International
            Ltd., claimed Goldman Sachs demanded she repay $48 million
            within 1 1/2 hours on Oct. 2 and started selling her shares. The
            bank hadn't informed her previously of any shortfall in her
            margin loan or give her reasonable time to make payment, Quah
            said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Quah didn't respond
            to two e-mails or a call to her office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also been sued in London by James Hong,
            an executive director at Blumont. Hong claimed the bank breached
            its duties by 'arbitrarily' selling his shares in the three
            Singapore commodity companies held as collateral, according to
            the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have stepped up oversight of
            capital markets after the global financial crisis in 2008.
            Singapore's central bank established a 13-member council in 2010
            with the goal of boosting corporate governance standards and
            investor confidence. The Singapore Exchange, Southeast Asia's
            biggest bourse, said after the decline of the three stocks it
            plans to add circuit breakers in 2014 to halt trading for 10
            minutes when shares move 10 percent in either direction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Quah Su Ling v Goldman Sachs International.

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Sees 4% Hedge-Fund Returns</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s private-
            wealth-management unit expects hedge funds to return an average
            of 4 percent to 5 percent over the next five years as the
            industry struggles amid low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody hopes to get the five hedge funds, all of whom
            are going to have 15 percent returns,' Sharmin Mossavar- Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs
            Private
            Wealth Management's Investment Strategy Group, said at a press
            briefing today. 'People need to be more realistic.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $2.19 trillion hedge-fund industry last year trailed
            global stocks for the fifth time in seven years, posting a 6.7
            percent gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI
            All-Country World Index (MXWO) returned 17 percent in 2012, and the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) rose 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve officials said last year they will keep
            interest rates near zero as long as the jobless rate is above
            6.5 percent and inflation is forecast to be 2.5 percent or less.
            Previously they said they will keep rates low through at least
            mid-2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mossavar-Rahmani said investors are 'overestimating' how
            much hedge funds can return in excess of market indexes. While
            some managers may do well, the low-interest-rate environment
            makes it difficult to produce double-digit returns, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They don't walk on water,' Mossavar-Rahmani said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equity funds and event-driven funds, those that invest in
            companies undergoing transactions such as mergers or spinoffs,
            may benefit if stock markets rise next year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Tells Jury Dragon Rushed Toward Doomed Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) portrayed speech recognition pioneer Dragon Systems Inc. as rushing
            to close a $580 million deal without sufficiently vetting its buyer in a doomed union that triggered a
            negligence suit and landed the bank in Boston federal court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beginning its defense this
            week, Goldman Sachs made its case to jurors who have spent weeks hearing how the 2000 all- stock deal was
            quickly followed by an accounting scandal that led to the collapse of suitor Lernout Hauspie Speech Products
            NV. Goldman Sachs, which advised Dragon on the deal, called witnesses to counter allegations by Dragon
            founders Jim and Janet Baker that its negligence cost them their life's work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testifying
            Jan. 9 for Goldman Sachs, former Dragon president John Shagoury agreed with a bank attorney that Dragon's
            board of directors was focused on 'speed and certainty' in the months leading to the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Because
            the company's financial situation was getting worse instead of better, and at the same time we felt it was
            creating a huge distraction for the employees, we needed to get something done, or decide how the company
            was going to continue,' Shagoury testified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Do you blame Goldman Sachs that the stock
            options became worthless in the merger?' Goldman Sachs attorney Paul Vizcarrondo asked. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'No,'
            said Shagoury, who became president of Lernout Hauspie Holdings USA when the deal closed, and is now
            president of health care communications technology company Eliza Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gross Negligence
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dragon's founders, who are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, claim
            that four Goldman Sachs bankers assigned to the transaction committed gross negligence by failing to pursue
            questions about Belgium-based Lernout Hauspie's finances that should have led them to avoid the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They alleged in court papers that they lost their company and access to the technology they had
            spent their careers developing, including Dragon NaturallySpeaking dictation software, when Lernout Hauspie
            filed for bankruptcy in November 2000. The deal closed in June of that year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs claimed its team gave Dragon competent advice and said it urged company management to press their
            accountants at Arthur Andersen LLP to probe Lernout Hauspie's finances. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bakers, who
            started Dragon in 1982, claim the bankers failed to do due diligence and never advised them to back away
            from the sale despite lingering questions about LH's unusual revenue spikes in Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Due
            Diligence &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for New York-based Goldman Sachs have argued that due diligence
            wasn't the bank's responsibility under a five-page engagement agreement. Several members of the banking team
            who worked on the deal said in court testimony that Goldman Sachs properly shepherded the transaction to a
            final sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dragon paid Goldman Sachs $5 million for its advice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With
            the sale moving ahead in February 2000, Goldman Sachs sent Dragon an unsigned memo recommending the company
            have Arthur Anderson perform due diligence on Lernout Hauspie, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catherine
            Moy, who worked on the Dragon account for Arthur Anderson, testified Jan. 7 that her firm's work was 'very
            limited' on the deal. She said the accounting firm was never hired to do any of the tasks Goldman Sachs
            described in its Feb. 29 memo to Dragon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Dragon President Shagoury testified that
            he remembered both Dragon's chief financial officer, Ellen Chamberlain, and Goldman Sachs's team wanted
            further due diligence. He said Chamberlain eventually declared it done. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recalls
            Completion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I recall she said the due diligence was completed,' Shagoury told jurors.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chamberlain, who testified Dec. 18, told the jury that Dragon expected Goldman Sachs to
            conduct due diligence. She said no one from the bank ever expressed reservations about moving forward with
            the sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I had a level of expectation of bankers driving a process, making due
            diligence happen, being very active, detailed and that was not the way Goldman Sachs operated,' she said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chamberlain also testified that no one on the Goldman team ever mentioned that the
            bank's own investment division had investigated LH in the late 1990s, under work labeled internally as
            'Project Sermon,' and decided not to invest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a videotaped deposition played for the
            jury Jan. 4, Goldman Sachs analyst Luca Velussi, who worked on Project Sermon, said he couldn't remember
            specific reasons why that project didn't move forward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Abandoned Projects &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We abandon the vast majority of projects,' Velussi said under questioning by the Bakers' attorney,
            Alan Cotler. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;T. Otey Smith, a former member of the Goldman Sachs team who worked on the
            Dragon deal, testified in a taped deposition that the team's leader, Richard Wayner, didn't press the issue
            that there were unanswered questions about the merger when Dragon's board of directors met and voted to
            approved it in March 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wayner testified last month that Goldman Sachs had unanswered
            questions about Lernout Hauspie's suspicious surges in sales in Asia -- revenue that turned out to be
            fictitious -- but never sought to stop Dragon from selling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wayner told the jury that,
            after informing Dragon that Goldman Sachs didn't receive satisfactory answers from LH, it was 'the client's
            decision whether or not they want to do the deal.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Inadequate Standards &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A former investment banker testifying on behalf of Dragon this week told jurors Goldman Sachs's
            team 'didn't provide the level of standards Goldman sets for itself,' nor did it meet industry standards.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Their failure to do that gave the folks at the March 27 meeting a flawed and inaccurate
            picture of what a merger with LH would actually look like,' said Donna Hitscherich, a former investment
            banker with JPMorgan Chase Co. who now lectures at Columbia Business School, referring to the board meeting.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said she spent more than 700 hours reviewing records from the case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I
            was shocked,' she said. 'It was grossly subpar and inadequate for the type of engagement they were assigned
            to.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said she would have expected Goldman Sachs to take additional action after
            sending Dragon the February 2000 memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In my mind, that's a showstopper,' Hitscherich
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next Week &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testimony in the case, presided over by U.S.
            District Judge Patti Saris, is scheduled to resume Jan. 14. Goldman Sachs Vice President Chris Fine, who was
            chief technology strategist for the bank's high-tech group during the Dragon sale, is to return to the
            witness stand. Goldman Sachs also said that it plans to call Wayner to testify again. Closing arguments are
            expected to begin at the end of next week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 9, Fine testified the Goldman Sachs
            team working on the deal developed a list of questions that needed answers in the months prior to the sale,
            and advised Dragon to obtain an accounting firm with knowledge of accounting regulations in Belgium. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Did Dragon follow up on the recommendation to do more due diligence?' a Goldman Sachs's lawyer
            asked Fine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Not that I recall,' he responded. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another case against
            New York-based Goldman Sachs filed by Paul G. Bamberg and Robert Roth, two other Dragon founders who held
            minority shares in the company, is being heard at the same time before Saris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lernout's
            Collapse &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lernout Hauspie
            created bogus customers, booked circular transactions with shell companies and recorded loans as sales from
            1996 to 2000. The company was forced to restate $373 million in earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The suit
            against Goldman Sachs was put on hold by agreement of both sides for years while the Bakers sued other
            participants and advisers in the deal. They've reached a total of about $70 million in settlements, their
            lawyer, Cotler, has told Saris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the value of Dragon at the time of the sale,
            the Bakers' lost as much as $288.8 million in the deal and its aftermath, they said in court papers. Bamberg
            and Roth have said they lost as much as $50 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In court filings, Goldman Sachs
            said the plaintiffs' damages are less than the amount they've already recovered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan.
            2, Bamberg, now a senior lecturer on mathematics at Harvard University, testified he initially opposed the
            merger and was shocked when the deal became an all-stock offering. In one conversation with Dragon board
            members, he said he compared partnering with Lernout Hauspie to joining the Serbian Army. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bamberg
            said the Goldman Sachs team never raised any concerns about the deal at the board of directors meeting. He
            said he would have rejected the sale if they had. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Anything significant I would have
            said I'm not signing until we get more information about this,' Bamberg said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case
            is Baker v. Goldman Sachs Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman 10% Return Tied to CEO Pay Too Low for Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investors want a target for annual returns -- as long as it's higher
            than the one that pays a bonus to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and his top deputies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the New York-based firm set to report a fourth straight year of lower profitability than it
            had in the decade before the financial crisis, shareholders are waiting for Goldman Sachs to end its status
            as the only major investment bank that won't declare a public profitability target. The company's board of
            directors set a 10 percent return-on-equity target for top executives to earn their long-term bonuses, a
            level that even Blankfein has called 'hardly aspirational.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the lack of a target
            hasn't prevented Goldman Sachs's stock from almost doubling in the past two years, executives have been
            asked for a goal by analysts and investors during six of the last seven earnings calls and conference
            presentations. The most recent request came after third-quarter trading revenue dropped the most among the
            nine largest global investment banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It does come up a lot with investors, how long do
            they have?' said Roger Freeman, a Barclays Plc (BARC) analyst in New York. 'It's a question of time --
            whether the environment for dealers gets better fast enough to avoid being in a difficult position of having
            to put a target out there that's meaningfully higher than where they're at.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Opposes ACA Bid to Add Paulson to CDO Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accused ACA
            Financial Guaranty Corp. (MANF) of withholding thousands of audio
            recordings the investment bank wants in its fight against a
            lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs asked a New York state judge in court papers
            Jan. 11 to order bond insurer ACA to produce the recordings,
            pointing to one phone call that it says 'utterly eviscerates'
            ACA's claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'ACA's unjustified withholding of the additional
            recordings impedes Goldman Sachs' ability to challenge, and the
            court's ability to examine,' the claims in the case, the New
            York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's bid for the recordings comes after ACA
            sought court permission to file a revised complaint that adds
            hedge fund Paulson Co. as a defendant. ACA claims Goldman
            Sachs and Paulson conspired to induce it to provide financial
            guaranty insurance for Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA claims it was deceived into believing that Paulson was
            a long investor in the deal when the hedge fund was in fact
            betting against it. Goldman Sachs agreed to a $550 million
            settlement in 2010 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission to resolve claims that it misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Doomsday' Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its filing, Goldman Sachs quotes from a May 2007 call
            between an ACA portfolio manager and a bond trader at Morgan
            Stanley in which ACA is told Paulson was pursuing a 'doomsday'
            strategy and betting against the mortgage market. The recording
            'demonstrates unequivocally' that ACA actually knew of
            Paulson's shorting strategy, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for New York-based ACA, said in
            an interview that the call wasn't about Abacus and was instead
            'anecdotal market chatter' about Paulson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA, which is seeking to recover $120 million in damages,
            cites in its complaint a recording in which a Goldman Sachs
            managing director told ACA that Paulson was a '100 percent
            equity' investor in the deal. ACA has produced 6,900 recordings
            to Goldman Sachs and will turn over more as they become
            available, Kasowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs's specific misrepresentation to ACA about
            Paulson's '100 percent equity' interest in Abacus trumps any
            anecdotal market 'color' by a third party,' Kasowitz said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. v. Goldman Sachs
            Co., 650027-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Is Said to Refrain From Delaying U.K. Bonus Payouts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won't delay
            distribution of U.K. bonuses to help minimize employees' tax
            rates, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm had considered postponing incentive compensation
            due to employees from 2009, 2010 and 2011 until after top
            income-tax rates drop in April. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said today it's 'depressing' that banks
            may be willing to
            shift bonus payments to minimize workers' tax burden. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Treasury minister Sajid Javid spoke with Goldman Sachs
            representatives today, according to a person with knowledge of
            the discussion. They gave assurances that bonuses would be paid
            in the normal way and that there would be no changes to the
            schedule. The call was set up yesterday, said the person, who
            requested anonymity because the discussion was private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs accelerated delivery of $65 million in stock
            awards last month to 10 executives, including Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, in a move that helped them avoid
            higher U.S. taxes that take effect this year. That change, which
            didn't affect compensation for 2012, was made public in company
            filings at about 8 p.m. New York time on Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This week, the Financial Times and other media reported
            that New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank
            by assets, was reviewing whether to delay U.K. bonus payments
            due from prior years to help employees pay lower rates. The
            reports were met with criticism from U.K. politicians and King. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Management opted against proceeding with the plan, a
            decision that was ratified today in a regular meeting of the
            board's compensation committee, said the person with knowledge
            of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;British Broadcasting Corp. editor Robert Peston reported
            Goldman Sachs's decision earlier today on Twitter.com. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Morgan Stanley Set $557 Million Fed Mortgage Accord</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) agreed to offer a $557 million package of
            cash and other assistance for mortgage borrowers to settle a federal probe into allegations that the banks
            improperly seized homes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sum includes $232 million in direct payments to more than
            220,000 borrowers and $325 million in assistance such as loan modifications, the Federal Reserve said in a
            statement. Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman, declined to say how much each of the New York-based firms will pay.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal adds to the $8.5 billion settlement announced last week among the Fed, the
            Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 10 of the biggest U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Co.
            (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. Regulators probed allegations that lenders rushed home
            foreclosures by using flawed documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'With the addition of Goldman Sachs and Morgan
            Stanley, more than 4 million borrowers will receive a total of $3.5 billion in cash compensation while an
            additional $5.5 billion will be provided by the servicers for mortgage assistance,' the Fed said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's share of the accord totals $227 million, consisting of $97
            million in cash and $130 million in other relief, according to two people briefed on the matter. Goldman
            Sachs will pay $135 million in cash plus $195 million in relief, said the people, who asked for anonymity
            because terms weren't publicly announced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Helping Borrowers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cash
            payments in today's deal range as high as $125,000 and cover borrowers whose homes were in foreclosure in
            2009 and 2010, the Fed said. The loans were handled by Litton Loan Servicing LP, which formerly was owned by
            Goldman Sachs, and Saxon Mortgage Services Inc., which was a unit of Morgan Stanley, according to the Fed.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Lake of Morgan Stanley both
            said their firms were pleased to have resolved the probe. Lake declined to say whether the accord will
            result in a charge against fourth-quarter earnings, which are scheduled to be released Jan. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set aside $260 million in the fourth quarter to cover litigation and regulatory
            proceedings including today's settlement, according to a statement today released with the firm's earnings.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Longer List &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bought Litton in 2007 to get into
            mortgage servicing, and Morgan Stanley bought Saxon in 2006, before a housing market collapse that led to
            the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Litton started 135,586 foreclosures in 2009 and 2010,
            and Saxon initiated at least 60,313 actions in the same period, according to the Fed. Both banks later sold
            the servicers to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The settlement with Goldman Sachs and
            Morgan Stanley expands the industry payouts beyond the initial 14 firms that agreed in 2011 to hire outside
            consultants to review their foreclosures for errors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Inc. (HBC) and Ally
            Financial Inc. (ALLY) are also preparing to sign on to the deal, two people briefed on the matter have said.
            Neil Brazil, a U.S. spokesman for HSBC, said the bank is still in discussions with regulators. Its mortgage-
            servicing operations were regulated by both the Fed and OCC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The OCC continues
            conversations with the remaining servicers,' said Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IndyMac
            Bancorp's successor OneWest Bank FSB and EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER) also haven't reached an accord with
            regulators. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ally, with all its mortgage-servicing affiliates, represented the
            fifth-largest U.S. servicer with 2.5 million loans during the crisis, according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Residential
            Capital LLC, the unit of Detroit-based Ally involved in the settlement, supports the idea that bank funds
            'should go toward consumers rather than consultants,' and has been delayed in considering the settlement
            because of its bankruptcy, said Susan Fitzpatrick, a bank spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Profit Beats Analysts' Estimates on Investments</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) climbed the most in 10 months after quarterly profit beat estimates
            and full-year revenue grew for the first time since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 4.1 percent to
            $141.09 at 4:09 p.m. in New York, the biggest gain since March 13, pushing the year-to-date increase to 11
            percent. The firm said fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $5.60 a share, surpassing even the
            highest estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
            Blankfein, 58, who has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-2011, cut 900 jobs
            during the year and slashed the portion of revenue allocated to pay. A stock-market rebound and a $500
            million profit from selling a hedge fund-administration unit helped revenue recover from the lowest first
            half since 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is a very cyclical business, highly dependent on capital
            markets,' said Michael Vogelzang, chief investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4
            billion, including Goldman Sachs stock. 'The capital markets were doing well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Return on
            average common stockholders' equity, a measure of how well the firm reinvests shareholder money, rose to
            10.7 percent in 2012 from 3.7 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s compensation expense climbed 6 percent in 2012, the first increase
            in three years, as revenue rose 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expense, which includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and deferred awards from previous years, advanced to $12.9 billion for the year from $12.2
            billion in 2011, the New York-based company said today in a statement. The cost amounted to 38 percent of
            revenue, compared with 42 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, has sought to lower annual costs by $1.9 billion since mid-2011 as the
            fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets contended with slumping revenue. The pay increase for 2012 contrasts with
            a 3 percent decline in the number of employees to 32,400 during the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pay
            expense averages $399,506 per employee, up from $367,057 in 2011. The average compensation figures are
            derived by dividing the compensation pool by the number of employees and don't reflect actual pay for

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Discloses $1.1 Billion of 2012 Reinsurance Revenue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generates the most revenue from equity trading of any bank in
            the world, said $1.08 billion of that revenue comes from its
            reinsurance business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit produced $880 million of revenue in 2011, Goldman
            Sachs said today as it disclosed the contribution for the first
            time in its fourth-quarter earnings report. Reinsurance revenue
            accounted for 13 percent of the bank's $8.21 billion of 2012
            equities revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is in talks to sell a majority stake in its
            reinsurance business in a deal that would value the unit at
            about $1.1 billion, The Insurance Insider reported yesterday.
            David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined
            to comment on the potential sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group has a global property and
            casualty reinsurance business as well as a life and annuity
            reinsurance operations primarily in the U.S. The bank agreed to
            in March to buy Ariel Holdings Ltd.'s Bermuda-based insurance
            and reinsurance businesses to expand property and casualty
            coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Increased reserves in the reinsurance unit added to non-
            compensation expenses, the firm said today without providing
            figures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' equities division generated about $2 billion

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Mulls Selling Stake in Reinsurance Business</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it's
            weighing whether to sell a stake in its reinsurance unit, which
            generated $1.08 billion of revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business may be 'better held in other people's hands
            and we can be a minority owner' after global capital rules take
            effect, Harvey M. Schwartz, who is set to become chief financial
            officer this month, said today on a conference call after New
            York-based Goldman Sachs reported fourth-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It was the first time the bank disclosed the contribution
            of its Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group. Reinsurance revenue
            climbed 23 percent last year from 2011 and accounted for 13
            percent of the firm's $8.21 billion of equities revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is in talks to sell a majority stake in the
            business in a deal that would value the unit at about $1.1
            billion, Insurance Insider reported yesterday. David Wells, a
            company spokesman, declined to comment on the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
            business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
            primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in March to buy Ariel
            Holdings Ltd.'s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
            businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Increased reserves in the reinsurance unit added to non-
            compensation expenses, the firm said today without providing
            figures. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Increase Pay for Some Staff on Cap</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
            to increase fixed pay for some senior staff and traders in
            Europe as regulators prepare to limit bonuses in the region,
            according to a person with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank plans to make so-called role-based payments to
            some senior bankers and traders in addition to their annual
            salaries and bonuses, said the person, who asked not to be
            identified because the plans haven't been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are seeking ways to sidestep tougher European Union
            bonus rules, which will apply for the first time to awards given
            in 2015, based on this year's performance. Regulators are
            preparing to outlaw bonuses that are more than twice fixed pay
            in what lawmakers called irresponsible risk-taking that helped
            spark the 2008 global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders will be able to ask national regulators to exempt
            staff earning as much as 1 million euros ($1.4 million), the
            European Banking Authority said on Dec. 13. The EBA would have
            to approve any such waiver, while senior managers aren't
            eligible for the exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Britain was home to 2,188 investment bankers earning more
            than 1 million euros in 2012, the highest amount in the EU,
            while Spain had 37, according to the London-based EBA. France
            and Germany had 117 and 100 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that fourth-quarter fixed-income,
            currency and commodities trading revenue was $1.72 billion, down
            15 percent from a year earlier. Revenue from the equities
            division dropped 27 percent to $1.68 billion from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sky News reported the news earlier today. David Wells, a
            spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) fell the most in two months after the firm, which relies more on
            trading than any of its competitors, said revenue from that business dropped 13 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading generated $15.7 billion in 2013, or about 46 percent of the firm's total, according to a
            statement today from New York-based Goldman Sachs. That was the lowest percentage since 2002. Fourth-quarter
            net income dropped 19 percent, to $2.33 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
            Blankfein, 59, reported a fourth straight year of lower profitability than the firm achieved in the decade
            before the financial crisis. Goldman Sachs's return on equity, a gauge of profitability, was 11 percent last
            year, and the company has struggled to reach 10 percent in the past three years, a level Blankfein has
            called 'hardly aspirational.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            Goldman Sachs Cuts Pay Ratio to 2nd-Lowest as Public Firm
            &lt;p&gt;Last year's profit 'serves as a reminder that the glory days of posting 20 percent-plus ROE is a
            distant memory,' said Euan Sanderson, a money manager at Standard Life Investments, which has more than $270
            billion in assets under management. 'Higher capital levels and regulatory constraints make it more
            challenging for Goldman to be Goldman.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company fell 2 percent to $175.17
            at 4:15 p.m., the biggest decline since Nov. 7. While the shares have doubled since December 2011, they are
            still below their pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut the portion of revenue it
            pays employees to the second-lowest level as a public firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation for 2013, which
            includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, fell 2.6
            percent from 2012 to $12.6 billion, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in the
            same period was little changed at $34.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
            Blankfein, 59, allocated 37 percent of revenue for pay in 2013, compared with 38 percent the previous year.
            While the average ratio has dropped by more than 6 percentage points since 2008, compared with the five
            years before the financial crisis, Blankfein has said he's wary of cutting too much and losing top
            performers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's always a war for talent,' Blankfein said at an investor conference
            in November. 'We're always under pressure for good people. I would say this isn't the most intense period of
            that war that we've ever experienced, but it's always there and we're always conscious of it.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reported the highest annual earnings in three years as underwriting
            revenue surged to a record and the firm's reliance on trading fell to the lowest level in more than a
            decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed 8 percent in 2013 to $8.04 billion, the New York-based
            company said today in a statement. In the fourth-quarter, profit dropped 19 percent to $2.33 billion, or
            $4.60 a share, from $2.89 billion, or $5.60, a year earlier. That surpassed the $4.18 average estimate of 25

        <headline>Goldman Leading Renewable Offerings Says Slump Is Ending</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top arranger for renewable-energy stock offerings last year, is
            accelerating its funding efforts as it anticipates a rebound in an industry that's slumped every year since
            2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman overtook Morgan Stanley as the biggest lead manager for share offerings
            with three deals valued at $405.6 million, according to an annual ranking by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment bank is backing renewable energy that it expects will gain favor in a
            global shift it says is inevitable. That's why short-term volatility will be trumped by long-term gains as
            emerging technologies first become commonplace and then become indispensable, according to Stuart Bernstein,
            the Goldman partner overseeing its renewables unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It feels like the worst is behind
            us,' Bernstein, 49, said in an interview from his office in San Francisco. 'I'm a contrarian, so when
            everyone else is capitulating, I think it's time to invest.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            Global Clean-Energy Investment Fell 11% in 2012
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman may boost its financing efforts this year as it seeks to meet a pledge made in May to
            invest and finance more than $40 billion in the industry in the next decade. Worldwide, more than $395
            billion will be invested annually in renewable energy by 2020, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has
            made equity investments in solar developer BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) and Horizon Wind Energy, which it
            sold to EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Goldman's Deals &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            September, Goldman underwrote a $225 million follow-on offering for the electric-car company Tesla Motors
            Ltd. (TSLA), along with IPOs for the rooftop photovoltaic developer SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) in December and
            the biofuel crop developer Ceres Inc. (CERE) in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Backing renewable
            energy isn't just an investment strategy, it's a necessity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is so
            important that when Goldman's top executives visit the West Coast, up to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
            Blankfein, 'they don't just visit our largest market-cap clients, they also spend time with our early stage
            clean-tech companies,' Bernstein said. Clean energy is 'central to the Goldman Sachs franchise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index (NEX), known as the NEX, slumped 5.5 percent last
            year, adding to 40 percent and 15 percent declines in the two previous years as investors pared their
            appetite for risk and governments slashed incentives for the industry. The Bloomberg Industries Large Solar
            Energy (BISOLAR) index of 17 companies fell 26 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Renewable Rebound
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable shares have rebounded in the past few months as risk appetite returned. The
            NEX, which tracks 94 clean-energy stocks, has climbed more than 20 percent since Nov. 16, and the Large
            Solar index surged 81 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The market appears to have toughed in the fourth quarter
            of last year and several sectors have rallied meaningfully since then,' Bernstein said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His
            comments coincide with a deal in the U.S. to extend a tax credit that supports wind-turbine installations.
            The policy was due to expire Dec. 31 and lobbying efforts to renew it received a boost after President
            Barack Obama's re-election. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solar industry is also gaining, with the first
            consecutive monthly increases in polysilicon prices since January 2012. Polysilicon, the raw material in
            most solar panels, has risen 1.3 percent since Dec. 24 to $16.03 a kilogram on Jan. 7, according to data
            from New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman has been investing in renewable energy since at least
            2005, and has a long-term view, said Ethan Zindler, an analyst with New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Credibility'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They have considerable credibility within this sector,' he said in by e-mail. 'They
            have seen the various ups and downs, so they have significant perspective as well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            last took the top position in 2010, losing the slot to Morgan Stanley (MS) both in 2011 and in 2009. Morgan
            Stanley and UBS AG (UBSN) were co-lead managers on China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916)'s $375 million
            stock offering in December, the biggest fund-raising in the public markets in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"This
            is going to be an extraordinarily large emerging market much the same way we viewed the BRICs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            deals by Goldman last year trumped the $363.8 million managed by Shanghai-based Guotai Junan Securities Co.
            Ltd., according to data compiled by New Energy Finance, a Bloomberg research company. The Chinese company
            handled the secondary stock placement of power-generator Shanghai Aerospace Automobile Electromechanical Co.
            (600151) and Shenzhen Jiawei Photovoltaic Lighting Co. (300317)'s IPO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tesla, based in
            Palo Alto, California, has more than doubled since its June 2010 IPO, and its shares are up 49 percent in
            the past year. SolarCity has gained 77 percent since trading began. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Bring Investors'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The success of SolarCity's IPO may bring investors back to the markets and create
            future financing and MA opportunities,' Bernstein said. 'There will be interesting IPOs in several sectors
            over the next few years.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernstein, a Goldman partner, has also worked in private
            equity and is on the selection committee for the company's clean technology and renewables group. He spends
            most of his time at Goldman's office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California, famous for its venture
            capital culture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment bank created Bernstein's unit about three years ago to
            focus exclusively on renewable energy and take advantage of what it saw as a promising long-term play, he
            said. He compared the industry to the technology market in the 1990s, which was once seen as fraught with
            risky new technologies that are now the backbone of the information age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We have a
            growing global population coupled with an increasing per capita consumption of energy, while fossil
            resources are finite and shrinking,' he said. Backing renewable energy isn't just an investment strategy,
            it's a necessity, he said. 'How can one not consider clean energy and renewable alternatives?' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Purge of Madoff, Goldman Probe Files Upheld by Judge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission doesn't have to restore purged files on Bernard Madoff and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) that
            were sought by a
            government watchdog group, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued
            the agency for allegedly violating federal records law by
            refusing to recover investigative files that had been destroyed.
            The group asked for documents related to the agency's
            preliminary probes under the Freedom of Information Act. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ruled
            today that the government was only required to seek recovery of
            records that were physically removed from the agency's custody
            rather than those that were done away with. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The SEC was under no duty to undertake restoration
            efforts,' the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit sought records of so-called Matters Under
            Investigation, which under a policy dating back to 1998 weren't
            stored as official files of the SEC, according to a Sept. 14,
            2011, letter to Congress from then-SEC enforcement director
            Robert Khuzami. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CREW, as the group is known, sued for materials related to
            the SEC's initial probes of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, Goldman
            Sachs's trades of American International Group Inc. credit-
            default swaps in 2009, insider-trading probes of Deutsche Bank
            AG, Lehman Brothers and SAC Capital Advisors LP, and
            investigations of possible financial fraud at Wells Fargo Co.
            and Bank of America Corp. in 2007 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Early Stages &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group, according to the lawsuit, wanted to know why
            those probes were closed at an early stage without any action by
            the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Darcy Flynn, a 13-year SEC employee, claimed in a letter to
            U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, that the
            agency destroyed documents related to those investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The most troubling aspect of the judge's opinion is his
            conclusion that the SEC is under absolutely no obligation to
            conduct any recovery efforts,' Anne Weismann, chief counsel of
            the group, said. She said the group was considering whether to
            appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group sought recovery of deleted electronic files as
            well as any physical documents that may still exist elsewhere in
            the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Messy Details' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the group filed its lawsuit, Weismann said in a
            statement that 'the public deserves to know all the messy
            details about how these investigations were conducted, and why
            they were closed at such an early stage without taking any
            action against the Bernie Madoffs of the world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the SEC's policy on closed preliminary
            investigations, the only information it retained was the title
            of the matter, its source, general subject matter, the staff
            members involved, the date it was opened and closed and other
            parties related to the inquiry, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In light of Grassley's questions and continuing discussions
            with the National Archives and Records Administration, the SEC
            halted the policy, requiring all documents created or received
            for all enforcement matters to be retained until the agency is
            certain that the policies meet federal standards, according to
            Khuzami's letter to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
            Washington v. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 11-cv-
            01732, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Keeping Lid on Pay Amid Rebound Cheers Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
            securities firm that set a Wall Street compensation record in
            2007, is now demonstrating how little it can pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The portion of revenue allotted for salaries, bonuses,
            stock awards and benefits was 38 percent in 2012, down from 42
            percent a year earlier and the lowest since 2009, the company
            said yesterday in a statement. The move helped the bank post a
            fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates and pushed
            return on equity to 10.7 percent for the year, up from 3.7
            percent in 2011. The stock climbed the most in 10 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a better time to be an investor than when bonuses
            are becoming ridiculous,' said Michael Vogelzang, chief
            investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4
            billion including Goldman Sachs shares. 'You're seeing a
            massive amount of overcapacity in the business and it's
            continuing to push down the price of labor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs still may be one of few Wall Street firms
            that pay employees more for 2012 because revenue surged 19
            percent and it cut staff by 3 percent. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the
            biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut total compensation expense at
            its corporate and investment bank 3 percent last year as revenue
            at that division rose 1 percent. The pay expense was 33 percent
            of revenue for the year, down from 34 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Operating Leverage' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which is eliminating 1,600 jobs, will defer
            100 percent of bonuses for some senior bankers and traders over
            three years as it reins in costs, a person briefed on the matter
            said earlier this week. Deutsche Bank AG is weighing 2012 bonus
            cuts of as much as 20 percent for investment bankers in Europe,
            while those in New York will see smaller declines, four people
            briefed on the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anton Schutz, president of Rochester, New York-based Mendon
            Capital Advisors, said control of expenses, which rose 1 percent
            during 2012 even as revenue climbed 19 percent, is something
            Goldman Sachs investors have craved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the things we've been looking for in this space
            for a long time is operating leverage,' said Schutz, whose firm
            has about $150 million under management including Goldman Sachs
            stock. 'That's exciting for shareholders. I don't think it's so
            good for employees unless they own a lot of stock.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 1.7 percent to $143.50 by 10:52
            a.m. in German trading after climbing 4.1 percent yesterday in
            New York to $141.09, the biggest advance since March. The shares
            have gained 11 percent this year on top of a 41 percent advance
            in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank derived about 70 percent of its revenue last year
            from investments with the firm's own money or trading with
            clients. The performance of those businesses is often tied to
            the rise or fall of asset prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A stock-market rebound and a $500 million profit from
            selling a hedge-fund-administration unit helped revenue recover
            from the lowest first half since 2005 as the company booked its
            first annual revenue gain in three years. Revenue in Investing
            Lending, the segment that includes the firm's stakes in stocks,
            bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds, almost
            tripled last year to $5.89 billion from $2.14 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy
            Investment Group LLC, said he raised his estimates for Goldman
            Sachs's earnings per share through 2015 because he expects the
            annual compensation ratio to hold below 40 percent. He kept a
            neutral rating on the stock because he expects gains from
            private-equity and debt holdings to be lower this year and
            predicts regulations will limit trading revenue, according to a
            research note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reinsurance Business &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday that $1.08 billion of the
            firm's $8.2 billion of equity trading revenue was from the
            bank's reinsurance business, marking the first time that the
            company disclosed revenue from that segment. The firm is
            considering selling a majority stake in that unit, said Harvey M. Schwartz, who will replace Chief Financial
            Officer David A. Viniar, 57, at the end of this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank still doesn't have enough information on proposed
            regulatory changes to give a target for future return on equity,
            Schwartz, 48, said on a conference call with investors. The 10.7
            percent figure for 2012 was 'not particularly aspirational,'
            he said. 'We'd like to do better.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central bank policies have boosted asset prices, and that's
            likely to continue to contribute to higher profits at firms like
            Goldman Sachs, said Boston Advisors' Vogelzang. He said he
            expects the bank's return on equity to reach the 'mid-teens.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The way we view the ROE target is this is a very cyclical
            business, highly dependent on capital markets,' Vogelzang said.
            'Our outlook for particularly the U.S. equity markets is quite
            strong, and they're going to be levered to that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Better Balance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has
            undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-
            2011. That helped reduce the compensation ratio, which was part
            of an effort to strike a better balance between rewarding
            employees and shareholders, Schwartz told analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This year we hope we got the balance right,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank employed 32,400 people as of Dec. 31, 900 fewer
            than the end of 2011. It allocated $12.9 billion for
            compensation, up from $12.2 billion in 2011. That averages
            $399,506 per employee. While that's up from $367,057 in 2011,
            it's 40 percent less than the $661,490 average for 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's a reflection of how much the market has changed,
            Vogelzang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very interesting case study in the supply-demand
            equation for high wage-earning, white-collar workers,' he said.
            'We've certainly seen it in manufacturing, we've seen it in
            lower-level services, but we're now seeing it at places like
            Goldman and Morgan Stanley. (MS)' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MFP's Price Says He Wouldn't Buy Goldman Sachs Shares</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MFP Investors LLC's Michael Price
            said he wouldn't add to his holdings in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            at the current price because the fifth-largest U.S. bank by
            assets is trading at fair value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't buy it here,' Price, said in a 'Bloomberg
            Surveillance' television interview with Tom Keene and Sara Eisen today. 'It's fair value.' He said, 'You buy
            things when
            people are selling and you sell when the sun is shining.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Price, who made his reputation as a value investor in the
            1980s by buying shares of beaten-down lenders, owned a $4.5
            million stake in Goldman Sachs, according to a September
            regulatory filing. The New York-based firm rallied 4.1 percent
            yesterday, the most in 10 months, after reporting quarterly
            profit that beat analysts' estimates and full-year revenue grew
            for the first time since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares are trading at about 10 times earnings
            and 1 times book value, Price said. The bank reported yesterday
            that fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $5.60 a share,
            surpassing even the highest estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're the smartest guys in the room,' Price said.
            'When you're looking at financials -- banks, brokers, insurance
            companies -- who's going to be smarter than Goldman? And you
            don't want to pay more than one times book and 10 times
            earnings. That to me is the center point.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dell LBO &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Price doesn't own shares of Dell Inc. (DELL), he said the
            chances of a leveraged buyout for the personal-computer maker
            are greater than 50 percent. The company is in discussions with
            private-equity firms including Silver Lake Management LLC,
            Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A tender offer for the company could be about $14 to $15 a
            share, Price said. Dell shares have surged 16 percent to $12.61
            this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is the time to do it,' Price said on Dell's
            potential buyout. Hewlett-Packard Co.'s 'probably too big to
            do. Dell is big, but not too big, to do,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Price said he owns shares of Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-
            biggest U.S. bank, and foreign-exchange broker FXCM Inc. He is
            also bullish on McGraw-Hill Cos., the educational publisher and
            financial services provider that is planning on splitting its
            two businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to Raise Up to $1.9 Billion in German Property IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG, the apartment
            landlord owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), plans to raise as
            much as 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in an initial public
            offering poised to be the largest by a German property company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG will sell as many as 30.5 million shares for 41 euros
            to 47 euros each, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a
            statement today. That's 57.5 percent of LEG's shares. The stock
            will begin trading in Frankfurt on Feb. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which bought the company for about 3.5
            billion euros including debt in 2008, is seeking to profit from
            a boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit
            index of German property stocks has gained 38 percent in the
            past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An investment in LEG shares offers the opportunity to
            invest in a large pure-play residential property company with
            high growth,' LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in
            the statement. 'In order to achieve future growth, we
            constantly screen the market for potential acquisitions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
            Germany's most populous state. Goldman Sachs' Whitehall Street
            Real Estate fund holds about 95 percent of the company. Perry
            Capital owns the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer period for the IPO will run from Jan. 21 to Jan.
            31. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Guy Hands &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Annington Immobilien AG, Germany's largest owner
            of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington,
            controlled by Guy Hands' Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., has
            about 186,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the share sale, LEG will be Germany's second-largest
            publicly traded residential landlord by properties with 91,000
            apartments. The biggest is Gagfah SA (GFJ), controlled by Fortress
            Investment Group LLC (FIG), which has about 145,000 apartments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG's profit from its main business of renting apartments
            was 243 million euros in 2011 and its funds from operations were
            111.8 million euros, according to its last annual report. FFO
            measures a property company's ability to generate cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By comparison, Gagfah generated a rental profit of 419.6
            million euros in 2011 and its FFO was 159.5 million euros,
            according to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Active Investor &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
            in the German real estate market. In April 2011, Whitehall
            Street and Cerberus Capital Management LP raised 468 million
            euros in an IPO of Berlin-based residential landlord GSW
            Immobilien AG. (GIB) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whitehall Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy
            Baubecon, the residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC)
            agreed to sell to Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) in May in a deal valued at
            1.24 billion euros. Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in
            17 German department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the
            country's largest, in December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Bid to Halt Singapore Investor's Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit won
            a bid to halt Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong's lawsuit over trading losses on the
            Brazilian real in
            favor of private arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling was made in a closed hearing today at
            Singapore's High Court. Oei's lawyer Siraj Omar said he planned
            to appeal the decision. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
            spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei sued Goldman Sachs International in Singapore and the
            parent company in New York, alleging the bank misled him into
            trading real-yen options. He sought at least $31 million in
            damages in each lawsuit. The bank has rejected allegations that
            it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter it
            wrote to Oei in July and filed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei said he relied on the bank's advice that the real was a
            stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar before
            betting in May the yen would fall against the Brazilian
            currency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real has fallen 12 percent since May 15 against the
            yen, the second-worst performer among 16 major currencies
            tracked by Bloomberg, after the South African rand. The real has
            declined three straight years as widening budget deficits

            that trust.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Names Equities Head Chavez to Management Committee</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
            that generates the most revenue from equity trading worldwide,
            named R. Martin Chavez, one of the leaders of that business, to
            its management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman announced Chavez's appointment in an internal memo
            from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President
            Gary D. Cohn that was obtained by Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm,
            confirmed the
            contents of the memo. Chavez runs the equity-trading business
            with Michael D. Daffey and Paul M. Russo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chavez, 48, is a director of the International Swaps and
            Derivatives Association and oversees Goldman Sachs's principal
            strategic investments group, which invests in exchanges and
            other trading facilities. He has co-founded technology companies
            Quorum Software Systems and Kiodex, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Marty's previous work in the technology industry, his
            cross-divisional experience and his deep insight into regulatory
            reform, market structure and operational infrastructure will add
            a unique perspective to the management committee,' Blankfein
            and Cohn wrote in the memo. 'This will be particularly valuable
            as our sales and trading businesses, and the ways in which our
            clients transact, continue to evolve.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $8.2 billion of revenue from equity
            trading, almost $3 billion more than its closest U.S.
            competitor, Morgan Stanley. Goldman disclosed last week that
            $1.08 billion of that revenue came from its reinsurance
            business, which it is considering selling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The management committee will remain at 30 members once
            David Viniar, the firm's chief financial officer until the end
            of this month, departs and joins the board of directors. Reuters
            reported the appointment earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Co-Head of Brazil Investment Banking Will Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s co-head
            of investment banking in Brazil, Fabio Bicudo, will leave the
            company 10 months after taking the job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs confirmed his departure yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The firm declined to say
            whether it will
            replace Bicudo, who has led Brazil investment banking since
            March with co-head Antonio Pereira. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo said in a separate statement he had been invited to
            lead a Brazilian company he declined to name. Reuters reported
            that Bicudo will become chief executive officer of Eneva SA, the
            utility controlled by EON SE and former billionaire Eike
            Batista, citing a person familiar with the matter. Eneva
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
            Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
            the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
            Sachs's revenue from investment banking had been falling in
            Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
            people familiar with the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About a quarter of Goldman Sachs's roughly 45-person Brazil
            investment-banking division have departed, four people with
            knowledge of the moves said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our headcount in Brazil is going to be steady at around
            300 people, though it may go up 5 percent or down 5 percent,'
            Stephen Scherr, Goldman Sachs's chief for Latin America and
            global head of the investment bank's financing group, said in an
            interview in New York in October. 'The composition of the
            people is going to change -- and that is by design,' Scherr
            said, declining to comment on specific departures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira were named co-heads of investment
            banking for the country after Daniel Wainstein, one of only two
            Goldman Sachs partners who are Brazilian, left the company in
            June after 13 years. Wainstein joined New York-based Greenhill
            Co. in October. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Libyan Investment Authority Sues Goldman Sachs in London</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Libyan Investment Authority, the north African nation's sovereign wealth fund, sued Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in the U.K. over investments worth more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman
            Sachs abused the relationship of trust and confidence with the then newly-formed LIA, being the sovereign
            wealth fund of the Libyan people,' a spokesman for the fund, who declined to give his name in line with
            company policy, said in an e-mailed statement today. The fund suffered 'significant losses.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libya's
            sovereign wealth fund built up assets of about $60 billion under Muammar Qaddafi, who was deposed and killed
            in a 2011 coup. The LIA lost about $1.75 billion betting on structured products in 2007 and 2008, about $900
            million of which was with Goldman Sachs, its former chairman said in June 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion:
            What Was Goldman Sachs Doing With Libya's Options Bets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of the lawsuit, filed
            Jan. 21 at London's High Court, aren't yet public. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Goldman Sachs's
            dealings with the LIA for possible violations of American anti-corruption laws. The fund has said it is
            cooperating with the authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fund Size &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libya has the
            second-largest sovereign wealth fund in Africa with about $65 billion, according to the Sovereign Wealth
            Fund Institute, and the 20th largest in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mohsen Derregia, the fund's former
            chairman, said in March of last year it had demanded an explanation from Societe Generale SA (GLE) on how
            derivative contracts lost about $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Losses between 15 and 16 percent are
            considered acceptable, but our shares devalued by up to 80 percent,' he said in an interview. 'We want to
            know what happened.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is: The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman Sachs
            International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sells 1 Billion Euros of Madrid Debt Amid Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs International sold 1
            billion euros ($1.33 billion) of a Sept. 15, 2026, Madrid region
            note today as the second-biggest contributor to Spain's economy
            seeks to benefit from a rally in the nation's securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman placed the notes privately while five banks took
            part in the syndicated sale of a 2018 note, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. The five-year notes were sold at a spread of 190
            basis points over the reference 2018 Treasury bond, according to
            people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named
            because they're not authorized to speak about it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The region tapped the markets after the Treasury yesterday
            saw record demand for a 10-year bond. Spain's Cabinet last week
            gave Madrid, Galicia, Navarra and Aragon a green light to issue
            4.4 billion euros of bonds amid a surge in investor interest for
            Spanish shares as well as government and corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madrid's economy department said it has sold the 2.3
            billion euros of debt it was authorized to issue on Jan. 18 and
            that details will be given today at 5 p.m. in Madrid. The amount
            represents about 60 percent of the region's 2013 funding needs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a Madrid-based
            consultancy, estimates gross debt sales from the regions of
            about 30 billion euros this year, excluding short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Treasury plans to raise 23 billion euros for the
            nation's regional rescue fund known as FLA, created last year to
            prevent any regional default, and that was tapped by nine of 17
            semi-autonomous regions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Budget Ministry has imposed a debt ceiling of 172
            billion euros on the regions this year, or 16 percent of gross
            domestic product. That compares with outstanding debt of 167
            billion euros in the third quarter and includes 102 billion
            euros of bank loans, with the remainder mostly in bonds,
            according to the Bank of Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is the bank that generates the
            most revenue from equity trading worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Defended by Danish Lawmaker in Dong Buyout Dispute</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the right investor for Dong Energy A/S, a top official of
            Denmark's ruling Social Democrats said, defending the Wall Street firm against criticism from other
            parliament members. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman's European merchant banking unit is seeking to buy an 18
            percent stake in state-controlled Dong, a utility in need of new equity after losing money on failed natural
            gas bets. Some Danish lawmakers want to block the 8 billion-krone ($1.5 billion) purchase, saying Goldman
            Sachs bears responsibility for the global financial crisis and that the government is giving the New
            York-based company too much control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If we were to not deal with banks until we had
            bashed all those who deserved to get bashed, we would never get anywhere, and we have to move on,' Benny
            Engelbrecht, the Social Democrats' business spokesman, said in an interview in Copenhagen. 'Applying that
            kind of logic would leave us without any banks to work with.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the
            government's Dec. 3 proposal, Goldman Sachs will be able to veto a possible sale of new shares or hybrid
            capital, any change in Dong's senior management or acquisitions before a possible 2018 initial public
            offering. The state will retain a 57.3 percent stake in Skaerbaek-based Dong, which also operates offshore
            wind parks and explores for oil and gas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Fascinated' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other
            minority owners are ATP and PFA, the country's two largest pension funds, as well as five local energy
            companies. Neither will get the same veto powers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Red-Green Alliance, which has 12
            of 179 seats in parliament, says the state, not Goldman Sachs, should inject the money that Dong needs. The
            alliance, which includes former members of Denmark's communist party, has filed more than 100 questions to
            the finance ministry regarding the sales process and the privileges given to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We
            would have liked if the government had considered who Goldman are and what they want,' Stine Brix, the
            deputy financial speaker for the party, said in an interview. 'Goldman has a very doubled-faced story. On
            one hand, everybody is fascinated with how good they are, but they also act without guilt or remorse.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Abusive' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in July 2010 agreed to pay $550 million and change
            its business practices to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's claims that the firm misled
            investors in a 2007 product linked to subprime mortgages. The firm didn't admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A U.S. Senate subcommittee's report in 2011 said Goldman Sachs relied on 'abusive' sales practices
            and was rife with conflicts of interest that encouraged putting profits ahead of clients. While Goldman
            Sachs said it disagreed with many of the Senate report's finding, the firm also noted that it undertook a
            review of its business practices and released a 63-page report on its findings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is
            a long-term investment and we support the management team's current strategy across the company's
            activities, including the significant renewable energy investments,' Sophie Ramsay, a London-based
            spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. 'This strategy, supported by the
            Danish State and other minority shareholders, will create value for all shareholders in the years to come.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Morally Wrong &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selling to Goldman Sachs is morally wrong,
            jeopardizes Denmark's green agenda and will prove to be a financial mistake, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a former
            Danish prime minister, was quoted as saying in an interview published by newspaper Politiken today. Nyrup
            Rasmussen, a Social Democrat, has also served as leader of the Europe-wide socialist group in the European
            Union. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bjarne Corydon, Denmark's current finance minister and also a Social Democrat,
            defended the sale in an interview broadcast by TV2 News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I can understand that there's
            a debate about banks' behavior in the wake of the financial crisis,' Corydon said in response to Nyrup
            Rasmussen's comment. 'Dong was in a situation where money was needed. We have chosen a proactive answer, the
            green answer, by going with the investment strategy.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Opposition Growing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Danish People's Party, which has 22 seats in Denmark's assembly, initially backed the
            government's plan to find private investors for Dong. Now the party has threatened to withdraw its support.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't understand why Goldman should be able to hire and fire the management or why
            they need to be able to veto the strategy when it's already in place,' said Rene Christensen, financial
            spokesman for party. 'The government says there's no need to worry about the clauses, but that only made us
            more curious as to why they had to make them in the first place.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as opposition to
            the Goldman Sachs deal is growing, the government will probably be able to pass the proposal with the
            support of the Conservative Party and the Liberals Party, Engelbrecht of the Social Democrats said. The
            Liberals are Denmark's biggest opposition party. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Engelbrecht last year led lawmakers'
            push for rules that require Denmark's biggest lenders, including Danske Bank A/S to hold additional capital
            reserves to prevent a future banking crisis. While Goldman played a role in the financial crisis, the bank
            is no worse than others, Engelbrecht said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman is getting bashed for the same
            reason Danske Bank got bashed. It's the icon of capitalism and greed, though at a whole different level than
            Danske Bank,' he said. 'The critics forget that this investment is being made by the division in Goldman
            that actually specializes in renewables, and with the level of professionalism displayed by Goldman, that's
            not a bad thing.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Advise EBay as Icahn Intensifies Campaign</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is working
            for EBay Inc. (EBAY) as it faces calls from Carl Icahn to split off its
            PayPal unit, people with knowledge of the matter said, the
            investment bank's latest assignment with a technology company
            facing an activist investor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is a long-time adviser to EBay on a number of
            issues, Amanda Miller, spokeswoman for the online marketplace,
            said while declining to discuss the specifics of the bank's current
            role regarding Icahn's efforts. 'We did not engage them specifically
            for this matter,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank also has advised Apple (AAPL) Inc. and
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the people said, asking not to be identified
            discussing private information. Apple faces calls for a bigger
            stock buyback from Icahn, and Microsoft recently said it will
            allow ValueAct Capital Management LLC President Mason Morfit to
            join its board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment banks are building up practices that advise
            companies on how to deter and respond to activists, as the
            investors garner more money and institutional backing. Funds
            managed by activists have almost tripled over five years, to $93
            billion at the end of last year from about $32 billion in 2008,
            according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, the activist defense practice has been
            spearheaded by partner Bill Anderson, who joined the bank in
            2000. Anderson was previously an MA lawyer at Simpson Thacher
            Bartlett LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Engaging Activists &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Icahn informed EBay last week he had begun purchasing the
            online marketplace's shares and was nominating two directors to
            its board, the company said. Icahn called a separation of PayPal
            -- one of EBay's faster-growing businesses -- from the company a
            'no-brainer' in an interview on Bloomberg TV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
            comment, as did Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lately, companies have been more proactively engaging
            activists before their efforts become public. Icahn's demands
            for for the PayPal split were disclosed by the San Jose,
            California-based company in its quarterly earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe spoke with Icahn
            last week and said on a conference call the company should stay
            together, citing how the intertwined entity helps fund PayPal's
            expansion into areas such as mobile. The payments unit boosted
            sales 19 percent last quarter, outpacing 12 percent sales growth
            at EBay's marketplace unit, which faces stiff competition from
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Technology Targets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Icahn's EBay investment follows a string of actions by
            activists taking on Silicon Valley technology firms, especially
            as some of the companies' rapid growth rates slow. Icahn has
            this week tweeted that he increased his stake in Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He is proposing that the company commit to buying back at
            least $50 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2014, something that
            Apple is recomending investors vote against. Goldman Sachs
            advised Apple's board as it weighed an earlier push from
            Greenlight Capital Inc.'s David Einhorn to issue more preferred
            stock which would pay a higher dividend than common stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft signed a pact to cooperate with ValueAct in
            August, four months after the activist fund disclosed a stake of
            about $1.9 billion in the software maker and at the deadline for
            proxy contests ahead of a November annual meeting. ValueAct, the
            San Francisco-based firm headed by Jeffrey Ubben, has since
            increased its stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Microsoft said it would allow
            Morfit to join the board and hold regular meetings with Morfit,
            directors and select management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co., Juniper Networks
            Inc. and Riverbed Technology Inc. are also facing activist
            pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blankfein Says Goldman Has Controls for Hiring of Connected Kids</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has
            controls in place to avoid conflicts of interest when clients
            request jobs for their children, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I've had people who say, 'Look, my kid's in the blankety-blank business school in the United
            States, and really would
            like a job in finance, really would like a job at Goldman
            Sachs,'' Blankfein, 59, said today in a CNBC interview at the
            World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'I'm thinking about
            how it could look, and so we have a lot of processes to vet
            these things.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When asked if he had seen any hiring that appeared to be a
            bribe, Blankfein said, 'Not firsthand.' U.S. regulators are
            looking at hiring practices in China amid an investigation into
            JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein joined Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman in
            pointing out that many talented employees happen to be children
            of powerful leaders in China and in other parts of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you precluded yourself from hiring any kid that was
            affiliated with somebody or whose parent was an important
            official or important industrialist or executive, you wouldn't
            have very many people left,' Blankfein said. 'Who do you think
            the kids are that are multicultural and filling Harvard Business
            School?' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman CEO Tells BBC Worst of Financial Crisis is Over</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein is optimistic that the
            worst of the financial crisis is over, according to an interview
            with the British Broadcasting Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The moment of crisis is over,' Blankfein told the BBC.
            'I find a lot of things to be optimistic about, including the
            worst expected or worrisome problems that everyone talked about
            last year are off the table,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who became CEO in 2006, has overseen the New
            York-based firm's highest profits and biggest losses as a public
            company. He also warned about the potential for a credit crisis
            during a June 2007 conference, 15 months before the collapse of
            Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Problems related to the financial crisis have been chewed
            through,' he told the BBC. 'Net, net I'm optimistic. That is
            my predictive self.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein said the firm's deliberations over whether to
            defer the payment of incentive compensation due to U.K.
            employees until after the top rate of income tax drops April
            weren't linked to 'tax evasion or tax avoidance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs won't delay its distribution of U.K. bonuses
            to help minimize employees' tax rates, a person with direct
            knowledge of the decision said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blankfein Says He Wouldn't Leave Goldman Sachs If Pay Were Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Lloyd Blankfein, whose bonus for last year almost doubled, said he
            would stay as chief executive officer even if the company cut
            his pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Not today, no,' Blankfein said today in an interview on
            CNBC, responding to a question about whether he would leave if
            the New York-based firm paid him less. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, was granted $13.3 million in restricted
            stock for last year that comprises about 70 percent of his total
            bonus, a person with knowledge of the matter said last week. On
            that basis, the total bonus is about $19 million including $5.7
            million in cash, up from a $10 million stock-and-cash award for
            2011. Blankfein, who is also the bank's chairman, receives a $2
            million salary. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I've been in this firm for 30 years,' Blankfein said in
            the interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 'Most of my
            interest in Goldman Sachs comes from trading in my partnership
            interest for stock. So I'm more of a shareholder than an
            employee.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A $21 million total compensation package would be
            Blankfein's highest since his $68.5 million record in 2007, when
            Goldman Sachs's earnings per share were 75 percent higher. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sells Its First Benchmark Bonds in Euros for 1 1/2 Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised 1
            billion euros ($1.3 billion) from its first benchmark sale in
            the currency for 1 1/2 years, just a week after issuing $6
            billion of debt in its biggest deal ever. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank sold 3.25 percent senior, unsecured 10-year
            notes that were priced to yield 155 basis points more than the
            swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal
            lifts total corporate bond sales in Europe this week to about 19
            billion euros, matching the previous week's volume. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is borrowing money as the European Central
            Bank said today that banks will hand back more of its three-year
            emergency loans than forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
            survey. That boosted investor confidence and helped send the
            cost of insuring bank debt down from near a four-week high. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's still strong demand for financial debt in
            Europe,' said Georg Grodzki, the head of credit research at
            Legal General Investment Management in London, which manages
            more than $600 billion of bonds. 'Yields may be heading up soon
            and fast if Goldman Sachs's own economic optimism proves
            correct' and interest rates rise, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,

        <headline>Russia Hires Goldman to Boost Investor Image Abroad</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to boost its image abroad as the most corrupt country
            among the Group of 20 last year seeks to attract foreign investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Economy Ministry
            and the Russian Direct Investment Fund have signed a memorandum with Goldman under which the New York-based
            bank will advise on issues such as communicating government decisions, according to Deputy Economy Minister
            Sergei Belyakov. State-owned banks including OAO Sberbank (SBER) and VTB Group will also assist, he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't know how to communicate with investors,' Belyakov told reporters today in
            Moscow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin last year ordered the government to improve Russia's
            standing in the World Bank's Doing Business rating to 20th by 2018. It climbed eight positions to 112 in the
            latest study, issued in October. While that's better than BRIC peers India and Brazil, Russia is still the
            worst among major economies in terms of graft, Transparency International said last month in its annual
            Corruption Perceptions Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy exporter plans to raise a
            record $10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an
            interview with Bloomberg Television this month. While corruption continues to be an issue, it's less of an
            issue for foreign investors who have already committed to Russia, Shuvalov said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stocks,
            Ruble &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) has gained 6 percent this year, beating
            the MSCI's Emerging Markets Index's 0.7 percent advance. The ruble-denominated equity gauge was little
            changed at 1,563.37 by the close of trade in Moscow. The ruble, which has gained 1.3 percent against the
            dollar in 2013, fell 0.5 percent to 30.1920. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A working group will draw up a list of
            measures to bolster Russia's image next month, according to Belyakov. The group will include Economy
            Ministry, Goldman and state bank representatives, as well as Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and central
            bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The death in custody in 2009 of Sergei
            Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management Ltd. who accused officials of embezzling $230 million,
            is a symbol of Russia's failure to tackle corruption, according to Christopher Granville, managing director
            of Trusted Sources, a London-based emerging-markets research group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magnitsky and Hermitage head William Browder are being tried in absentia on tax-evasion charges.
            Browder, who denies wrongdoing, has lobbied for U.S. and European legislation targeting Russian officials
            who he says are responsible for Magnitsky's death with visa bans and asset freezes. Hermitage was once
            Russia's biggest foreign equity investor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'To say that Russia is equal only to this
            tragedy is not quite right,' Belyakov said, referring to Magnitsky's death. 'To some degree the work that we
            announced today is to ensure that all our actions won't be annulled by statements like those from Browder.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. in December imposed a visa ban and asset freeze on Russian officials implicated
            in Magnitsky's death. In retaliation, Russia banned the adoption of Russian children in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
            that Magnitsky's death has been 'politicized' by investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sold Largest Apple-Tied Note in 11 Months Before Results</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $29.9 million of six-month structured notes tied to Apple Inc.
            (AAPL) the day before the company announced earnings that sent its stock plunging 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Jan. 22, yield 10 percent a year, plus any gains of the stock up to 11.25
            percent, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If Apple drops,
            the notes -- which were sold at a face value about the same as a share of the Cupertino, California-based
            company -- decline at the same rate, providing no protection against losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notes
            are Goldman Sachs's largest offering tied to the company since Feb. 24, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Structured notes, which are bank debt packaged with derivatives, allow individual investors to
            take bets on everything from the price of gold to movements in stock volatility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffany
            Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related
            story: A Devil's Bargain Faces Investors in Popular Structured Notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes tied to single
            stocks or indexes tend to limit the amount that investors can lose by including so-called barriers or
            principal protection, Bloomberg data show. Goldman sold $14 million of automatically callable three-year
            notes tied to the iPad maker on Jan. 4, the second-largest Apple note this month, that yield 9.2 percent a
            year and shield investor capital as long as the stock doesn't fall more than 30 percent, according to a
            prospectus filed with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple shares tumbled on Jan. 24 after the company posted
            the slowest profit growth since 2003 and the smallest sales increase in 14 quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Popular
            Reference &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, investors bought $1.75 billion of structured notes tied to Apple,
            making it the second-most popular reference measure after the Standard Poor's 500 Index, Bloomberg data
            show. Notes linked to Apple surpassed those tied to the London interbank offered rate for the first time
            since at least 2010, when Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on the securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors
            have bought $65.6 million of Apple-linked notes in January. On the day before the earnings report, HSBC
            Holdings Plc's U.S. banking unit also sold $710,000 of notes tied to the company, and UBS AG issued $120,000
            of securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Structured notes offer customized bets to retail investors while banks
            earn fees and raise money from selling the products. Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
            stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Siemens AG (SIE) has chosen Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) to advise on the sale of its water technologies unit,
            Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale may officially begin in the second quarter, the
            news agency said, citing the sources. Siemens announced plans to
            dispose of the water unit, which has annual sales of about 1
            billion euros ($1.35 billion), in November. Siemens and Goldman
            Sachs declined to comment, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several potential bidders have approached Munich-based
            Siemens, according to the news agency. It said industry sources
            expect Xylem Inc. (XYL) and Pentair Ltd. (PNR) to be interested as much of
            Siemens's water business is focused on North America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asian suitors may include Kurita Water Industries Ltd. (6370),
            Hyflux Ltd. (HYF), Hitachi Ltd. (6501) and Marubeni Corp. (8002), one of the people
            cited said. Private equity buyers are also expected to show

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Rates Salesman Shea Retires After 27 Years</headline>

            &lt;p&gt;Kevin Shea, an interest-rate
            salesman at Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. who has worked at the firm
            for 27 years, is retiring, according to a person briefed on the
            decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shea, 48, is leaving as of this month, said the person, who
            asked to remain anonymous because the decision hadn't been made
            public. He joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 1987 and was
            named managing director in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shea worked for 12 years as a trader on the bank's U.S.
            government debt desk before moving to London as part of the
            fixed-income sales group, according to a biography on the
            website of Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, where

        <headline>Goldman, Patria Bet on Brazil Telecom Building Boom</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Patria
            Investimentos SA are poised to benefit from a telecommunications
            building boom in Brazil as mobile-phone providers need companies
            to construct towers costing $320 million to $820 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, Patria and at least six other private-equity firms
            are backing five local tower builders as phone operators from
            Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) to Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) shift from
            constructing their own towers to contracting the work out.
            Operators will seek bids to build about 3,900 towers, more than
            half the 6,680 new towers needed in 2014 to improve networks,
            according to forecasts from one of the builders, who asked not
            to be identified because the estimates aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil is trying to boost services and reduce dropped calls
            as surging demand for high-speed Internet strains the current
            network. The country has about 61,000 towers installed today --
            slightly more than in the U.K., which is 1/20th the size and has
            a third of the population, said Chahram Zolfaghari, chief
            executive officer of builder Brazil Tower Co., the builder
            that's backed by investment firm 1848 Capital Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not talking about 10 percent or 20 percent growth -
            - it's like 100 percent,' Zolfaghari said in an interview at
            Bloomberg's Sao Paulo office about the number of towers needed
            in Brazil. 'They need to be doubled to properly attend to
            current needs.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Blackstone, Fishman &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the Brazilian
            hedge-fund firm founded by former central bank president Arminio Fraga, last year unveiled tower-investment
            fund Cell Site
            Solutions, while Patria Investimentos SA, a firm that includes
            Blackstone Group LP (BX) among its investors, has allocated 300
            million reais ($123 million) of capital to its Highline do
            Brasil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other companies planning to build towers in Brazil are T4U
            Tower Management, which is backed by Israel's Fishman Group; QMC
            Telecom International Holdings, whose investors include Peterson
            Partners LP and Housatonic Partners; and Brazil Tower. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An outside spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
            behalf of the company, as did an outside spokesman for Patria.
            Representatives from Peterson, Fishman and QMC didn't respond to
            requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More Brazilians are buying smartphones, while providers
            like Telefonica's Vivo brand and America Movil SAB (AMX)'s Claro unit
            are pushing data services to boost revenue, according to the
            companies' financial reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Crackdown &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tim was among the companies forced by regulatory agency
            Anatel to stop selling new lines for about 10 days in 2012 to
            address complaints about dropped calls. The crackdown, along
            with millions of reais in fines in the past several years, is
            putting pressure on companies to improve customer satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vivo needs 10,000 new towers in the next two years to meet
            traffic growth and government quality mandates, Chief Executive
            Officer Antonio Carlos Valente said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are starting to feel difficulties in the availability
            of steel and labor,' Valente said about challenges in building
            new towers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anatel doesn't regulate the tower market and sees demand
            increasing significantly in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a good business for tower builders,' said Anatel
            Superintendent Carlos Baigorri. 'Third-party tower builders
            will allow operators to focus on their core business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of the 6,680 new sites needed in Brazil, about 2,780 will
            be towers built by the operators themselves or shared towers in
            which companies install equipment alongside competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Profitable Sites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil Tower builds towers for 200,000 reais to 500,000
            reais apiece, its CEO says. That values the 3,900 to be built by
            third parties at 780 million to 2 billion reais, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil Tower then expects to sell
            the sites in bulk for as much as $300,000 each, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tower operating companies including SBA Communications
            Corp. (SBAC) and American Tower Corp. (AMT) have been expanding in the past
            two years as wireless providers prefer to lease towers rather
            than maintain them internally to preserve cash and limit
            investments. SBA agreed last month to pay 1.53 billion reais for
            2,007 Oi towers, or about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than
            twice the rate it paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi
            towers, according to Wells Fargo Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a long-term view of the market,' Kurt Bagwell,
            SBA's international president, said in a phone interview. 'We
            basically try to predict the growth of the revenue of these
            sites over time and we feel that the price we paid for these
            works for our business, no problem.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SBA rose 1.9 percent to $92.29 at the close in New York,
            while American Tower rose 2 percent to $81.18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Open Door &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cell Site, Brazil Tower, Highline do Brasil, T4U and QMC --
            the five largest builders in Brazil -- have the capacity to
            construct only as many as 1,600 towers a year, opening the door
            for other companies to step in to help build towers, according
            to the investor analysis obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody wants to do business in Brazil -- the problem
            is that to do business in Brazil is so difficult,' Brazil
            Tower's Zolfaghari said. 'Just in the state of Florida, you
            have 60 companies like us. Why do you think I'm in Brazil? Over
            there I would be one guy among hundreds.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Boost CEO's Bonus 11% to $21 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, the highest-paid head of a
            U.S. bank for 2012, saw his bonus increase 11 percent to $21
            million for his work last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who also serves as chairman, received 88,422
            restricted shares on Jan. 28 valued at $14.7 million, according
            to a regulatory filing. He also got a cash award amounting to
            the typical 30 percent of his total bonus, according to a person
            with knowledge of the payout. On that basis, the cash portion of
            his bonus would be about $6.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted stock
            awards for their CEOs this month after an improving U.S. economy
            drove up bank shares in 2013. Goldman Sachs had an 11 percent
            return on equity last year, topping its largest Wall Street
            rivals, while cutting pay costs amid revenue that was little
            changed. The stock jumped 39 percent in the year, more than the
            33 percent climb in the SP 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's bonus and $2 million salary amount to $3
            million more than what JPMorgan paid CEO Jamie Dimon. It was the
            second straight year that Blankfein out-earned his rival.
            Blankfein also got a $5 million long-term incentive a year ago
            tied to performance targets. Details of any 2014 long-term
            incentive will be disclosed later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Made $350 Million on 'Worthless' Trades, Libya Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made about
            $350 million on 'worthless' derivatives trades after exerting
            'undue influence' on managers of the Libyan Investment
            Authority, according to the sovereign-wealth fund, the second-largest in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LIA sued Goldman Sachs on Jan. 21 in London over
            investments of about $1 billion made in 2008. The fund said in
            court documents released today that its executives, who were
            given gifts of chocolate and after-shave by the bank, never
            understood the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The unique circumstances allowed Goldman Sachs to take
            advantage of the LIA's extremely limited financial and legal
            experience to deliberately exploit its position of influence and
            to take advantage in a way that generated colossal losses for
            the LIA but substantial profits for Goldman Sachs,' LIA
            Chairman AbdulMagid Breish said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libya's sovereign wealth fund built up assets of about $60
            billion under Muammar Qaddafi, who was deposed and killed in a
            2011 coup. The LIA lost about $1.75 billion betting on
            structured products in 2007 and 2008, about $900 million of
            which was with Goldman Sachs, its former chairman, Mohsen Derregia, said in June 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trips, Gifts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staff at the New York-based bank offered to train LIA
            employees at its London offices, took them on a trip to Morocco
            and bought them gifts to build a relationship, the fund said in
            the court filing. The 2008 derivatives were linked to shares in
            Citigroup Inc. (C), Electricite de France and Banco Santander SA. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Siddharth Prabhu, the head of
            corporate-credit index trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has
            left the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank,
            confirmed the departure and declined to comment further. Prabhu,
            who didn't immediately return an e-mail seeking comment, joined
            Goldman Sachs in 2001 and became a managing director in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which
            contains 125 companies from Ford Motor Co. to Staples Inc., is
            one of the most liquid credit instruments. Banks, hedge funds
            and other money managers have bought and sold a net $81.6
            billion of the current high-grade benchmark swaps index as of
            Jan. 24, according to the Depository Trust Clearing Corp.,
            which runs a central repository for the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sean Meeker, the head of loan and loan credit-default swap
            trading, and Jeff Bahl, the head of U.S. high-yield corporate
            bond trading, left Goldman Sachs in December, the bank confirmed
            at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-risk, high-yield bonds are rated
            below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and lower than BBB- at
            Standard Poor's. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
            borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
            defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. picked
            Raanan Agus to manage Liberty Harbor after the credit investment
            unit's Chief Investment Officer Gregg Felton quit this week,
            ending a six-year tenure there. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brendan McGovern and Sal Lentini will be the co-heads of
            Liberty Harbor's investment team, reporting to Agus, who is also
            global co-head of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, according
            to an internal memo sent on Jan. 28. Andrea Raphael, a
            spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McGovern was head of research and Lentini was head of
            credit trading in the Liberty Harbor team, according to the
            memo. Both were also senior portfolio managers. Agus will
            continue to run GSIP, a hedge fund that handles client money,
            with Ken Eberts, the firm said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McGovern and Lentini were part of a 17-person team led by
            Felton that Goldman Sachs hired in 2006 from defunct hedge fund
            Amaranth Advisors LLC. Liberty Harbor, which is part of Goldman
            Sachs's asset management group, is a global multi-strategy fund
            that seeks to profit from mispriced securities in credit
            markets, according to the bank's website. Liberty Harbor manages

        <headline>Oracle to Goldman Lead Record First Half Bond Offerings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bond sales worldwide capped
            the busiest first half of a year on record as borrowers take
            advantage of investor demand stoked by central banks'
            unprecedented stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which sold a
            combined $14 billion yesterday, pushed offerings during the
            first six months of 2014 to $2.29 trillion, beating the previous
            peak of $2.28 trillion issued during the same period in 2009,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday was the
            busiest day since June 10 in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central banks' actions to depress short-term lending rates
            have impelled institutional investors to seek higher-yielding
            company debt. While the European Central Bank cut its main
            refinancing rate to a record-low 15 basis points on June 5, the
            U.S. Federal Reserve is holding its benchmark rate near zero
            into a sixth year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The demand for these corporate bonds is so strong it's
            outstripping the record supply,' said Brian Reynolds, chief
            market strategist for brokerage firm Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
            in New York. 'Institutional investors like insurance companies
            and foundations are buying more aggressively now than ever in
            order to reach their yield targets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Issuance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oracle, the largest maker of database software, issued $10
            billion of bonds yesterday in the second-biggest dollar-denominated corporate bond offering this year, while
            Goldman
            Sachs sold $4 billion of notes, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Yesterday's offerings in the U.S. totaled $15.9
            billion, Bloomberg data show. The year's biggest corporate issue
            in the U.S. was a $12 billion sale from Apple Inc. in April, the
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance is accelerating as borrowers take advantage of
            yields approaching historic lows and the extra yield investors
            demand for the risk of holding corporate bonds instead of
            government securities is at about the least since 2007, Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. corporate bond market is off to its fastest pace
            for the first half of the year with more than $880 billion sold,
            up from $789 billion in the same period last year, Bloomberg
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-grade offerings reached $683.2 billion for the
            first half, beating the previous record of $655.4 billion set in
            the same period in 2009, Bloomberg data show. Yesterday's high-grade sales of $14.75 billion were the most
            since $16.1 billion
            on May 12, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade sales also reached a record for the first
            half, with $196.8 billion that topped the previous high of $184
            billion in 2013, the data show. High-yield, high-risk bonds are
            rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and less than BBB-at Standard Poor's. A basis point is 0.01
            percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. corporate bonds have generated returns of 5.9 percent,
            or 12.2 percent annualized, which would be the last decade's
            second best year after 2009. In the first half of that year,
            issuance surged as banks sold securities backed by the Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corp.'s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
            and credit markets began to unfreeze after the financial crisis,
            reviving investor confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Europe, companies are debuting a record amount of bonds
            as investors demanding higher yields show greater tolerance for
            untested borrowers who are seeking to diversify funding as banks
            curtail lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It reflects the reduced ability of European banks to make
            business loans,' said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's
            Capital Markets Research Group. 'Non-financial companies are
            being forced to enter the bond market to secure capital'
            because they can't rely on banks for loans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of junk bonds in Europe exceeded $100 billion this
            year for the first time, up from $56 billion in the first half
            of 2013, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The record global bond issuance has a European accent,'
            said Lonski. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was accused of widespread gender discrimination and a 'boy's club'
            atmosphere that included bouts of binge drinking and trips to strip clubs, as two former female employees
            seek to expand their lawsuit against the firm with new evidence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The women asked a
            federal judge in Manhattan today to let them sue on behalf of current and former female associates and vice
            presidents. Support for their claims includes statements of former Goldman Sachs employees, expert
            statistical analyses and evidence on earnings and promotions from the firm's own records, they said in a
            court filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Women report a 'boy's club' atmosphere, where binge drinking is common

            &lt;p&gt;The two women, H. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, sued in 2010 and are seeking to broaden
            the case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at Goldman Sachs. A decision by U.S.
            District Judge Analisa Torres to allow the women to sue as a class would increase the risk to Goldman Sachs.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in 2010, the women seek unspecified damages and an order requiring
            Goldman Sachs to fix the alleged gender bias at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Fined $800,000 by Finra Over Dark-Pool Pricing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was fined
            $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for
            failing to have procedures in place to ensure clients in its
            dark pool got the best price while trading stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 395,000 transactions were executed in the New
            York-based bank's Sigma X pool at an inferior price to the
            national best bid and offer from July 29 to Aug. 9, 2011, Finra
            said today in a statement. Stock venues in the U.S. are obliged
            to price trades at the NBBO or better. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs discovered the pricing errors and sent checks
            to customers to compensate for the mistakes, people with direct
            knowledge of the matter said in March. Finra said today that the
            firm returned $1.67 million to affected customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was unaware of the errors at the time,
            according to the Finra statement. The Standard Poor's 500
            Index tumbled 13 percent through the first eight days of August
            2011, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
            hit a multiyear high of 48 on Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs neither admitted nor denied Finra's charges.

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Names Hitchner as Asia Head, Replacing Ryan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top
            underwriter of share sales in Asia excluding Japan this year,
            said Ken Hitchner will become president for the region after
            David Ryan retires later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hitchner, who currently runs health-care banking and is co-head of the technology, media and
            telecommunications group, will
            be based in Hong Kong, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an
            e-mailed statement. Ryan, 43, will become a senior director, the
            bank said, without providing a reason for his retirement after
            two years in the role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm, which this year ceded its position as
            the top mergers adviser for Asia excluding Japan, hired Kate Richdale from Morgan Stanley (MS) in March to
            strengthen investment
            banking services. Hitchner will also work with Mark Schwartz,
            who rejoined the firm last year as chairman of the Asia-Pacific
            business, and Masa Mochida, who oversees Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs has been pretty good at regularly rotating
            people through the top positions,' said Philippe Espinasse, a
            Hong Kong-based former equity capital markets banker at UBS AG
            and Nomura Holdings Inc. Hiring someone with mergers experience,
            'is probably a function of the maturity of the Asian market
            now.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Navy Pilot &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue for Goldman Sachs in Asia climbed 16 percent to
            $5.39 billion last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hitchner, a 53-year-old former U.S. Navy pilot, has been
            with Goldman Sachs since 1991. As a banker in the health-care
            industry for more than 15 years, he has advised clients
            including Johnson Johnson (JNJ) on its $19.7 billion takeover of
            Synthes Inc. in 2012. He will oversee the day-to-day operations
            of Asia-Pacific businesses, excluding Japan, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser for equity and
            equity-linked offerings in Asia, excluding Japan, this year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's up from No. 5
            last year, the data show. The bank slipped to fourth in Asian
            MA advisory this year, excluding Japan, after having held the
            top spot for the past two years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ryan, a former head of the Asian financing group, was named
            co-president of the bank's Asian operations in 2011, along with
            Yusuf Alireza, who has since left the firm. During his tenure,
            the bank exited its seven-year investment in Industrial
            Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world's largest lender by
            market value. He has been with the firm since 1992. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was accused by two former employees seeking to expand their lawsuit
            of discriminating against women while male colleagues engaged in binge drinking and took clients to strip
            clubs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The women asked a federal judge in Manhattan yesterday to let them sue on behalf
            of current and former female associates and vice presidents. Support for their claims includes statements of
            former Goldman Sachs employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence on earnings and promotions from the
            firm's own records, they said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Women report a 'boy's club'
            atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored,' according to the
            filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two women, H. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, sued in 2010 and are
            seeking to broaden the case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at Goldman Sachs. A
            decision by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to allow the women to sue as a class would increase the risk
            to the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in 2010, the women seek unspecified
            damages and an order requiring Goldman Sachs to fix the alleged gender bias at the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Salaries,
            Promotions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Female vice presidents earned 21 percent less than men and female associates
            made 8 percent less, the former employees claimed. About 23 percent fewer female vice presidents were
            promoted to managing director of the bank relative to their male counterparts, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those
            statistics are attributed to an analysis of Goldman Sachs pay data by Henry S. Farber, a Princeton
            University economist. His samples included all associates and vice presidents in the firm's New York class
            from 2003 to 2011 and throughout the U.S. from 2005 to 2011, according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has denied the women's claims and is fighting the case. The bank believes the
            statistical arguments are misleading and don't compare similar employees to one another, said a person
            briefed on its legal strategy who requested anonymity because the firm hasn't responded to the data in
            court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is a normal and anticipated procedural step for any proposed class action
            lawsuit and does not change the case's lack of merit,' David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
            yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Strip Clubs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster and
            Orlich are seeking to persuade Torres that their claims are sufficiently similar to those of other women at
            Goldman Sachs so they can represent them in a single case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They're asking Torres to
            certify a class of female associates and vice presidents who worked for the company in the U.S. in its
            investment banking, investment management and securities divisions beginning Sept. 10, 2004. The start date
            for employees who worked in New York City would be July 7, 2002. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denise Shelley, a vice
            president who left the firm in 2009, said in a court filing that men at Goldman Sachs repeatedly called
            women 'bimbos,' mocked a new hire who had won a beauty pageant and took clients to strip clubs. Shelley said
            in the filing that she sat on the steering committee of the firm's network for women and, after joining
            colleagues at a bar, was called a 'party girl' by a managing director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is
            Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs Co., 10-cv-06950, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Names Hutton to Head Bond, Currency Sales in Australia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
            appointed Nell Hutton to head its fixed-income, currency and
            commodities sales for Australia and New Zealand, an internal
            memo showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hutton will report both to Simon Rothery, chief executive
            officer of Goldman Sachs' Australian operations, and to James Houghton, head of fixed-income, currency and
            commodities
            distribution for Asia Pacific ex-Japan, according to the memo
            seen by Bloomberg News. Hutton, who previously oversaw corporate
            advisory solutions in the region, joined Goldman in 1999 in
            London, relocated to Australia in 2006, and was named a managing
            director in 2007, the memo showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothery said in a Feb. 27 interview that Australian fixed-income trading was his biggest growth
            area in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's stable AAA credit rating made the nation a
            haven and has encouraged inflows from sovereign-wealth funds, he
            said. Goldman Sachs also saw opportunities to arrange debt
            offerings and capture more of the market for Kangaroo bonds, or
            Australian dollar-denominated securities sold by overseas
            borrowers, Rothery said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd. picked
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse
            Group AG to manage a sale of its shares in Indonesian Internet
            service provider PT Link Net Tbk (LINK), people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The London-based buyout firm may raise about $500 million
            from the offering, two of the people said, asking not to be
            identified as the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CVC is seeking to divest its stake after Link Net stock
            more than tripled since listing on the Indonesia Stock Exchange
            last month. At $500 million, the share sale would be the biggest
            in Indonesia this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, CVC and Indonesia's Lippo Group raised $1.5
            billion divesting their stakes in PT Matahari Department Store (LPPF)
            in Indonesia's biggest share sale, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. PT First Media Tbk, a company backed by Lippo Group, is
            the other main investor in Link Net. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CVC owns a 49 percent stake in Link Net, valued at about
            $742 million at the current share price, according to exchange
            filings. Link Net's initial public offering raised $42 million,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will have
            another two years to separate derivatives trading from units
            that get federal backing, according to a letter to the bank
            posted on the Federal Reserve website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed said in the letter that the New York-based bank
            must determine whether to kill the swaps activity or move it to
            properly capitalized affiliates. Under the Dodd-Frank Act rule
            requiring the swaps push-out, interest-rate and some credit
            swaps can still be traded inside the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The potential impact of granting a 24-month transition
            period is less adverse than the potential impact of denying the
            transition period,' Robert Frierson, secretary of the board,
            wrote in the letter dated yesterday. Giving Goldman Sachs the
            transition time lowers 'the probability of operational problems
            and market disruption,' Frierson wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank overhauled swaps trading in an effort to make
            the industry less vulnerable to a crisis such as the one that
            struck in 2008. The law requires equity, some commodity and non-cleared credit derivatives be pushed out of
            bank units with
            access to deposit insurance and the Fed's discount window. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,

            fraud case against former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive
            Fabrice Tourre, according to a lawyer for the witness. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre faces a July 15 trial on the SEC's lawsuit over his
            role in structuring a collateralized debt obligation known as
            Abacus 2007-AC1. His lawyers are seeking information from former
            ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. executive Laura Schwartz about an
            SEC notice she received earlier this year that the regulator may
            bring an action against her unrelated to Abacus. She is expected
            to testify against Tourre, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC, in a June 27 letter, told Schwartz's lawyer that
            its New York field office completed its investigation and didn't
            intend to recommend action against her, the lawyer, Robin
            Alperstein, said in a letter to the judge overseeing the Tourre
            case yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC says Tourre misled ACA and other investors in
            Abacus, claiming he didn't disclose that hedge fund Paulson
            Co. Inc. helped pick the securities underlying the CDO with the
            intention of betting against them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds packaged
            into new securities. Interest payments on the underlying bonds
            or loans are used to pay investors. The Abacus entity was a
            synthetic CDO, meaning its cash flow came from derivatives that
            referenced mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in 2010 agreed to pay $550 million to settle
            SEC claims against it in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a
            financier of wind and solar farms in India, raised $140 million
            from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Global Environment Fund and

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will provide an additional $70 million, ReNew
            said today in an e-mailed statement. It has already invested
            $385 million in the Gurgaon-based developer since 2011. The ADB

            &lt;p&gt;The money will allow ReNew to double its clean-energy
            portfolio to 1,000 megawatts by 2015, ReNew said. Goldman Sachs

        <headline>Goldman Urges Japan Inc. Share Sales for Foreign Demand</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the third-largest manager of Japanese equity offerings this year, is
            urging companies to sell shares and meet renewed investor demand
            for the nation's stocks under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Makoto Ito, co-head of the bank's financing group in Tokyo,
            plans to visit senior executives at more than 15 Japanese firms
            this week to propose that they consider raising funds, he said
            in an interview on July 1. Ito met global investors last week in
            Hong Kong and Singapore who manage more than 100 trillion yen
            ($1 trillion) in assets, he said, declining to name any of the
            companies or investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dentsu Inc. (4324) and Suntory Beverage Food Ltd. (2587) are among
            Japanese companies that are funding expansion abroad by issuing
            shares. The nation's equity offerings more than quadrupled to
            2.7 trillion yen in the first half of 2013, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. Ito, who was pessimistic on the market after
            stocks plunged since May, now says second-half sales will top
            the 1.5 trillion yen raised in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Global investors still have the appetite and a
            constructive view of Japan even under turbulent and uncertain
            circumstances,' Ito said after meeting with U.S. and Asian
            sovereign funds, hedge funds and asset managers on June 27 and
            28. 'Japanese firms are becoming more decisive to raise funds
            for investment and acquisitions for growth.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Temasek Said to Invest in Shanda's Cloudary</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Temasek
            Holdings Pte agreed to buy a minority stake in China's Cloudary
            Corp. (READ) at a 25 percent lower valuation than in a previous funding
            round, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The private placement values the operator of literary
            websites at about $600 million, less than an earlier valuation
            of $800 million, the people said, asking not to be identified
            because the information is private. Cloudary is controlled by
            Shanda Interactive Entertainment Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cloudary, which filed for a U.S. initial public offering
            more than two years ago, has yet to start the share sale. A
            gauge of Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. last month traded at
            the widest discount since 2008 to the Nasdaq Composite Index as
            measured by price-to-earnings ratios, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equity funds managed by Orbis bought 1.875 percent of
            Cloudary in May 2012 for $15 million, according to a filing with
            the Securities and Exchange Commission last year. The deal
            valued the company at $800 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear exactly how the investment in Cloudary will
            be carried out. Officials at Temasek, Goldman Sachs and Shanda
            declined to comment or weren't immediately available. Sina.com
            reported on the investment by Goldman Sachs and Temasek earlier
            today, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cloudary, based in Shanghai, applied for a $200 million New
            York IPO in May 2011. Goldman Sachs had been named to help
            manage the listing in July 2011 though is no longer involved in
            the process. The company, led by former Bank of America Corp.
            banker Robert Chiu, hired Bank of America, Citic Securities Co.
            and CICC HK Securities as underwriters, according to a filing
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Posts Surprise Profit Gain on Trading, Deal Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reported a surprise increase in second-quarter profit as fixed-income
            revenue fell less than many analysts projected and investment-banking fees rose. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net
            income climbed 5 percent to $2.04 billion, or $4.10 a share, from $1.93 billion, or $3.70, a year earlier,
            the New York-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $3.09 average estimate of 25 analysts in
            a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, has pledged not to
            overreact to a trading slump that's now in its fifth year as he positions the firm to pick up market share
            from other banks that are pulling back. Blankfein is also relying on underwriting stocks and bonds, which
            accounted for 14 percent of revenue in the second quarter, the highest portion since 2000. First-half
            investment-banking fees climbed to a record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We've got a strong beat here, primarily
            revenue-driven, and Goldman is a little more resilient than expected,' Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Group
            Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: JPMorgan Profit Beats
            Estimates on Trading, Shares Climb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs climbed 1 percent to $168.59 at 12:42
            p.m. in New York. The stock dropped 5.8 percent this year through yesterday, making it the worst performer
            in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 6 percent to $9.13 billion.
            Compensation, the firm's biggest expense, climbed to $3.92 billion, or 43 percent of revenue, the same
            percentage as a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equity Investments &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest
            surprise compared to many analysts' estimates was the gain on the firm's equity investments in its Investing
            and Lending segment, which totaled $1.25 billion. That was almost double the $650 million expected by
            Barclays Plc's Jason Goldberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said that
            business has repeatedly been a strong performer, Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo Co., said
            investors value such revenue at lower multiples than that of other units because it's so unpredictable. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They had a very good quarter in principally selling some assets in their private-equity
            portfolio,' said Kenneth Leon, an analyst who covers the financial industry for SP Capital IQ. 'It was the
            lumpy transactions that really made the revenue stand out.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;FICC Results &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currency and commodity trading revenue was $2.22 billion, surpassing estimates of
            $1.79 billion from Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., and $2.1 billion from Goldberg at
            Barclays. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 9 percent second-quarter drop in bond-trading revenue, excluding an
            accounting adjustment, beat the 24 percent decline predicted by Burnell. JPMorgan Chase Co. today posted a
            15 percent drop in fixed-income revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's revenue from the equities
            division declined 11 percent from a year earlier to $1.63 billion, excluding accounting adjustments. That
            compared with Hintz's $1.54 billion estimate and Goldberg's $1.71 billion projection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            the trading performance was better than expected, it still marked the lowest first-half revenue since the
            financial crisis in 2008. The bank earned a 10.9 percent return on equity in the quarter, a third of the
            level before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Abnormal' Trading &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs President Gary Cohn, 53, said in May that the current environment is 'abnormal' and features trading
            clients that are the least active in years. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield maintained the smallest
            range in 35 years in the three months ended in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If markets never move or don't
            move, our clients really don't need to transact,' Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm has cut 10 percent
            of its fixed-income workforce since 2010 and reduced the risk-weighted assets in that business by $90
            billion in the past two years. It has also relied on other businesses for growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter
            revenue from investment banking, the business run globally by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John
            S. Weinberg, climbed 15 percent to $1.78 billion. That compared with JPMorgan's $1.77 billion in
            investment-banking revenue and Citigroup's $1.34 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs figure
            included $506 million of financial-advisory revenue, including fees for takeover advice, an increase of 4
            percent. Revenue from underwriting climbed to $1.28 billion in the quarter, including $730 million from debt
            underwriting and $545 million for equity offerings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MA Advice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs held the top spot among arrangers of global equity, equity-linked and rights offerings in the first
            half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked first in advising on announced mergers and
            acquisitions and fifth in underwriting U.S. bonds, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investing and Lending
            posted total second-quarter revenue of $2.07 billion, up from $1.42 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            firm has about $8 billion of stakes in private-equity funds that it must cut to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, which limits the amount banks can invest in such funds, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue
            from asset management, run by Timothy O'Neill and Eric Lane, rose 8 percent to $1.44 billion. Total assets
            under supervision climbed $59 billion during the quarter to $1.14 trillion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Stress-Test Stumble Leads to Repo Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
            to resubmit its capital plan this year after falling below a
            minimum leverage ratio, used that experience as motivation to
            cut lending through repurchase agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
            billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
            Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
            assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm's
            'matched book' repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said today in a conference call with
            analysts after the
            New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
            bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
            supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
            compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
            reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
            Reserve's stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
            percent minimum of a separate requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
            a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
            potential,' Schwartz said. 'One of the significant inputs into
            the process obviously was CCAR.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
            securities lending to fund clients while using the same
            collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Repo Failures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's asset reductions also affect other secured
            financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn't
            release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results today,
            it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and secured
            financing agreements at the end of March, which represented
            about 40 percent of its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank hadn't seen a pressing need to cut back on the
            low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
            test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
            according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm's
            discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs's
            decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
            anonymous because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
            the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
            have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
            deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
            repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot's been written about the repo markets,' Schwartz
            said on the call. 'Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
            matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
            but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
            because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
            constraints.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's ratio under the proposed supplementary
            leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
            firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Beats Estimates on Investment Banking, Debt Gains</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said earnings doubled, beating analysts' estimates on a surge in
            underwriting revenue and gains from the firm's own investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net
            income rose to $1.93 billion, or $3.70 a share, from $962 million, or $1.78, a year earlier, the New
            York-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $2.89 average estimate of 27 analysts in a
            Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains from debt investments almost tripled and fixed-income trading
            climbed 12 percent as Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, led Goldman Sachs through a drop in
            bond prices sparked by indications in May that the Federal Reserve may ease economic-stimulus measures. The
            bank has said it will benefit from expense cuts completed last year and a rebound in the U.S. economy that
            could fuel stock gains. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Look ahead, and the opportunity is really on risk-taking moving
            from debt to equity, and that plays very much into Goldman's strengths,' Kenneth Leon, an analyst at
            Standard Poor's Capital IQ unit, told Erik Schatzker and Sara Eisen in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
            'Directionally Goldman looks good.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $2.76, or 1.7 percent, to $160.24
            at 4:04 p.m. in New York. The stock had gained 28 percent this year through yesterday after advancing 41
            percent in 2012. The shares are still below their pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
            Street bank that generates most of its revenue from trading,
            sold $2.5 billion of five-year bonds after reporting second-quarter profits that beat analysts' estimates.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2.9 percent notes, expected to be rated A3 by Moody's
            Investors Service, yield 155 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold $2.75 billion of 2.375 percent
            debentures due 2018 in January that were priced to yield 165
            basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. Those
            securities traded yesterday at 98.8 cents on the dollar to yield
            2.66 percent, or a 127.7 basis-point spread, according to Trace,
            the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
            Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that earnings doubled on a surge
            in underwriting revenue and gains from the firm's own
            investments. Second-quarter net income rose to $1.93 billion, or
            $3.70 a share, from $962 million, or $1.78, a year earlier. That
            beat the $2.89 average estimate of 27 analysts in a Bloomberg
            survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
            according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who
            asked not to be identified because terms aren't set. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Raises First-Half Pay Less Than Revenue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, set aside a
            smaller portion for staff pay in the first half and cut 300 jobs in the second quarter as it seeks to pare
            expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation, which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of
            deferred pay awarded in prior years, rose 10 percent to $8.04 billion in the first six months, the New
            York-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in the same period increased 13 percent to $18.7
            billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, is controlling expenses to
            boost return on equity, a measure of profitability, above last year's 10.7 percent. Compensation was 38
            percent of revenue in 2012, the second-lowest since Goldman Sachs has been a public company. The ratio of
            pay to revenue fell in the first half to 43 percent from 44 percent in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The culture around compensation is really making sure that we continue to attract and retain all
            the best people,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said at an investor conference in May. 'The firm
            now is running with 75 percent more capital now than it was before the crisis, and so we want to make sure
            that we do our best to get the balance right for our shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first-half
            compensation expense is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs's 31,700 employees $253,691 for the first six
            months of the year. The firm set aside $7.29 billion in the same period of 2012, equal to an average
            $225,789 for each of the 32,300 people employed by Goldman Sachs at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation
            for corporate and investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. lender, was almost
            unchanged in the first half from a year earlier. The $6.36 billion represented 33 percent of revenue at the
            unit, which was created last year when the company combined its investment bank with the corporate bank and
            treasury and securities-services units. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Figures for average pay don't represent what any
            employee actually receives and are calculated by dividing the total compensation expense by the number of
            workers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Is 'Comfortable' With U.S. Leverage Ratio</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the firm is 'very
            comfortable' with its ability to meet a proposed U.S. minimum
            ratio of capital to assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, speaking on a conference call with analysts and
            investors today, declined to estimate where the leverage ratio
            stands for the parent company or the bank subsidiary. Under the
            U.S. plan, the company would need capital equal to 5 percent of
            assets and the bank unit must have 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will wait to see how the U.S. proposal
            changes before taking action, Schwartz said. Earlier this year,
            he told investors the New York-based bank had benefited from not
            acting on a proposed rule on risk weighting for mortgages, a
            regulation that was later softened. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a proposed rule, so let's see how the dialogue
            goes with regulators,' Schwartz said. 'Predicting rules and
            responding can be incredibly costly, you can get wildly
            misdirected.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed leverage ratios for the biggest U.S. banks go
            beyond the 3 percent global minimum requirement that the Basel
            Committee on Banking Supervision approved to help prevent
            another financial crisis. The changes would make eight lenders
            fund more of their assets with capital that can absorb losses
            instead of with borrowed money. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Hold Board of Directors Meeting in Germany</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which said
            a jump in European deals helped it post record underwriting
            revenue in the second quarter, is holding its board of directors
            meeting this week in Germany, the Continent's largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chairman Lloyd C. Blankfein and the other directors are
            traveling to Frankfurt and Berlin, according to two people
            briefed on the trip who requested anonymity because the details
            weren't public. The board met with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann yesterday and will meet with other top
            German officials
            this week, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's 13-member board of directors has typically
            held a meeting annually outside of the U.S., traveling in past
            years to Brazil, Russia, India and China. The New York-based
            bank opened its office in Frankfurt in 1990, the year that
            Germany last won the World Cup soccer tournament before taking
            the title again this week in Brazil. The firm's analysts
            predicted in May that Brazil would win. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the second-ranked underwriter of equity
            offerings in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, behind Deutsche
            Bank AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It advised
            Volkswagen AG, Europe's largest carmaker, on its takeover of
            truck producer Scania AB, the second-largest deal this year
            involving a German company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Monika Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
            to comment on the trip and whether board members would meet with
            German Chancellor Angela Merkel. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Stress-Test Stumble Leads to Cut in Repo Lending</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
            to resubmit its capital plan this year after falling below a
            minimum leverage ratio, used that experience as motivation to
            cut lending through repurchase agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
            billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
            Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
            assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm's
            'matched book' repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said yesterday in a conference call
            with analysts after
            the New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
            bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
            supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
            compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
            reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
            Reserve's stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
            percent minimum of a separate requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
            a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
            potential,' Schwartz said. 'One of the significant inputs into
            the process obviously was CCAR.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
            securities lending to fund clients while using the same
            collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Repo Failures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's asset reductions also affect other secured
            financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn't
            release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results
            yesterday, it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and
            secured financing agreements at the end of March, which
            represented about 40 percent of its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank hadn't seen a pressing need to cut back on the
            low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
            test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
            according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm's
            discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs's
            decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
            anonymous because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
            the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
            have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
            deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
            repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot's been written about the repo markets,' Schwartz
            said on the call. 'Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
            matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
            but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
            because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
            constraints.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's ratio under the proposed supplementary
            leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
            firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hypo Alpe Said to Pick SachsenAM, Lampe to Draft Bad Bank Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International
            AG, the nationalized Austrian lender burdened with bad debt,
            chose Sachsen Asset Management GmbH and Bankhaus Lampe KG to
            draft a plan for spinning off its bad-assets unit, said two
            people with knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hypo Alpe, based in Klagenfurt, Austria, told the two
            German advisers to come up with a plan for the unit with at
            least 12 billion euros ($16 billion) in assets that minimizes
            the burden for the Austrian government's budget, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified because the plan isn't
            public. A decision won't be made before Austria's national
            elections on Sept. 29, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Klaus Liebscher, the former central bank governor who leads
            the government agency dealing with bank aid, known as Fimbag,
            declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Hypo Alpe,
            SachsenAM and Bankhaus Lampe officials declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Austria is accelerating Hypo Alpe's breakup to gain
            European Union approval for the 2.2 billion euros in state aid
            the lender received in the last five years. Once its operating
            units are sold, it will end up with the non-performing and
            unsellable assets, which include Croatian hotel project loans,
            leasing contracts across eastern Europe and seized loan
            collateral ranging from shopping malls to yachts and tractors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Debt Fears &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Maria Fekter opposed Hypo Alpe's plans to
            spin off a 'bad bank' on concern its liabilities may add to
            Austria's government debt and drive it beyond 80 percent of
            gross domestic product. Chancellor Werner Faymann and Vice
            Chancellor Michael Spindelegger told her to revisit the plans
            after the non-performing assets caused losses and capital needs
            at Hypo Alpe that have burdened Austria's budget. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A bad bank set up as a company without a banking license
            would require it to hold less capital, lowering the need for
            additional state injections. Austrian banks have softened their
            opposition to taking a role in a bad bank, opening the
            opportunity to involve private investors in a similar way as in
            Spain or Ireland. That would avoid the need for the state to
            recognize the liabilities on its balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UniCredit SpA (UCG)'s Bank Austria unit may drop its opposition
            to the plan if a bank levy is cut in return, Chief Executive
            Officer Willibald Cernko said last month. Raiffeisen Bank
            International AG (RBI)'s new CEO, Karl Sevelda, said last week that he
            would look at the proposal according to the principle 'do ut
            des,' citing a Latin phrase meaning 'I give in order that you
            may give.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells Redi Stake to Group of Wall Street Firms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            agreed to sell a majority stake in Redi, a unit that provides
            trading technology, to a group of Wall Street firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The buyers include Bank of America Corp. (BAC)'s Merrill Lynch
            unit, Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA (BNP), Citadel LLC and Lightyear
            Capital LLC, according to a statement today. New York-based
            Goldman Sachs will keep a 'significant minority equity stake'
            in the company. Financial terms were not disclosed. Rishi
            Nangalia, who previously co-managed Goldman Sachs's electronic
            trading business development group, will serve as the company's
            chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The diversification of Redi's ownership may make the unit
            more attractive to clients compared with being controlled by a
            single brokerage, according to Jamie Selway, head of electronic
            brokerage and sales at Investment Technology Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman is heading toward a consortium approach,' Selway
            said in a phone interview. 'Clients are more comfortable with
            broker neutrality in the context of independent technology
            providers or consortium of broker dealers. The operation of
            these systems requires a technology culture and can be
            expensive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired the software that formed the basis
            for Redi when it purchased New York Stock Exchange specialist
            Spear, Leeds Kellogg LP in 2000 and has expanded it to handle
            trades in asset classes such as currencies and interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;RealTick &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's plans come about two years after London-based Barclays Plc (BARC) sold the RealTick
            trading platform, which
            lets customers access services from multiple brokers, to New
            York-based ConvergEx Inc. Barclays said in December 2010 that it
            planned to use the system within its investment banking unit and
            offer the platform to customers. The bank got RealTick when it
            acquired parts of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase Co., Knight Capital Group
            Inc. and other securities firms bought execution-management
            systems starting in the mid-2000s to give mutual funds and other
            clients access to exchanges and algorithms, or trading
            strategies that allow them to process larger orders in small
            pieces over a preset period, along with other transaction
            services. Some platforms were open to the algorithms of multiple
            brokers or technology providers while others focused on those
            from a single firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment Technology Group (ITG) and Instinet Inc., a subsidiary
            of Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., offer execution platforms

            trade with their own money. Bloomberg LP, the parent of

        <headline>BofA to Goldman Sachs Lead $30 Billion of Bond Offerings in U.S.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led at least $30 billion of corporate bond
            sales in the U.S. this week, the busiest period in almost two
            months, as relative yields narrowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, sold $2
            billion of 10-year securities and New York-based Goldman Sachs
            issued $2.5 billion at its lowest relative yield for five-year
            debt since the financial crisis, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Offerings increased from $24.6 billion last week and
            were the most since $36.8 billion in the five days ended May 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own company bonds
            rather than government debentures narrowed to 219 basis points
            yesterday from 227 basis points on July 12, according to the
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch US Corporate High Yield index.
            Yields decreased to 3.99 percent from 4.13 percent, and compare
            with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America sold $2 billion of 4.1 percent debt due
            July 2023 at a relative yield of 157 basis points, Bloomberg
            data show. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender will use
            proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,
            according to a person with knowledge of the transaction, who
            asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
            publicly. The debt is rated A- by Standard Poor's, Bloomberg
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bonds Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds rose 0.9 cent today from the issue price to 100.8
            cents on the dollar to yield 4 percent, or a spread of 148.9
            basis points, at 9:09 a.m. New York time, according to Trace,
            the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
            Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold 2.9 percent debentures due July 2018 at
            a relative yield of 155 basis points, its lowest spread on five-year securities since it sold $2 billion of
            5.45 percent notes
            at a 110 basis-point spread in October 2007, Bloomberg data
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities climbed 0.9 cent since the July 16 sale to
            100.8 cents on the dollar to yield 2.72 percent, or a 139.9
            basis-point spread at 9:18 a.m. in New York, Trace data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to at least $25
            billion from $23.1 billion last week and above a 2013 weekly
            average of $21.9 billion, the data show. Offerings of
            speculative-grade bonds reached at least $5.3 billion, compared
            with $1.5 billion last week and a 2013 weekly average of $7.3
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody's
            Investors Service and lower than BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuers planning sales include tobacco processor Alliance
            One International Inc. with a $790 million sale of eight-year
            notes, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Managing Director Nicholas Valtz Found Dead</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Valtz, a managing director
            in cross-asset sales at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in New York,
            was found dead yesterday by family members who went searching
            for him after he didn't return from a kiteboarding outing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valtz, 39, was found in Napeague Harbor near the eastern
            end of Long Island, according to the East Hampton, New York,
            police. He was a 'novice kiteboarder' and was found floating
            in the water secured to his kite, police said in a statement
            released yesterday. Other kite gear was found in a grassy area
            of the harbor, police said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're deeply saddened by this tragedy and our thoughts
            are with Nick's family,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman for
            Manhattan-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valtz, who joined the firm in 2000, was promoted to
            managing director in 2010. As a cross-asset sales executive, he
            helped manage orders for trading clients and pitch them products
            and ideas among different types of securities. His wife, Sashi
            Valtz, also works at Goldman Sachs as head of global third-party
            research sales, according to her LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Andrew Valtz was born in September 1974 and
            received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1996,
            according to New York voting records and Harvard's website. The
            school lists him as earning letters in fencing for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Police are still investigating the death, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hybrid Sport &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kiteboarding is a convergence of windsurfing and
            paragliding that has attracted technology executives including
            Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Also called
            kitesurfing, it propels riders across water at speeds as fast as
            40 miles per hour (64 kilometers per hour), on boards about 4
            feet to 5 1/2 feet long (1.2 meters to 1.7 meters). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For steering, a crossbar is connected to the kites with
            lines. Using waves as ramps, riders can vault 10 feet to 40 feet
            out of the water and often spin before landing. They can stop by
            pushing the crossbar to deflate the kite, or by ditching in the
            surf. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In March 2008, Valtz shaved his head to raise money for
            childhood cancer research, according to the website for St.
            Baldrick's Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valtz enjoyed technology products and fast cars, according
            to the website for his brother-in-law's 2012 wedding in which he
            was a groomsman. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Wins $14.6 Million in Singapore Investor Clash</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was awarded
            about $14.6 million by a London judge in a dispute with a
            Singapore-based investor over shares it held as collateral on a
            loan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James Hong Gee Ho, former executive director of Blumont
            Group Ltd. (BLUM), who'd initially sued Goldman Sachs for failing to
            get the best price on his shares after a margin call, was
            ordered to pay the money by Judge David Mackie today. The amount
            included principal and interest on the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong was one of several Singapore executives who got into
            payment disputes with Goldman Sachs after shares of Blumont,
            Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. (LIGO) plunged during a stock
            rout in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong didn't appear in court after Goldman Sachs's legal
            team notified a law firm that had represented him that Goldman
            would ask to have the case dismissed, said Rebecca Loveridge, a
            lawyer representing the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The law firm that had represented Hong, Wiggin LLP, didn't
            return a telephone message and Hong didn't respond to an e-mail
            sent to Blumont's office in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loveridge said Hong's lawsuit was a 'tactic' to delay
            paying the money he owed. She said Hong hadn't shown any
            interest in continuing the claim and a question had arisen about
            whether Wiggin continued to represent him. His original suit
            against the bank said Goldman Sachs failed to obtain the best
            price for his shares, Loveridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Ludicrous' Figure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs vigorously denied those claims,' Loveridge
            said. 'There was never any dispute that he entered into that
            agreement.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge declined to order Hong to make a payment toward
            an estimated 1 million pounds ($1.7 million) in fees and costs
            that Loveridge had requested because he said Goldman Sachs's
            lawyers hadn't presented evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That figure was 'ludicrous,' Mackie said. 'You want the
            court to make an order of a million pounds? There's been no
            trial.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong stepped down as an executive director on July 20 for
            personal reasons, Blumont, which invests in minerals and energy,
            said in a statement dated July 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is James Hong Gee Ho v. Goldman Sachs
            International, case no. 14-17, U.K. High Court of Justice,
            Queen's Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BES Rises as Goldman Sachs and D.E. Shaw Disclose Stakes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo SA, which has
            slumped since disclosing accounting irregularities at an
            affiliated company, rose the most in a week after Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) and D.E. Shaw Co. bought stakes in the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Portugal's second-biggest bank by market value increased as
            much as 20 percent to 50 euro cents and traded at 47.9 euro
            cents as of 4:29 p.m. in Lisbon trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs holds a 2.8 percent stake in Banco Espirito
            Santo after acquisitions July 15 and D.E. Shaw, a New York-based
            hedge-fund firm, owns 2.7 percent of the stock as of July 14,
            according to separate regulatory filings from Banco Espirito
            Santo yesterday after the market close. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that it 'entered into positions
            in Banco Espirito Santo by virtue of its facilitation of client
            transactions,' according to an e-mail sent to Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This purchase passes on some security to the market and
            can open the door for other institutional investors,' said Juan
            Dieste, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo will probably raise private funds to
            boost capital, Bank of Portugal Governor Carlos Costa said July
            18, saying talks with investment banks and investors indicate
            interest in the lender. The bank has lost about half its market
            value since disclosing May 20 that there were 'irregularities
            in the accounts' of a related company, Espirito Santo
            International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Costa has also tried to reassure depositors and investors
            that Banco Espirito Santo can withstand any losses that may
            result from Grupo Espirito Santo, which indirectly controls a 20
            percent stake in the bank. The concern stems from two companies
            within that group missing payments on commercial paper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo has hired Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to provide
            advice on how to strengthen its balance sheet, the bank said in
            a regulatory filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Ogunlesi Lead Director as Schiro Retires</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
            Adebayo O. Ogunlesi as lead director of its board after James Schiro retired to undergo treatment for
            multiple myeloma. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogunlesi, chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners who
            joined Goldman Sachs's board in 2012, also will lead the
            corporate governance, nominating and public responsibilities
            committee, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
            Ogunlesi, 60, was previously head of the risk committee, a role
            that will be filled by Michele Burns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs gave expanded responsibilities to its lead
            independent director last year, including setting the board's
            agenda and writing a letter to shareholders in the annual proxy
            statement, as part of an agreement with an investor to drop a
            proposal that called for an independent board chairman. Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein also serves as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jim Schiro defined what an effective lead director is
            through a strong model of corporate governance, and I intend to
            follow his extraordinary example,' Ogunlesi said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Multiple myeloma is a cancer in white blood cells that
            disproportionately affects older people. About 100,000 people in
            the U.S. are diagnosed each year with blood cancers, including
            leukemia and lymphoma, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
            Control and Prevention in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schiro, 68, a former CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and
            Zurich Financial Services AG, joined Goldman Sachs's board in
            2009. He also resigned today from the board of PepsiCo Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogunlesi, who was born in Nigeria, previously was head of
            global investment banking at Credit Suisse Group AG before his
            current role at Global Infrastructure Partners, a private-equity
            firm. GIP manages about $18.7 billion and has led an acquisition
            of Gatwick Airport Ltd. in the U.K. and had a stake in
            Australia's Port of Brisbane. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Burns, formerly the chief financial officer of Delta Air
            Lines Inc. and CEO of the Retirement Policy Center, has served
            on the board of directors since 2011. She was head of the
            board's audit committee, and will be replaced in that role by
            Apple Inc. CFO Peter Oppenheimer, who joined the board in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's board of directors now has 12 members, nine
            of which are designated as independent. The lead director is
            elected by the independent members. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, ADIA Said to Weigh Joining Gavea in Snagged Fleury Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s private-equity arm and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are
            considering
            joining Gavea Investimentos Ltda. in a bid for Brazilian
            medical-services company Fleury SA (FLRY3), people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In joining Gavea, the two investors would be wading into a
            bid for a company that has been on the market for more than six
            months. Fleury, which has a market value of about 2.6 billion
            reais ($1.2 billion), said in March that it was in exclusive
            talks with Gavea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal has been held up, as Gavea's partners in Instituto
            Hermes Pardini Ltda. -- a closely held medical lab company that
            would be merged with Fleury -- have sought a greater role in the
            combined company, three people said, asking not to be identified
            discussing private information. It's still possible that a deal
            won't be reached, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rising incomes in Latin America's most populous country
            mean more people are leaving the public health system in favor
            of private care. That's prompting investors to seek ways to
            profit from the growing pool of health-care consumers, spurring
            deals including the takeover of Amil Participacoes SA by
            UnitedHealth Group Inc. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Fleury, Gavea, Goldman Sachs, ADIA and Hermes
            Pardini declined to comment. Gavea, JPMorgan Chase Co.'s
            Brazil private-equity and hedge-fund unit, owns a 30 percent
            stake in Hermes Pardini. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Sao Paulo-based Fleury have retreated 10 percent
            this year as the deal has dragged on. Amid the negotiations,
            Fleury also posted a net loss in the fourth quarter and missed
            sales estimates, further dragging on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pardini Family &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pardini family, which controls Hermes Pardini, wants a
            higher valuation for their company and a greater role in running
            the combined business, the people said. Aurea Pardini, a member
            of the family, recently retained financial adviser Greenhill
            Co., while other Pardinis are working with Moelis Co. to
            negotiate those points, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The family stake at Hermes Pardini could be valued at 1.5
            billion reais, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Itau BBA SA is lining up a four-bank syndicated loan
            for Gavea, Goldman and ADIA, one person said. JPMorgan Chase
            Co. is advising Core Participa''es SA, the holding company that
            controls Fleury. Any acquirer of Fleury would have to make an
            offer to buy out the minority shareholders' stakes at the same
            price paid to the controlling stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Itau, Greenhill, and Moelis declined to
            comment. Exame earlier reported that the Pardini family is
            holding up the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Asks Goldman to Break Down Trading Revenue by Product</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
            Commission asked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to disclose how much
            products such as mortgages and commodities contribute to its
            trading revenue to give investors more clarity on how the firm
            makes most of its money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it will give 'additional qualitative
            disclosure' of the revenue by product types, according to
            correspondence with the regulators released today about the New
            York-based firm's 2012 annual filing. The SEC indicated it was
            satisfied with that response. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's institutional client services division,
            which includes stock and fixed-income trading, generated 53
            percent of the firm's revenue last year. Like most of its
            competitors, Goldman Sachs only provides a single revenue line
            for fixed-income trading, which includes products ranging from
            Treasuries to distress bonds and uranium. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC noted that the firm produced a third of its revenue
            from market-making and made the request 'in light of its
            significance.' Goldman Sachs said that its quarterly filings
            includes a breakdown of some revenue by product. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The data include market-making and 'other principal
            transactions' revenue reported through the firm's investing and
            lending unit, which houses the company's own investments. It
            excludes trading commissions and net interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $4.37 billion from interest rates,
            $5.51 billion from credit and $5.8 billion from equities,
            according to the data. It lost $1 billion from currencies, while
            producing $575 million from commodities and $1.97 billion from
            'other.' The breakdown doesn't reflect how the firm runs its
            business, Goldman Sachs said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said in Talks to Settle FHFA Mortgage Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks to settle a U.S. regulator's claims the investment bank
            sold faulty mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and will probably pay $800 million to
            $1.25 billion, according to a person briefed on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high end of the
            range would be on par with the agreement Morgan Stanley (MS) reached this year after being sued over a
            similar amount of mortgage bonds as New York-based Goldman Sachs. The final amount may change as an
            agreement is reached, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the settlement talks are
            private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Housing Finance Agency sued 18 banks in 2011 seeking to recoup
            taxpayer costs from when the government took control of the failing mortgage-finance companies in 2008.
            Seven banks, including JPMorgan Chase Co. and Deutsche Bank AG, agreed to pay a total of almost $8 billion
            last year to settle claims they made misrepresentations about mortgages underlying securities bought by
            Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the lead-up to the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $800 million figure
            would surpass Goldman Sachs's $550 million payment in 2010 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission
            suit over the marketing of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, Goldman's cost could be lower than what rival banks paid, as a percentage of the face value
            of securities bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA said in its original suit that the two
            companies bought $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs, and an $800 million settlement would be 7.2 percent of
            that total. Some banks have settled at amounts that represented between 12 percent and 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan, BofA &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley in February agreed to pay $1.25 billion as part
            of a settlement over $10.6 billion in securities. JPMorgan agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle
            claims related to about $33 billion in mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. in March
            announced a $9.5 billion accord, including paying $6.3 billion in cash to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and
            buying back $3.2 billion of mortgage bonds from them. The housing finance companies bought about $57 billion
            of bonds from Bank of America and its predecessor firms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for
            Goldman Sachs, didn't return messages after normal business hours seeking comment on the possible range of
            costs, which was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal. Stefanie Johnson, an FHFA spokeswoman, said
            the agency wouldn't comment on the Goldman Sachs case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Denise
            Cote in Manhattan has set a Sept. 29 trial date for Goldman Sachs. All but four of the FHFA cases have
            settled, Cote said yesterday in a ruling. The remaining cases involve Goldman Sachs, HSBC North America
            Holdings Inc., Nomura Holding America Inc. and RBS Securities Inc., she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs said earlier this month that it set aside $284 million in the second quarter for litigation and
            regulatory proceedings, up from $149 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
            have taken $187.5 billion in U.S. aid and have returned more than $200 billion under terms of their federal
            conservatorship. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Denies Ex-Employee Claims of Sex Bias</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) denied
            gender bias in compensation and tolerating a 'boys' club'
            atmosphere of excessive drinking and strip-club trips as it
            sought to quash a bid to unite female associates and vice
            presidents in a class action for discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rejected claims by former employees Cristina
            Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, opposing their court request to
            expand a lawsuit to represent more than 2,300 current and former
            female associates and vice presidents who worked at Goldman
            Sachs in the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'To be clear: Goldman Sachs does not tolerate
            discrimination of any kind,' the firm said in papers filed July
            25 in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster and Orlich, who sued in 2010, claim they have
            expert statistical analyses that showed a pattern of
            discrimination against women in earnings and promotions. They
            alleged that the bank tolerated a work environment where women
            are treated as 'second-class employees.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 36 percent of professionals employed by New York-based Goldman Sachs are women, the firm said
            on its website,
            citing August 2013 figures. Women constitute 23 percent of
            officials and managers, and 21 percent of executive and senior
            officials and managers, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Percentages &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former Goldman Sachs employees cited their own
            percentages in court filings. They claimed female vice
            presidents earned 21 percent less than men, and female
            associates made 8 percent less. About 23 percent fewer female
            vice presidents were promoted to managing director relative to
            their male counterparts, they said in their complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs asked U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to
            rule that Chen-Oster and Orlich should pursue their claims
            individually, rather than as representatives of all female
            Goldmans Sachs associates and vice presidents. Plaintiffs have
            more leverage in class actions because they can pool legal
            resources, more easily forcing a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank argued that the women haven't shown a general
            policy of discrimination or evidence that women were affected
            negatively as a class. Their allegations are individual claims
            that don't apply to the other women, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Denials &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also specifically denied many of the allegations
            in the complaint, including claims that male employees took
            clients to strip clubs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm said it prohibits employees from business outings
            involving 'sexually oriented entertainment, such as
            entertainment at topless bars or lap-dancing bars.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also submitted statements from female
            employees who said they haven't been discriminated against or
            subject to harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm said it has conducted diversity training programs
            for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have never heard anyone even mention the
            possibility of going to a strip club,' Samantha Davidson, an
            extended managing director, said in a written declaration. 'I
            do not feel excluded from social events, such as events with
            clients and informal get-togethers after work with co-workers,
            including golf events.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs Co., 10-cv-06950,
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firm Intervale
            Capital LLC is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to seek
            buyers for Proserv Group AS, a supplier of equipment for
            undersea oil drilling, according to people familiar with the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First-round bids for the business, which could be valued at
            about $750 million, are due this month, the people said, asking
            not to be identified discussing a private matter. The group is
            attracting interest from other private-equity investors and
            Goldman Sachs is offering financing to potential buyers, one of
            the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dealmaking is picking up in the energy-equipment sector as
            a growing amount of oil and gas production comes from deepwater
            and unconventional reserves, which require extensive
            infrastructure to exploit. Last month Canadian engineering group
            SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) agreed to pay about $1.97 billion for
            Kentz Corp. (KENZ), which supplies apparatus and engineers for energy
            projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives from Goldman Sachs did not immediately
            return requests for comment via e-mail and telephone. Intervale
            did not return an e-mail seeking comment outside of regular
            business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Intervale, a specialized oil and gas services investment
            firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, first invested in
            Proserv in 2009. Aberdeen, Scotland-based Proserv had earnings
            before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about $70
            million last year, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Prices Its Biggest Australian Bond Sale Since 2011</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised
            A$750 million ($680 million) in its biggest Australian bond sale
            in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five-year debt transaction was priced to yield 170
            basis points more than swaps, according to Goldman Sachs
            spokeswoman Hayley Morris. The bank sold A$450 million of fixed-rate notes and A$300 million of
            floating-rate securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street lender that generates most of its revenue
            from trading last sold similar debt in November, when it priced
            A$600 million of bonds with the same tenor at a 195 basis-point
            spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It sold A$1.25 billion
            of notes in May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. was the last U.S. bank to sell bonds
            in Australia, pricing A$850 million of 2018 notes on May 14,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Following record debt
            sales in May, issuance in the South Pacific nation dropped to
            the least since December 2011 last month as concern the Federal
            Reserve will reduce stimulus roiled global markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average spread for financial-company bonds in Australia
            spiked to as high as 130 basis points more than swaps on July 2
            before narrowing to 114 yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            index data show. While the premium is nearing its level before
            Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke spoke about tapering at his June 19
            news conference, issuance has remained muted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs holds the seventh-highest credit rating at
            Moody's Investors Service and Standard Poor's. Bank of America
            carries the same A- ranking as Goldman Sachs at SP and is
            graded two levels lower at Moody's. The 5-1/4 year paper it sold
            in May was priced at a spread of 190 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's Goldman Sachs transaction was managed by the lender
            itself, Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., National
            Australia Bank Ltd. and Royal Bank of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Donald J. Mulvihill, a Goldman Sachs (GS)
            Group Inc. managing director who started the firm's asset-management business in Japan and created
            tax-focused funds in
            the U.S., has died. He was 56. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He died on July 19 at Loyola University Medical Center in
            Maywood, Illinois, 15 months after being diagnosed with
            leukemia, according to his wife, the former Jill Kane. A
            resident of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, he retired from New York-based
            Goldman Sachs on July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a 33-year career with Goldman, the fifth-biggest U.S.
            bank by assets, Mulvihill became a specialist on pension and
            retirement planning, introducing new investment products in the
            U.S. and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Don will be remembered not only for his commercial

            Timothy J. O'Neil and Eric S. Lane, co-heads of Goldman's
            Investment Management Division, wrote in a company e-mail on
            July 19. 'Don was known throughout the firm for his kindness
            and thoughtfulness. He has been, and will continue to be, an

            &lt;p&gt;As president of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Japan Ltd.
            from 1992 to 1997, he dealt first-hand with Japan's 'lost
            decade' of recessions following the collapse of the nation's
            asset bubble in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nasdaq Lowered to Sell by Goldman Sachs on Lower Profit Margins</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
            selling shares of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., saying the company's
            diversification strategy will reduce profit margins and may
            cause the exchange operator to miss earnings forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Blostein cut his rating on
            the second-largest U.S. exchange operator to sell from neutral
            and reduced his price estimate to $28 a share from $30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Street is too optimistic on the firm's operating
            margin outlook as NDAQ's business mix continues to shift toward
            lower-margin revenue streams, creating risks to 2014 and 2015
            EPS estimates,' Blostein wrote in a research note today, using
            the company's ticker symbol. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nasdaq shares fell 2.8 percent to $32.10 as of 9:31 a.m. in
            New York. They have gained 29 percent this year, almost double
            the 17 percent advance in the Bloomberg World Exchanges Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's stock has fallen 2.5 percent since the July
            23 close, before it reported second-quarter earnings the next
            day that missed analyst estimates. It was the first time profit
            came in below expectations in five quarters and only the second
            time in 13 quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The results were hurt by costs associated with acquisitions
            that are part of Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld's
            strategy to diversify the company. In recent months, Nasdaq has
            bought U.S. Treasury trading platform eSpeed and Thomson Reuters
            Corp.'s shareholder-relations business. It also took a 25
            percent stake in Dutch alternative trading system The Order
            Machine, which focuses on options. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Businesses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The moves into new business won't make up for shortcomings
            in other areas, said Blostein, because of the smaller margins.
            In the wake of the eSpeed and Thomson Reuters deals, he
            estimates a 39 percent margin compared with 45 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue at the firm's information services, market services
            and listings businesses, which together comprise 83 percent of
            Nasdaq's 2012 sales, have been flat over the last two years,
            Blostein wrote, citing 'challenging trading trends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While other businesses have a blended profit margin of 58
            percent, the former Thomson Reuters unit acquired by Nasdaq
            means 'the firm's Tech Solutions business continues to gain
            share of the overall revenue pie, with only 7 percent operating
            margin.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blostein said Goldman Sachs's models suggest Nasdaq's
            expenses in 2014 will be on average 3 percent higher than
            current analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blostein's call is the only sell rating on the stock among
            18 analyst opinions compiled by Bloomberg. Nine rate the stock a
            buy and eight have hold ratings. The average 12-month price
            estimate is $34.57 a share. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Offers Aluminum to Clients Stuck in Queue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) offered to
            speed up delivery of aluminum to users of the metal and proposed
            changes to industry rules amid claims that its warehouse unit
            created shortages and drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So far no client has accepted the bank's offer to swap
            their metal stuck in queues for immediately available aluminum,
            Goldman Sachs President Gary D. Cohn, 52, said today in a CNBC
            interview. Consumers should have priority over other clients in
            getting aluminum out of warehouses and the London Metal Exchange
            system needs more transparency, Goldman Sachs said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We feel horrible for consumers if they can't get metal,'
            Cohn said. 'We don't believe that to be the fact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The beverage industry has complained that banks and other
            warehouse owners are manipulating aluminum supplies and slowing
            deliveries to drive up the price. Goldman Sachs said that while
            longer queues in recent years have been a factor in the premium
            of physical metal over the spot price, the waits are not driving
            up the price of aluminum, which has fallen since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a recognition of a longstanding problem in the
            market that needs to be solved,' said Diego Valiante, head of
            capital markets at the Center for European Policy Studies in
            Brussels. 'Clearly there is also the understanding of the
            urgency in solving this issue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Premiums Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Detroit, New Orleans, the Dutch port of Vlissingen, the
            Belgian city of Antwerp and Malaysia's Johor have the longest
            waits for metal, according to Barclays Plc. Detroit is dominated
            by Goldman Sachs's Metro International Trade Services LLC, while
            Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)'s Pacorini Metals has the most storage
            units in Vlissingen, New Orleans and Johor. In Antwerp, it is
            NEMS, a unit of Trafigura Beheer BV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aluminum for delivery in three months fell 13 percent this
            year on the LME as stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the
            exchange neared a record. The premiums added to the LME price
            surged to a record 12 cents to 13 cents a pound in June, almost
            double the 6.5 cents in the summer of 2010, according to data
            from Austin, Texas-based researcher Harbor Intelligence. The
            surcharge fell for the first time this year in the week ending
            July 19, according to Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Glencore, the largest owner of LME warehouses, declined to
            comment through a spokesman. Trafigura continues to offer prompt
            delivery of metal to its customers, an official at the
            Singapore-based commodities trader said. Henry Bath warehouses,
            owned by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), don't currently have queues,
            according to a person familiar with the business who wasn't
            authorized to comment and requested anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Costs Inflated &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's offer is 'great news and any pricing
            manifestations due to warehousing issues will hopefully resolve
            going forward,' said Bart Chilton, a member of the Commodity
            Futures Trading Commission. 'This entire matter continues to
            raise the larger issue of banks owning physical commodities,
            warehousing and delivery mechanisms.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Costs were inflated by $3 billion worldwide in the past
            year because of the backup in aluminum supplies, Tim Weiner, a
            global risk manager at brewer MillerCoors LLC, told a U.S.
            Senate panel last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has secured metal directly from producers to
            be able to swap with end-user clients, Cohn said. The firm has
            made the offer at the LME spot price with no premium, according
            to a person briefed on the talks who asked not to be named
            because the offers were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Considered Selling &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are consulting with the metals trade and industry on a
            proposal to amend the delivery out obligations of warehouse
            companies with long queues, and we encourage market users to
            contact us with their views,' Miriam Heywood, a spokeswoman for
            the LME, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In February 2010, Goldman Sachs bought Romulus, Michigan-based Metro International Trade Services
            LLC, which as of July
            11 operated 34 out of 39 storage facilities licensed by the LME
            in the Detroit area, according to exchange data. Goldman Sachs
            said in today's statement that it isn't involved with the daily
            management of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earlier this year considered selling Metro,
            according to a person briefed on the discussions. The bank must
            sell the company within 10 years of its purchase, it said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last week that it plans to get out of the
            business of owning and trading physical commodities ranging from
            metals to oil, days after a Senate panel questioned whether
            banks are abusing their ownership of raw materials to manipulate
            markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Incentives Offered &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn said that while his firm will sell Metro at the
            'appropriate time,' it doesn't have plans to exit other
            commodity businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Commodity hedging is a core competency and one of the
            most important things we do in the firm, and our clients really
            need us to be in that business,' Cohn said. 'We are staying in
            the commodity-hedging business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Low interest rates have encouraged some investors to buy
            and store aluminum with the intent of selling it at a later
            date, Goldman Sachs said in its statement. Warehousing
            companies, which don't own the metal they hold, offered
            incentives to attract supply, according to research from Societe
            Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many market participants have sought to move metal to non-LME warehouses, where storage rates are
            lower, prompting the
            longer queues, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to Greenspan Catch Equity Acrophobia in Flat July</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Calling for a correction in equities at the right time is about as easy as brushing your teeth with
            your mustache. Yet that didn't stop many market watchers in July as U.S. benchmark indexes clung to records.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Alan Greenspan, a fear of heights spread this month as
            the Standard Poor's 500 Index closed in on its third year without a significant dip. The benchmark gauge of
            volatility reflected the concern, with the VIX jumping 34 percent for its biggest monthly gain since January
            yet still holding well below its lifetime average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many potential catalysts were
            proffered. However, as the final trades of the month hit the tape, none of them have yet proven to be the
            smoking gun. An interest rate spike caused by the slow drain of the Federal Reserve punch bowl? Treasury
            10-year yields held pretty flat below 2.6 percent. An oil shock as the world goes up in flames? Both West
            Texas Intermediate and Brent crude lost more than 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wait! Corn is poised
            for its biggest monthly decline in almost three years! What calamity could be causing this 13 percent drop
            and is it the catalyst everyone's been waiting for to knock the chip off the stock market's shoulder? Well,
            as Bloomberg News describes it, the reason for the drop is 'expectations supplies will be ample amid an
            outlook for a bumper harvest in the U.S., the top grower.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK fine. Whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long Time &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main rationale for many of the correction predictions is based
            on the logic that, well, corrections happen. And we haven't had one in a long time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet
            the fundamentals are sort of getting in the way. U.S. gross domestic product surged 4 percent last quarter,
            earnings are up 10 percent for the SP 500 companies that have reported results for the latest quarter and
            sales have increased 4.9 percent. Signs of growth sent the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index up 1.9 percent in
            July, its biggest monthly gain in a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile across the pond, euro-area
            government bonds were up for a seventh straight month and headed for their longest streak of gains in nine
            years after weak data signaled the European Central Bank will have to soldier on with stimulus. The Stoxx
            Europe 600 Index is headed for a 1.8 percent July drop, its worst month since January, while the MSCI
            Emerging Markets Index is up 1.5 percent in July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Yield Curve &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;And
            not all was flat in the Treasury market. Thirty-year bonds had a nice rally, while five-year notes fell.
            That sent the yield spread, or curve, between them to the lowest since 2009. That is likely a sign that
            people are taking this whole Fed tightening thing seriously, if not necessarily worried about inflation.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stocks are falling pretty sharply this morning as the month draws to an end, and there
            are new catalysts to blame: the Bank of Portugal's order that Banco Espirito Santo SA must raise capital;
            Argentina's default; a handful of lousy earnings reports from some big names. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten-year
            Treasury yields surged 10 basis point yesterday and took an early jump today, then came back down to make a
            cool Sears Tower formation in the daily chart. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today's drop has left the SP 500 down
            about 0.6 percent for July, which would mark its first monthly decline since January. However, dips have
            been bought reliably, so check back at the end of the day to see where the chips fall for July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It does make you wonder if this is the beginning of the correction that will fulfill all the pundit
            prophecies? Who knows. One thing is sure: people will likely obsess over it in August, just like they did in
            July. Oh, and in June too... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Investors and analysts of all shades and sizes are
            obsessed with the idea of a correction,' Birinyi Associates Inc. wrote in a note to clients at the end of
            June. 'We have always held that these efforts to foretell a correction are in vain.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway,
            come to think of it, there are some people who could brush their teeth with their mustache if they want:
            those with dentures. Hey, no one said coming up with market metaphors was any easier. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Scherr Strategy Head as Chisolm Retires</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
            Stephen Scherr as the firm's chief strategy officer to replace
            Andrew Chisholm, who's retiring after 29 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scherr, 50, will remain head of Latin America in addition
            to the new role, according to an internal memo today from Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary Cohn.
            David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed
            the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's strategy since the financial crisis has been to
            remain in the firm's primary businesses even as some competitors
            more aggressively exit areas of trading. While Goldman Sachs has
            cut costs and assets, Blankfein has said he won't risk missing
            out on the opportunities of a rebound in trading activity for
            short-term gains in profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earned an 11 percent return on equity last
            year, higher than peers while one-third of the returns it posted
            before the financial crisis. Cohn said last month that the
            current environment is 'abnormal' and features trading clients
            that are the least active in years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scherr's role will include seeking opportunities for
            revenue growth even if broader market conditions don't improve
            in the near term, said a person with direct knowledge of the
            assignment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Gets Ecuador Gold as Correa Steps Up Cash Hunt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador, one of only eight countries
            to adopt the U.S. dollar as its official currency, swapped gold
            with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for liquid assets in a sign the
            nation is short on cash, according to Loomis Sayles Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It does raise a red flag,' Bianca Taylor, a sovereign
            analyst who helps oversee $210 billion at Loomis Sayles, said
            yesterday in a phone interview from Boston. 'Whenever a country
            needs to sell or monetize its gold reserves, it's definitely a
            signal that the sovereign is strapped for cash.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa is stepping up his search for
            financing at home and abroad after borrowing more than $11
            billion from China since defaulting on $3.2 billion of foreign
            debt five years ago. Ecuador's use of the dollar means it can't
            finance deficits by printing money like other countries. Correa,
            a self-described revolutionary socialist, is now planning to
            raise about $700 million in an overseas bond sale this year and
            agreed to allow the International Monetary Fund to perform an
            economic review for the first time since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador's central bank, stripped of its autonomy in a
            constitutional referendum a year after Correa took power in
            2007, says it 'invested' the gold with Goldman Sachs in return
            for assets that can be liquidated within seven days. The country
            will get the same quantity of gold back three years from now and
            expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million from the
            deal, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Productive Asset &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The operation didn't imply any payment of financing costs
            by the central bank to Goldman Sachs, the bank said today in an
            e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. The central
            bank said it also doesn't need the liquidity to finance
            spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
            causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
            generate profits,' the central bank said in the statement on
            its website disclosing the operation. 'These interventions in
            the gold market represent the beginning of a new and permanent
            strategy of active participation by the bank, through purchases,
            sales and financial operations, that will contribute to the
            creation of new financial investment opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry said yesterday the deal wasn't a sale
            and was a normal operation of investing reserves for profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Puzzling Transaction' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction covers 466,000 ounces of gold, according to
            the central bank. That's 1,165 gold bars, worth about $580
            million at yesterday's prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A clue to the operation came last week, when the central
            bank reported a $605 million drop in its gold reserves to $493
            million during the week ending May 23. Net currency reserves
            rose by $434 million. At the time the central bank didn't
            explain the change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's not clear what Goldman Sachs plans to do with the
            bullion, said George Gero, a vice president and precious-metals
            strategist in New York at RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's really a puzzling transaction,' Gero said yesterday
            in a telephone interview. 'The idea that there was a large sale
            and you don't know when it will come out into the market is
            probably pressuring prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Venezuela Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spot gold prices had fallen for five straight days before
            today, when they rose 0.1 percent to 1,244.96 an ounce as of
            2:31 p.m. in New York. They're still down 34 percent from a peak
            of $1,900.20 an ounce in September 2011. Prices have gained 3.6
            percent so far this year and will fall to $1,240 by the end of
            the year, according to the median estimate of 34 analysts
            surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money managers cut their net-long position, or bets on
            higher gold prices, by 24 percent in the week ended May 27,
            based on U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Short
            holdings, or bets on a gold-price decrease, surged 72 percent,
            the most in six months, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
            provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
            gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, which wasn't completed, would have carried an
            interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
            interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
            to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
            margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
            dollars if it rose, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador's transaction with Goldman Sachs 'has nothing to
            do' with the proposed Venezuelan deal, the central bank said in
            its e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Financing Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador will probably use the transaction proceeds to
            finance public spending, said Martin Castellano, a senior
            economist for Latin America at the Institute of International
            Finance, a trade association of banks and money managers
            including Goldman Sachs. Given the country's use of the
            greenback as its official currency, the government needs to
            ensure it has enough liquidity to avoid balance-of-payment
            problems, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The measure reflects the government's willingness to
            pursue whichever financing option is at hand in order to avoid a
            fiscal adjustment,' Castellano said yesterday in a telephone
            interview from Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Public Finance Executive Kathleen Brown to Retire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Kathleen Brown, who helped lead
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s municipal finance business after
            serving as California's state treasurer, is retiring after 12
            years with the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown, 67, was chairman of investment banking for the
            Midwest, according to a memo from Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, the firm's co-heads
            of investment
            banking. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based
            bank, confirmed the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Kathleen has played an integral role in building the
            firm's public sector and infrastructure franchise,' the memo
            reads. 'She has developed trusted relationships with many of
            the firm's clients and has led many important transactions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown ran the firm's West Coast municipal finance team
            until 2010, when she moved to a newly created post in Chicago
            and helped lead the public finance unit in the Midwest. The move
            came in part to avoid any conflict of interest after her brother
            Jerry Brown was elected California's governor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown's father, Edmund 'Pat' Brown Sr., also served as
            governor and Brown herself was the 1994 Democratic nominee,
            losing to Pete Wilson. She served as treasurer of the state from
            1991 to 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown worked at Bank of America Corp. before joining
            Goldman Sachs in 2001 with its private wealth management group,
            according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswires reported Brown's retirement earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ecuador Used Gold Reserves for Goldman Sachs Loan Collateral</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador President Rafael Correa said
            proceeds from a loan obtained from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            after he offered more than half the country's gold reserves as
            collateral will go toward investing in economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government, faced with a budget deficit forecast to hit
            a record this year, said last week that it 'invested' 466,000
            ounces of gold with Goldman Sachs in return for 'instruments of
            high security and liquidity.' The transaction added to reserves
            of 'monetary gold' and would generate as much as $20 million
            in profit, according to a central bank statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gold reserves 'serve as collateral for a loan,'
            Correa told reporters today at the presidential palace in Quito.
            'With this loan, we can invest in the country.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, amounting to 1,165 gold bars worth about $580
            million at current prices, comes on top of government attempts
            to sell about $700 million of bonds this year in what would be
            the nation's first foreign debt sale since it defaulted on $3.2
            billion of its notes in 2008 and 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador's government hasn't sufficiently explained the
            operation with Goldman Sachs and the difference between the
            central bank's original statement and Correa's comments today,
            said Luis Fernando Torres, a congressional representative for
            Tungurahua province. The government has liquidity problems and
            has begun delaying payments to some public officials, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An investment and a loan are two totally different
            things,' Torres said today in an interview at the nation's
            Congress in Quito. 'This operation is baffling.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;$10 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Correa's administration is also in talks with China to
            finance a $10 billion refinery in the coastal province of Manta,
            Strategic Sectors Minister Rafael Poveda said today at the event
            in Quito. The government expects to sign a deal for $2 billion
            in August, of which $500 million will be for the government's
            discretionary use, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry forecasts the government will need
            about $4.94 billion to cover this year's budget deficit. The
            government has said that if it doesn't find the funds to finance
            the gap, it will cut spending on budgeted infrastructure
            projects. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Credit Suisse Rises on Goldman Upgrade</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Switzerland's
            No. 2 bank, rose the most in two weeks after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) raised its recommendation to buy from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts also raised their recommendation for
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to neutral from sell, citing the decline in its
            stock and its plan to issue shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse rose as much as 2.1 percent in trading today
            after Goldman Sachs analysts including Jernej Omahen said its
            shares were among the most undervalued in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rise was the most since Credit Suisse settled a U.S.
            investigation of its role in helping Americans evade taxes. The
            settlement, announced after the close of trading on May 19,
            included a guilty plea and a fine of $2.6 billion. It resolved
            the last major litigation issue for Credit Suisse, Chief
            Executive Officer Brady Dougan said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank 'offers one of the highest upsides amongst
            our coverage,' the analysts wrote. 'We therefore upgrade the
            shares to buy and add it to our conviction list.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse shares were up 1.6 percent to 26.76 francs at
            12:20 p.m. in Zurich. At that price, it would have to rise 36
            percent to reach the analysts' 12-month price target of 36.50
            francs. Goldman Sachs said its view was based on the bank's
            current strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weak share performance, low expectations for profitability
            and low capital ratios are among factors that increase the
            chances of Credit Suisse adjusting its strategy, Goldman Sachs
            said. Its analysts see more potential for shares to rise if any
            such changes reduce the impact of investment banking on return
            on equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investment Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of Credit Suisse's
            earnings per share for this year to 2.58 Swiss francs ($2.87)
            from 2.73 francs, citing a slowdown in debt trading. The mean
            estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is 2.11 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank is weighing on the company's return on
            equity, the analysts said, estimating the drag at about 5
            percent. Credit Suisse's return on equity, a measure of
            profitability, was 8 percent in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse says its common equity ratio at the end of
            the first quarter would have been 9.3 percent if the U.S.
            settlement were factored in. The bank lags 3.9 percentage points
            behind the biggest Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN) in this measure, Goldman
            Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In our view, an external capital hike remains an option
            for CS,' the Goldman Sachs analysts said. 'Additional source
            of capital generation would be welcome.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Barclays, BofA Fined Over Trading Data</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Barclays
            Plc and Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit were fined $1
            million each for submitting inaccurate information about
            securities trading to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks failed to provide 'complete and accurate
            information' about trading, known as blue sheet data, that
            regulators use to investigate potential insider trading and
            market manipulation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
            said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When firms fail to submit timely and accurate blue sheet
            data, it compromises the ability of every regulator to identify
            the perpetrators of illegal insider trading and other market
            abuses,' said Cameron Funkhouser, the head of Finra's fraud
            detection office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finra said the violations included submissions that failed
            to include some customer names, contained incorrect names, and
            failed to include some transactions. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and
            Merrill Lynch each has a history of inaccurate blue sheet data,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs and Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Bank of America, based
            in Charlotte, North Carolina, declined comment. A spokesman for
            London-based Barclays didn't immediately respond to an e-mail
            seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms didn't admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Pledge $500 Million to Alibaba as IPO Looms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will lend
            $500 million to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as the company seeks
            $8 billion of loans, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pledge by the New York-based bank forms part of a
            facility that will cut debt costs for China's biggest e-commerce
            company, the people said yesterday, asking not to be identified
            because the details are private. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
            Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alibaba is locking in three- and five-year loan financing,
            introducing a smartphone operating system and buying a stake in
            China's biggest Twitter-like service -- steps considered a
            prelude to an initial public offering that may value the company
            at as much as $100 billion. Investment banks are keen to form
            relationships with Alibaba to increase their chances of being
            selected to help with the share sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs wants to use this as an opportunity for
            further chances of cooperation,' including the IPO, said Alex Wang, a Beijing-based analyst at Internet
            consulting group
            iResearch. 'These banks might not come across a chance like
            this in years.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Alibaba, said
            he had 'no comment on speculation regarding who may have joined
            the syndication' when asked about the company's financing
            plans. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UBS Defies Goldman Call for Brazil Rally on World Cup Win</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            both say that Brazil will probably win its sixth World Cup title
            next month. They have opposing calls on the market's reaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman cites historical data for past winners to
            predict a victory for the national team will spark a rally for
            Brazilian stocks, UBS said in a report today that local politics
            mean a defeat could spur gains by further eroding the popularity
            of President Dilma Rousseff's government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks posted the biggest rally among the world's
            major stock indexes today after a poll showed declining support
            for Rousseff ahead of October elections in which she'll seek a
            second four-year term. Investors are betting that a new
            president will interfere less in state-controlled companies such
            as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, bolstering their prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the national team 'crashes and burns' in the Cup, or
            if the tournament suffers a major organizational catastrophe,
            widespread social discontent could ensue,' Jorge Mariscal, the
            chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth
            Management, wrote. 'However, short-term economic pain and anti-Dilma sentiment could be good for financial
            markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The elections, expectations for a Brazil victory as well as
            an 'unstable' social situation evident in street protests over
            $11 billion in spending tied to the games, make this year's
            tournament especially important for markets, UBS said. In
            addition to how well the team fares, Rousseff's popularity could
            also be hurt by traffic jams and other problems that expose
            Brazil's lack of preparation, Mariscal said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors should get ready to carefully follow
            developments not only inside the soccer stadium, but also on the
            streets of Brazil's largest cities,' UBS said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Call &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs recommended buying Brazilian assets in a May
            28 report, saying history shows a win will boost the country's
            stock markets in the weeks after the final. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The victor country's equity markets outperform global
            stocks by 3.5 percentage points in dollar terms on average in
            the first month after winning, 'although the outperformance
            fades significantly after three months,' according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS, which looked at the winning nations' stock markets in
            local currency terms since the 1974 World Cup, said the winner
            underperformed global equities in the week after the final in
            six of eight times, with a median underperformance of 0.7
            percent. Considering one-month returns after the World Cup, the
            median nation outperformed by 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the analysts are split on the effect of a win on the
            country's assets, they agree that Brazil is likely to get a
            record sixth title at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium next
            month. UBS called the team as the 'clear favorite,' joining
            Goldman, Danske Bank A/S and Unicredit SpA, who all predicted
            the host team will beat Argentina in the final match. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Support Slips &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rousseff's support fell to 34 percent this month from 37
            percent in May, according to a Datafolha poll published today on
            Folha de Sao Paulo's website. All of Rousseff's challengers
            together garnered 35 percent, a gap from the front-runner that
            is within the two-percentage-point margin of error in the June
            3-5 survey. To win in the first round a candidate needs to have
            more than 50 percent support, or more votes than all other
            candidates combined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ibovespa jumped 3 percent today in Sao Paulo as state-run companies surged after the poll
            results. Petrobras, as the
            state-controlled oil producer is known, added 8.3 percent to
            17.68 reais, the biggest one-day advance since March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A decade ago, Roberto Setubal set out to challenge Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setubal
            was chief executive officer of Banco Itau SA, one of Brazil's biggest retail and commercial banks. At the
            time, investment banking in the country was dominated by U.S. and European firms, with Goldman Sachs the
            perennial leader in advising on mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The single Brazilian bank
            competing with the outsiders was Banco Pactual SA -- and it was bought in 2006 by Zurich-based UBS AG

            &lt;p&gt;Setubal launched his quest by acquiring a small rival, Banco BBA Creditanstalt SA, in 2003. He
            renamed it Banco Itau BBA SA and told its CEO, Fernao Bracher, that his job was to dislodge foreign banks
            from their perches atop the investment-banking ranks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setubal opened the coffers of
            Banco Itau, now Itau Unibanco Holding SA, to help Bracher do it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'By maintaining Itau
            BBA as a different company, we kept the sophistication, agility and flexibility in decision making of an
            investment-banking boutique and at the same time gave this boutique the power to use the huge capital base
            of Itau,' Setubal, 58, says. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells Biggest Topix-Tied Note Since December 2010</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $85
            million of notes tied to the Topix index of Japanese stocks, the
            largest such offering since December 2010, after increasing the
            size twice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The six-month securities, $15 million of which were most
            recently issued on June 4, yield the gains and losses of the
            benchmark with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus
            filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The New
            York-based bank sold the first $50 million offering on March 21
            and $20 million more on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's stocks have gained the most among developed markets
            this year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to beat
            deflation and the Bank of Japan embarked on unprecedented
            stimulus measures. The central bank plans to buy more than 7
            trillion yen ($71 billion) of bonds a month to increase
            inflation to 2 percent within two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As Japan continues to pursue these policies, it is
            helping to bolster domestic and foreign interest in their stock
            market,' said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist in
            New York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Topix, as the Tokyo Price Index is known, climbed 29
            percent to 1,111.97 this year as of the close of trading on June
            10. The Standard Poor's 500 Index, the most common equity
            benchmark tied to U.S. structured notes, rose 15 percent to
            1,642.81 during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank estimated the value of the original offering as
            98.9 cents on the dollar, a prospectus filed with the SEC shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bigger Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There have been two larger offerings tied to the Topix
            index since 2010, when Bloomberg started collecting
            comprehensive data on structured notes. The biggest, $174.2
            million of 16-month notes, was issued by the Scandinavian lender
            Eksportfinans ASA on Dec. 8, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
            York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB), the Turkish
            banks in talks to sell a stake to Qatar Islamic Bank, said it
            hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) as exclusive financial adviser on
            the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Istanbul-based lender said in March that it was in
            exclusive talks with QIB for a strategic partnership, while the
            Doha-based bank said it was interested to take a stake in the
            lender. Bank Asya, in today's filing, didn't give more details. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merger and acquisition activity in Turkey's banking
            industry is increasing as international rivals seek to tap the
            country's economic growth. Industrial Commercial (1398) Bank of China
            Ltd. agreed to buy 76 percent of Turkey's Tekstil Bankasi AS (TEKST) for
            $316 million in April, while a Bank Asya takeover would be the
            second by Qatari investors after Commercial Bank of Qatar bought
            Alternatifbank AS (ALNTF) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank Asya fell 2.9 percent to 1.66 liras at 10:35 a.m. in
            Istanbul. It's gained about 14 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB), the Turkish
            bank in talks to sell a stake to Qatar Islamic Bank, said it
            hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as a financial adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was hired after a board meeting to be the
            Istanbul-based lender's financial adviser in relation to its
            'strategic partnership,' Bank Asya said today in a statement,
            without providing further details. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank Asya said in March that it was in exclusive talks with
            QIB for a strategic partnership, while the Qatari bank said it
            was interested in taking a stake in the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank Asya was founded by followers of Fethullah Gulen, the
            U.S.-based Islamic cleric blamed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the corruption probe that
            implicated members of his
            cabinet. The bank's shares have climbed 62 percent since talks
            with QIB were announced on March 25, after slumping following
            the investigation that became public on Dec. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merger and acquisition activity in Turkey's banking
            industry is increasing as international rivals seek to tap the

            Istanbul, cutting its market value to 1.5 billion liras ($723
            million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank Asya last week issued a statement denying unspecified

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Ruling After Dragon Systems Deal Trial</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s missteps
            advising speech-recognition pioneer Dragon Systems Inc. in a
            merger weren't egregious enough for the bank to be found in
            violation of a Massachusetts law, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris in Boston, citing a jury
            verdict in January that rejected a $580 million negligence suit
            filed by Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker and two other
            shareholders, denied the plaintiffs' request for claims against
            Goldman Sachs under the state's Unfair Trade Practices statute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge called the investment banking team assigned to
            the all-stock sale of Dragon to a Belgium competitor in 2000
            'professionally negligent' because it didn't fully vet buyer
            Lernout Hauspie Speech Products NV, which collapsed in an
            accounting fraud rendering the deal worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The reasons why small startup companies like Dragon go to
            a place like Goldman to assist with hatching their golden eggs
            is because they don't have their own expertise to analyze
            revenue projects by asking tough questions to potential merger
            partners,' the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Still, I give weight to the fact that the jury found for
            the defendant on this claim and there was sufficient evidence to
            support that finding even if I conclude otherwise,' Saris said
            in yesterday's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bakers' attorney, Alan Cotler of Reed Smith LLP, said
            yesterday in an e-mail that his firm was still studying the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday in a statement it was pleased
            the judge respected the jury's unanimous verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Jury's Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The evidence showed, and the jury concluded, that the
            banking team satisfactorily performed its role for Dragon
            Systems in all respects,' the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bakers, who started Dragon in 1982 in their Newton,
            Massachusetts, home, along with shareholders Robert Roth and
            Paul Bamberg, lost about $300 million along with the
            intellectual property, the judge found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Plaintiffs may have been brilliant mathematicians and
            scientists, but they had no financial experience with mergers
            and acquisitions,' Saris said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman team was lead by Richard Wayner, then 31, and
            included two bankers in their 20s, and a technology strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge found Wayner should have spoken up at a key
            Dragon board meeting and told members that Goldman Sachs wanted
            further review of LH's revenue figures in Asia, which were
            later revealed as a fraud. Instead, Wayner deferred to Janet
            Baker, who was eager to complete the sale and made positive
            comments about the pending deal, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Due Diligence &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At the very least, in my view, the Goldman team should
            have disclosed their continuing due diligence concerns,' Saris
            said. 'However, there is no evidence that their failure to do
            so was egregious.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs argued Goldman Sachs should have told Dragon
            that the bank's own Principal Investment Area considered an
            investment in LH in the late 1990s and decided against risking
            the bank's money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge found none of the bankers on the Dragon deal knew
            about the work known as 'Project Sermon,' and no one at
            Goldman withheld information about why the bank never invested. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LH created bogus customers, booked circular transactions
            with shell companies and recorded loans as sales from 1996 to
            2000, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            probe. Four executives were sentenced to prison for fraud in a
            criminal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Baker v. Goldman Sachs Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S.
            District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Partners Shefter, Freedman Weissman Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partners
            Daniel Shefter, who ran the corporate finance solutions group,
            and Orit Freedman Weissman, the firm's head of Israel, have left
            the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shefter and Freedman Weissman were absent from a list of
            partners released today. Shefter is now an advisory director and
            Freedman Weissman agreed to become an international country
            adviser for New York-based Goldman Sachs, according to internal
            memos earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shefter joined the company in 1996 after working as a tax
            lawyer and became a partner in 2010. Freedman Weissman started
            at the firm in 1993 and established the bank's business in
            Israel a few years later. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed the
            contents of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Eyes Japan Offshore Wind in Clean Energy Expansion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the New
            York-based bank planning as much as 300 billion yen ($3.19
            billion) in renewable energy investments in Japan, is eyeing
            offshore wind power after building up holdings in more
            established clean energy sources such as solar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy Co. was set up by Goldman in August
            after Japan began offering above-market rates to producers of
            clean energy. The incentives, or feed-in tariffs, have spurred
            investments in renewables, setting Japan on course this year to
            become one of the world's largest solar markets by annual
            installations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company sees offshore wind as promising, Shigeru Yasu,
            a representative director at Japan Renewable Energy, said in an
            interview in Tokyo yesterday. Geothermal and biomass power also
            hold potential, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It takes three to four years to do an environmental
            impact study for an onshore wind project with more than 10
            megawatts of capacity,' Yasu said. 'Projects with larger
            capacity are more attractive because an environmental study
            requires the same amount of time even for a 500-megawatt
            offshore farm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Five-Year Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy plans in the next five years to
            invest as much as 50 billion yen directly into clean energy
            projects with capital provided by GS Infrastructure Partners. It
            will take as much as 250 billion yen of loans for project
            financing, Takahisa Nakagawa, also a representative director at
            Japan Renewable Energy, said in the interview. The investments
            and loans will amount to about 1,000 megawatts of clean energy,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wind power is more challenging than solar for a developer
            because it requires prior investment such as an environmental
            impact study, Nakagawa said, adding that his company has the
            advantage of having people with expertise in wind power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's offshore wind market -- 31 megawatts in cumulative
            capacity -- lags behind countries like the U.K. and Denmark with
            3,093 megawatts and 923 megawatts of capacity, respectively,
            according to 2012 data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Offshore wind typically requires approval from local
            fishermen before projects can move ahead and costs more for
            installation and maintenance than onshore wind. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy is considering more than 300
            megawatts worth of solar projects, Nakagawa said. The company
            will use panels by LS Industrial Systems Co. (010120), a South Korean
            electric and industrial equipment maker, at least for its first
            four plants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Panel Supplier &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LSIS was picked because it offers quality products for less
            compared with Japanese makers and because panels aren't the only
            product the company produces, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are big pureplay solar panel companies that went
            bankrupt and that's worrisome,' Yasu said. 'Even though a
            company offers 20 years of warranty, it's no good if the company
            won't be around 20 years later.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan is set to overtake Germany as the world's largest
            solar market, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developers may install 6.9 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts of
            solar in Japan in 2013, the London-based research agency said.
            Germany led solar installations in 2012 with 7.6 gigawatts of
            capacity. Cumulative global solar energy installations reached
            102 gigawatts for the first time in 2012, according to
            preliminary BNEF data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) is
            buying the riskiest slice of a commercial-mortgage bond
            transaction for the first time as sales soar of debt tied to
            skyscrapers, hotels and shopping centers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment manager is teaming with Raith Capital
            Partners, a New York-based real estate debt firm, in purchasing
            the B-piece, designated as the first to take any losses, in an
            upcoming deal from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said two people
            familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be identified
            because it hasn't been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lured by higher returns with the Federal Reserve (FDTR) holding
            benchmark interest rates at about zero percent since 2008,
            AllianceBernstein is joining hedge funds Saba Capital Management
            LP, Ellington Management Group LLC and Perella Weinberg Partners
            LP in making debut B-piece purchases this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in those portions traditionally included real
            estate specialists such as Rialto Investments and Eightfold Real
            Estate Capital, which last year purchased 16 of the 27 B-pieces
            issued, according to data from Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives from AllianceBernstein, Raith and Perella
            didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment and
            spokesmen at Goldman Sachs, Saba and Ellington declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities are poised
            to climb by more than 50 percent to $70 billion in 2013,
            according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Banks have arranged about
            $36.6 billion this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Wins Dismissal of $450 Million Mortgage-Bond Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
            dismissal of a suit over $450 million in residential mortgage-backed securities, with a New York judge
            saying that the firms
            that bought the bonds should have done more research beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos dismissed the
            claims against Goldman Sachs today, saying the investors only
            reviewed data presented in offering documents for the securities
            and never asked to review files for the underlying loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The true nature of the risk being assumed could,
            admittedly, have been ascertained from reviewing these loan
            files and plaintiffs never asked for them,' Ramos wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was among financial firms including Bank of
            America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase Co. sued over more than $1.8
            billion in mortgage-backed securities in 2012 by Phoenix Light
            SF Ltd., a company based in Dublin that inherited claims from
            six legal entities 'that collapsed or nearly collapsed,'
            according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The entities include WestLB, the 180-year-old German state-owned lender, based in Dusseldorf, that
            ceased operations in
            2012 as part of European Union conditions tied to a 17 billion-euro ($23 billion) bailout after the 2008
            financial crisis,
            according to a complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
            part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
            worst recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
            and the market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Request &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs said Goldman Sachs didn't share the files
            for the loans underlying the securities. Ramos said there were
            no allegations that that they asked for them and Goldman Sachs
            denied access. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It does not matter if the failure to seek this
            information was because of blind faith in the process of
            origination and/or securitization, or if it was attributable to
            the desire to quickly get on board of what the investors thought
            was a profitable bandwagon,' the judge wrote. 'The obligation
            of a sophisticated investor to inquire cannot be merely
            excused.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nathan Lindell, an attorney with Robbins Geller Rudman
            Dowd LLP representing the plaintiffs in the case, didn't
            immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn't
            immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc., 652356/2013, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former Goldman Trader Sues to Get $20 Million in Bonuses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            trader who helped lead the firm's bets against subprime
            mortgages before the financial crisis asked a court to throw out
            an arbitration ruling denying him more than $20 million in
            unpaid compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem encountered a 'kangaroo court' and a
            'shocking and blatant miscarriage of justice' as Financial
            Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators didn't allow him to
            call some of Goldman Sachs's top trading executives as
            witnesses, he said in a complaint today in New York State
            Supreme Court. Salem, 35, said in the complaint that members of
            the industry-funded regulator's arbitration panel called his
            case 'ridiculous' and 'bulls---' during a hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salem left the firm in May 2012, a year after a U.S. Senate
            subcommittee said he and other Goldman Sachs traders tried to
            manipulate prices of derivatives linked to subprime home loans
            in 2007 for their own benefit. The subcommittee's assertions
            were based in part on Salem's discussion of an attempted short
            squeeze in his self-evaluation, a finding which Salem said 'put
            too much emphasis on 'words,'' according to the Senate report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The three-person Finra arbitration panel said in a March 17
            decision to dismiss his case that even if the witnesses said
            what Salem maintained they would, he hadn't established a
            legally enforceable claim for the bonus money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Employees trade their rights to go litigate in court and
            get smart judges to review their circumstance in exchange for an
            expedited hearing on the merits,' Jonathan Sack, Salem's
            lawyer, said in a telephone interview. 'Deeb Salem got
            neither.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'A Scapegoat' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sack said his client was 'used as a scapegoat' by Goldman
            Sachs after criticism of the firm. Salem left the bank on his
            own accord and started at New York-based hedge-fund firm
            GoldenTree Asset Management LP a few months later. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His arbitration claim seeks $6.15 million in deferred
            compensation, $10 million in 'bonus true-up' for 2010 and
            2011, and $5 million as a pro-rata bonus for his 2012 work. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin Zern, chairman of the arbitration panel, didn't
            return a phone message left at a listed number. Tiffany Galvin,
            a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said the firm
            wouldn't comment on litigation and Finra's Michelle Ong declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Company documents show Goldman Sachs traders in 2007 sought
            to encourage a 'short squeeze' by putting artificially low
            prices on derivatives that would gain in value as mortgage
            securities fell, according to a 2011 report by the Permanent
            Subcommittee on Investigations. The idea, abandoned after market
            conditions worsened, was to drive holders of such credit-default
            swaps to sell and help Goldman Sachs traders buy at reduced
            prices, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Short Squeeze &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting
            very short again,' Salem said in a 2007 self-evaluation
            excerpted in the report. In interviews with the committee, Salem
            denied attempting a short squeeze and 'claimed that he had
            wrongly worded his self-evaluation,' the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Salem v. Goldman Sachs Co., 651811/2014, New
            York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Crop Price Decline Top Commodity Opportunity at Goldman Sachs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The downside potential for
            agriculture prices is the biggest trading opportunity across
            commodity markets for analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as
            production recovers, according a report from the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank recommends initiating a short position for new-crop corn and soybeans, analysts Damien
            Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday. Goldman lowered its
            forecast to $4.75 a bushel for corn and to $11 a bushel for
            soybeans in three, six and 12 months. That compares with a
            previous prediction of $5.25 and $12.50 for six and 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn, soybean and wheat futures that surged as drought cut
            output in 2012 have tumbled into bear markets this year on
            expectations harvests will rebound. Record U.S. corn output will
            more than double inventories before the harvest in 2014, and
            soybean production will be an all-time high, the U.S. Department
            of Agriculture said June 12. Corn futures are the second worst-performing commodity on the Standard Poor's
            GSCI gauge of 24
            raw materials this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While U.S. corn and soybean production levels remain
            uncertain, we still expect that production will recover relative
            to last year's level under most weather outcomes,' the report
            said. 'It will require a significant weather shock to limit the
            rebuild in corn and soybean inventories given the record large
            realized South American harvests and current weak global
            consumption.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank recommended a basket short two December 2013 corn
            contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade and short one November
            2013 soybean contract as it sees a lower soybean to corn price
            ratio under most weather outcomes, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we may be too early in entering this trade, we
            prefer that to being late given our belief that current prices
            embed a large weather premium and that prices could decline in
            the next six weeks,' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Rating Lowest Ever in Calm-Market Casualty</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The big trend among the young and
            restless in New York this summer is to bash Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. interns on Yik Yak, an anonymous social-media app. The big
            trend for analysts covering Goldman is to bash the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average rating on Goldman Sachs shares has fallen to
            3.21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that assigns a
            score of 5 to ratings of buy or the equivalent, 3 to holds and 1
            to sells. Apart from some similar scores earlier this year,
            Goldman's rating has never been lower in data starting in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Here's a sample of the ribbing the summer associates are
            taking on Yik Yak: 'GS interns clap when the plane lands.'
            Here's a sample of what analysts are saying about Goldman Sachs:
            Trading revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies
            will drop 16 percent this quarter, according to Sanford C.
            Bernstein Co.'s Brad Hintz, who on June 5 cut his second-quarter earnings estimates by 8 percent to $3.35 a
            share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The slump in Goldman's ratings, not to mention the 6
            percent drop in its stock this year, is a casualty of the
            pervasive calm that has overtaken financial markets and sent
            measures of volatility in various asset classes to multi-year,
            if not record, lows. Citigroup Inc. has warned of a drop of as
            much as 25 percent in second-quarter trading revenue and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Never Move' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn said at an investor
            conference last month: 'What drives activity in our business is
            volatility. If markets never move or don't move, our clients
            really don't need to transact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts on average predict Goldman's earnings per share
            before unusual items will slide 16 percent this quarter, 2
            percent next quarter and 9 percent in the final three months of
            the year before rebounding 8 percent in all of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's 3.21 analyst rating ranks the stock 68th among 83
            financial stocks in the SP 500 and 14 percent below the average
            3.72. Banks less reliant on trading revenue are faring better.
            JPMorgan Chase ranks 11th among financials with a 4.3 rating;
            Citigroup's is 4.1; Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Co. are
            each at about 3.9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For the entire SP 500, Goldman's consensus rating ranks it
            440th and 16 percent below the average of 3.84. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman's shares outperformed the benchmark stock
            index by more than 9 percentage points in 2013 and 28 percentage
            points in 2012, its 139 percent return including dividends is
            far behind the SP 500's 220 percent return and an almost 300
            percent jump for financial shares since the start of the bull
            market in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You can't blame the summer interns for that. Even if,
            according to Yik Yak, they all wait for the light to change
            before crossing the street. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Egyptian Twinkies Maker Said Set to Hire Goldman Sachs for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Edita Food Industries, the Egyptian
            snacks maker part-owned by buyout firm Actis LLP, is close to
            hiring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to help manage its initial
            public offering, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, whose products include the Twinkies cake in
            Egypt, may appoint a second bank to assist on the expected share
            sale in Cairo, the people said, asking not to be identified as
            the information is private. The IPO may be valued at about $300
            million, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egyptian companies are reviving share sales as they seek to
            benefit from a more than 20 percent gain in Egypt's benchmark
            EGX 30 index this year. A $110 million IPO of Arabian Cement
            last month, the country's first since the 2011 uprisings,
            received $1.5 billion in bids from institutional and individual
            investors, according to EFG-Hermes Holding SAE. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edita is the largest independent snack food business in
            North Africa, Actis said in June 2013 when it bought a $102
            million stake in the company. Representatives at London-based
            Actis and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Edita officials did
            not immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs 100-Year Bond Pitch Captivates Colombia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;After helping Mexico sell 100-year
            bonds overseas for the first time in 2010, Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. is seeking to do the same for Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Andean nation may issue the notes later this year after
            the New York-based bank offered to arrange the sale, Finance
            Minister Mauricio Cardenas said June 11. Goldman Sachs helped
            underwrite Mexico's offering of dollar bonds due 2110 as well as
            its pound-denominated century bonds in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia is seeking to exploit soaring demand for its
            longer-maturity debt as its economy grows twice as fast as the
            regional average and the Federal Reserve reiterates that
            interest rates will stay low for a 'considerable time' after
            it stops buying bonds. Yields on Colombia's $2 billion of bonds
            due in 2044, its longest-term notes, have plunged 0.67
            percentage point to 4.98 percent since they were issued Jan. 21.
            That's more than the average 0.48 percentage point decline in
            long-dated bonds with the same rating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Colombia shines in the midst of underperforming economies
            in emerging markets, and investors are noticing,' Mario Castro,
            a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc, said by phone from New
            York. 'There's no doubt there's appetite for Colombia risk, and
            Colombia would be getting long-term financing at still very low
            yields.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn't answer calls and messages seeking
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'General Receptiveness' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia would use funds from a sale to cover its 2015
            financing needs, Cardenas told investors at the June 11
            presentation. Goldman Sachs proposed a reference yield of around
            5.7 percent for a Colombian 100-year debt offering, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on Mexico's $2.68 billion of bonds due 2110 have
            fallen 0.67 percentage point this year to 5.55 percent, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mexico, whose BBB+ rating from Standard Poor's is one
            level higher than Colombia's, is the only nation to have issued
            100-year notes in both dollars and pounds. China and the central
            bank of the Philippines sold $100 million of century bonds in
            1996 and 1997, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has been a general receptiveness to longer
            maturities recently,' Michael Roche, an emerging-market
            strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said by telephone from New
            York. 'Institutional investors, particularly pension funds and
            insurance companies, generally have a need for longer
            duration.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growth Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's economy will grow 4.5 percent this year,
            compared with an average expansion of 2.7 percent in Latin
            America, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
            The economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a
            year earlier, the national statistics agency said today, higher
            than the 5.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,882.50 per dollar at the
            close today in Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country's sale of 30-year bonds in January attracted
            $4.2 billion in bids, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government plans $3 billion in overseas debt offerings
            next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Appetite for Colombia's last bond sale was huge, and that
            shows there definitely is willingness to invest in the
            country,' said Nomura's Castro. Selling a century bond would be
            'another step in positioning Colombia in the international
            capital market. It's an exclusive club.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to Buy RCO Tollway Stake as ICA Seeks Cash</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*), Mexico's largest
            construction company, will sell its minority stake in a Mexican
            tollway operator to partner Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and use the
            proceeds to pay short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mexico City-based builder said it expected to receive
            5.07 billion pesos ($380 million) from the sale of its 18.7
            percent stake in Red de Carreteras de Occidente, which is
            majority-owned by Goldman Sachs. The deal needs approval by
            Mexico's antitrust regulator and the Ministry of Communications
            and Transportation, ICA said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICA shares have tumbled more than 30 percent since May 16,
            the day before Moody's Investors Service downgraded the
            company's credit rating citing its high leverage and delays in
            public-works spending by President Enrique Pena Nieto. The
            company's sales dropped 27 percent in the first quarter while
            debt climbed 14 percent to 54.2 billion pesos from its Dec. 31
            level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are significantly strengthening our financial
            position,' ICA Chief Executive Officer Alonso Quintana said in
            the statement. 'The sale of ICA's investment in RCO is a clear
            example of our strategy of selective recycling of capital in our
            asset portfolio and creating value for ICA's shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICA fell 2.8 percent to 21.28 pesos at 9:18 a.m. in Mexico
            City as Mexico's benchmark IPC index dropped 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Moncler Said to Pick Six Firms Led by Goldman, BofA to Run IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Moncler picked six securities firms
            led by Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
            manage an initial public offering as soon as this year,
            according to three people with direct knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offering may raise 800 million euros ($1 billion) to 1
            billion euros as investors sell 30 percent to 35 percent of the
            company, one person said. Mediobanca SpA (MB) will also be a global
            coordinator of the IPO, while Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP), JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) will be joint bookrunners along with the
            global coordinators, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified before the company makes an announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moncler is planning an IPO in Italy for the second time in
            two years, allowing French private-equity firm Eurazeo to reduce
            its stake after it bought 45 percent of the company in 2011 when
            the maker of ski jackets abandoned the earlier listing. The
            purchase, in which Eurazeo replaced Carlyle Group as Moncler's
            largest investor, valued the clothier at no less than 1.2
            billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An external spokeswoman for Eurazeo and a spokesman for
            Milan-based Moncler, Domenico Galluccio, declined to comment on
            the IPO plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moncler may separate the luxury apparel brand from its
            other clothing businesses ahead of the IPO, Chairman Remo Ruffini said in an interview in October. In
            addition to selling
            $1,395 ski jackets and $995 handbags under the Moncler brand,
            Moncler also owns the Marina Yachting, Henry Cotton's and Coast
            Weber Ahaus sportswear labels, and holds the license for
            Cerruti 1881. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Tokyo-based foreign exchange salesman Wako Ogawa is leaving the
            firm,
            according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogawa, 44, a vice president at Goldman Sachs Japan Co.,
            will leave the firm later this year to join a financial
            institution, the people said, declining to be identified because
            the matter is confidential. Goldman Sachs's Tokyo-based
            spokeswoman Hiroko Matsumoto declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogawa, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2007, regularly appears
            as a commentator on TV Tokyo (9413)'s early morning financial news
            program, 'Morning Satellite.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks globally are seeing income from foreign exchange
            squeezed by a decline in market volatility as global central
            banks provide unprecedented liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG's Currency Volatility Index, which
            measures the market's expectation of future price swings for
            nine currency pairs, slumped to a record 5.3 percent on June 19.
            The index was as high as 15.8 percent in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranked 10th in global currency trading, up
            from 11th a year earlier, Euromoney reported in its survey of
            the market published this year, with a 2.5 percent share. The
            bank has seen its proportion of transactions shrink each year
            since 2010, the data show. Citigroup Inc. was the leader in the
            latest survey with a 16 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Offers Triple-Recourse Bonds Targeting AAA Buyers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
            marketing a new type of bond designed to give investors access
            to top-rated assets as the supply of covered bonds and other
            high-grade securities continues to shrink. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of notes are
            provisionally rated AAA by Standard Poor's and will be sold
            through FIGSCO Issuer Ltd., SP said in a statement. The bonds
            are secured by fixed-income assets and offer investors three
            levels of protection in the event of default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman is seeking to meet investor demand for the safest
            assets as AAA rated bonds become harder to find in Europe.
            Redemptions of covered bonds and U.K. RMBS are outpacing new
            issues in Europe as cheap central bank funding and regulatory
            pressure prompt lenders to trim balance sheets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The current context of the supply/demand imbalance in the
            markets is well known,' Societe Generale SA analysts led by
            Jean-David Cirotteau said in a report. 'A new senior secured
            bond backed by a portfolio of financial assets by a large U.S.
            investment firm is probably a good thing for hungry investors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Ramsay, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
            declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The collateral backing the AAA bonds will be transferred to
            FIGSCO through a total return swap with Goldman Sachs Mitsui
            Marine Derivative Products LP, a joint venture between the U.S.
            bank and Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., according to
            SP. The securities offer investors a claim on the assets
            backing the deal, as well as on Goldman and Mitsui if the joint
            venture defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has set up a 10 billion-euro program to sell
            the debt. Goldman Sachs, Barclays Plc, Credit Agricole SA,
            Natixis, and UBS AG are holding investor meetings for the bonds
            this week, a person familiar with the matter said June 23. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top
            merger adviser this year, is combining its health-care and
            retail investment-banking groups amid a boom in deals involving
            pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kathy Elsesser and Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, co-heads of
            the retail team, will lead the new group with Marshall Smith,
            who runs the health-care unit, according to an internal memo
            obtained today by Bloomberg News. David Wells, a spokesman for
            New York-based Goldman Sachs, confirmed the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have been seeking to boost efficiency as
            lower trading revenue and new capital rules damp returns. The
            combined group would be among the bank's largest by total
            investment-banking fees, trailing financial institutions and
            financial sponsors, according to data from New York research
            firm Freeman Co. covering the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The change will allow bankers to 'be deployed more widely
            across a broader client base,' Goldman Sachs's co-heads of
            investment banking, Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, wrote in the memo. 'We see
            growing convergence
            between sub sectors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser this year on deals
            involving health-care companies, which this quarter announced
            about $200 billion of deals, the most ever, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The firm ranked second for retail deals,
            behind Morgan Stanley, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsesser started working for Goldman Sachs in 1989, while
            de Mallmann and Smith joined in 1993 and 2005, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an adviser to Allergan Inc. on Valeant
            Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s $54 billion hostile
            takeover bid, as well as to medical-device maker Covidien Plc on
            its $46 billion acquisition by Medtronic Inc. On retail deals,
            the firm is advising Safeway Inc. on its $9.1 billion sale to
            Albertsons LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. praised the U.S. Supreme Court after a ruling
            today that struck down a federal law that denies benefits to
            same-sex married couples. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is good for our company and clients, but more
            importantly, it's the right thing to do,' JPMorgan Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement from the New
            York-based bank, the largest in the U.S. by assets. 'The rights
            of all people are important and must be protected.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court overturned by a 5-4 majority the U.S. Defense of
            Marriage Act, rejecting many of the justifications for treating
            same-sex and heterosexual couples differently. The court also
            reinstated a judge's order allowing gay marriages in California,
            the nation's largest state by population. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest financial firms have criticized
            prohibitions of same-sex marriage, saying the measures could
            make it harder to recruit staff. Insurer Chubb Corp., which
            highlights the benefits it offers to domestic partners, said in
            2011 that DOMA 'imposes burdens' on businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Marriage equality lowers burdens and challenges imposed
            on employers, and will lead to building successful businesses
            and a strong American economy,' New York-based Goldman Sachs
            said in an e-mailed statement. 'We strongly support the Supreme
            Court's affirmation today of marriage equality.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>GE Said to Hire Goldman Sachs for Sale of CareCredit Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. (GE) is seeking
            buyers for its CareCredit health-care financing division in a
            sale that may fetch $1 billion, according to two people with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to solicit
            bids, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
            the process is private. Second-round bids for CareCredit, part
            of GE Capital, were submitted about a month ago, one of the
            people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Selling CareCredit would extend Chief Executive Officer
            Jeffrey Immelt's efforts to shrink GE Capital as he boosts
            profit from industrial products such as locomotives and jet
            engines. GE Capital faces heightened regulatory scrutiny from
            the Federal Reserve, which identified it as a potential risk to
            the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, declined to
            comment in an e-mail. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman
            Sachs, didn't immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CareCredit is the largest issuer of consumer health-care
            financing in the U.S., according to the New York Attorney
            General's office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE Capital had $538 billion in assets as of March 31,
            larger than all but six U.S. banks, according to data compiled
            by the Fed. The unit's $45 billion in revenue was 31 percent of
            Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE's total sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The potential sale was reported earlier by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
            that was lead underwriter on Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s May bond offering,
            named the technology firm's chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, to its board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer, 51, whose appointment expands the board to 13
            members, is joining immediately and will sit on all four of its
            committees, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, was
            chosen to underwrite the majority of Apple's then-record $17
            billion bond offering last year. It was the Cupertino,
            California-based company's first issuance in 17 years. Apple
            also hired Goldman Sachs in 2012 to help it improve transparency
            and governance, including what to do with its more than $100
            billion in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Peter's 25 years of broad experience across important
            industries will add a valuable perspective to our board of
            directors,' Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) stepped up warnings to shareholders about
            cyber attacks as the U.S. prodded banks and government agencies to bolster their defenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Online
            and mobile banking give new points of entry that can be used to disrupt or penetrate operations, the two New
            York- based firms said last week in annual regulatory filings. The companies said they're vulnerable to
            tactics that overload websites to shut off public access, such as assaults that disrupted the nation's
            largest lenders late last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are speculating that foreign nations,
            organized crime or terrorists are behind efforts to cripple their websites and warning that costs to keep
            intruders at bay will rise. President Barack Obama directed the government on Feb. 12 to develop voluntary
            security standards for companies running vital infrastructure and is pushing Congress to set formal rules.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are going to see more disclosures, and that's a warning sign that things are really
            getting bad,' said Lawrence Ponemon, chairman of Ponemon Institute LLC, a Traverse City, Michigan-based
            security research firm, which predicts a 30 percent increase in expenses tied to cyber intrusions this year.

        <headline>Coverity Talks With Banks Including Goldman About IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Coverity Inc. has held talks with
            banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. about holding an initial public offering later this year,
            Chief Executive Officer Anthony Bettencourt said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company, which makes applications
            to detect errors in software, would look to raise less than $100
            million in an IPO for future acquisitions, Bettencourt said in
            an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coverity is on track for annual revenue of about $70
            million, and sales are growing at 30 percent a year, Bettencourt
            said. More than 1,100 customers, including Microsoft Corp.,
            Samsung Electronics Co. and the National Aeronautics and Space
            Administration, license Coverity's tools, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our eye is on the public markets,' Bettencourt said.
            'It helps with the credibility. It's nice to have a war chest
            in reserves.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Justin Perras, a spokesman at JPMorgan, declined

            &lt;p&gt;Coverity raised $22 million from Foundation Capital and
            Benchmark Capital in 2008, and currently has $25 million in the

        <headline>Goldman's Brazil Investment-Bank Chairman Said to Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Wainstein, chairman of
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Brazil investment-banking business,
            will leave the company, two people with direct knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been discussing the changes with
            Wainstein for the past several months, according to a person at
            the New York-based firm who asked not to be identified because
            the decision hasn't been announced. Wainstein, 42, and Andre Laport Ribeiro are Goldman Sachs's only
            partners in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein asked to leave after working at the firm since
            2000, one of the people said. He was appointed chairman of
            Brazil investment banking in April 2012, when Antonio Pereira
            and Fabio Bicudo were named co-chief operating officers. The
            bank ranked sixth in equity underwriting in Brazil last year,
            with $732 million in transactions, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. It was No. 8 among merger advisers with $14.3 billion in
            deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
            comment on Wainstein's departure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in October it would double capital in
            Brazil to 800 million reais ($407 million) while closing its
            asset-management business in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm, which doesn't disclose Brazil revenue or profit,
            named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country a year ago. Goldman
            Sachs has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on complex
            products with higher profit margins, such as convertible debt
            and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Local Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
            based companies such as Bradesco BBI SA, Banco Itau BBA SA and
            Banco BTG Pactual SA, which have used their stronger local
            contacts to squeeze out foreign firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
            service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
            local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
            Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
            Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
            an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
            back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
            BTG went public last year in a $1.94 billion initial offering
            that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the
            World Bank said they will invest $132 million to push banks in
            developing economies to lend to women-owned businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money will fund a new facility run by the World Bank's
            private-sector arm that will extend lines of credit and share
            risks with local banks to ensure they give female entrepreneurs
            access to financing for their small and medium-size companies.
            The two contributors plan to raise an additional $468 million
            from other investors, the World Bank said today in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gender equality is smart economics and a key driver of
            development,' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a
            speech in Washington announcing the partnership today. 'We need
            to do more so that investing in women becomes mainstream by
            businesses and financial institutions alike.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank estimates that women-owned companies face a $300
            billion credit gap, made worse in some countries by unfavorable
            regulation. Closing that gap would raise income per capita
            across the main developing economies, with Brazil and Vietnam
            gaining the most, according to Goldman Sachs research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The World Bank's International Finance Corp. unit will
            invest $100 million in the so-called Women Entrepreneurs
            Opportunity Facility, with Goldman Sachs providing $32 million,

            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to be valued at about $1
            billion, the people said. The J.W. Childs fund holds stakes in
            five companies, including Sunny Delight Beverages Co., Mattress
            Firm Holding Corp. and retailer Brookstone, according to the
            buyout firm's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal is the latest transaction in which private-equity
            managers are giving investors the chance to sell stakes or roll
            them into new vehicles. London-based Argan Capital began talks
            in January to sell holdings in the 425 million-euro ($583
            million) fund it manages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John W. Childs, 72, and Adam Suttin founded Boston-based
            J.W. Childs in 1995. The firm hasn't raised a fund since 2002,
            abandoning efforts to raise another one in 2007, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for Goldman Sachs and Toronto-based CPPIB
            declined to comment. A spokesman for J.W. Childs didn't respond
            to e-mailed requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Friedman Sees Good Time to Buy Companies as Peers Sell</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Richard A. Friedman, head of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s merchant banking division, said he sees
            opportunities to invest in middle-sized companies as some other
            private-equity firms sell their investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'My peers, I see them at conferences, and they talk about
            how it's the greatest selling environment -- I actually think
            it's a good investing environment,' Friedman, 56, said today in
            a CNBC interview. 'We have continued improvement in the
            economy, we have very low interest rates and access to capital,
            and also for the first time, I'd say, in years, our CEOs can
            actually put business plans together with more confidence.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's merchant banking unit makes investments in
            private-equity and real estate assets using client funds and the
            company's own money. The firm's investments are included in its
            investing and lending segment, which produced $4.33 billion of
            pretax earnings in 2013, the most profit of any of Goldman
            Sachs's four business units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has said it's cutting its own stakes in private-equity funds to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, which limits such
            investments. Still, the firm can often make direct investments
            in debt or equity securities with its own money outside of fund
            structures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's merchant banking division has raised more
            than $82 billion for investment funds in corporate equity and
            debt since 1986, according to its website. The bank is
            considering a different strategy than buying large companies to
            take them private, which was popular before the financial
            crisis, Friedman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Not Happening' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What we're looking at is actually buying mid-sized
            companies or making early-stage investments and growing
            companies, as opposed to what happened in 2005 through 2007,
            which was a buying spree of taking companies private,' Friedman
            said. 'That's just not happening anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Friedman said he doesn't expect interest rates to rise in
            the near future. When that happens, it will probably lower
            valuation multiples on companies, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Friedman has worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years
            and was named a partner in 1990. He and Chief Executive Officer
            Lloyd C. Blankfein are the only two executives to sit on the
            firm's management committee since it was created in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's ISS Said to Get Demand for All Shares in IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ISS Holding A/S has demand for all
            the shares being sold in an initial public offering valuing the
            cleaning company at as much as 31.7 billion kroner ($5.8
            billion), according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS, whose owners include Goldman Sachs (GS) Capital Partners
            and EQT Partners AB, sent a message on demand for the sale to
            institutional investors, the people said, asking not to be
            identified while the transaction is on. The company set a price
            range of 140 to 175 kroner a share on March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS, based in Soeborg, Denmark, said on Feb. 18 it would
            raise 8 billion kroner to repay debt. The IPO, the largest in
            Denmark in 20 years, comes amid a revival in investor interest
            in Europe, where the volume of initial sales approximately
            doubled in 2013, compared with the previous year, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offering will also include shareholders Goldman Sachs
            and EQT selling some of their stakes. Nordea Bank AB, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are joint global coordinators, ISS
            said. Lazard is acting as financial adviser to ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS shares are worth buying at 155 kroner, equivalent to a
            valuation of 29 billion kroner, Sydbank A/S said in a note to
            clients today. ISS will announce the final share price no later
            than March 17. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Bicudo, Pereira to Head Brazil Investment Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Fabio Bicudo and Antonio Pereira will become co-heads of the Brazil
            investment-banking business after Daniel Wainstein retired from
            the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira are currently co-chief operating
            officers of the business, the New York-based firm said today in
            internal memos. The contents of the memos were confirmed by a
            Goldman Sachs spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been discussing the changes with
            Wainstein for the past several months, a person at the firm said
            yesterday, asking not to be identified because the decision
            hadn't yet been announced. Wainstein, 42, and Andre Laport Ribeiro are Goldman Sachs's only partners in
            Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein, who asked to leave after working at the firm
            since 2000, was appointed chairman of Brazil investment banking
            in April 2012, when Pereira and Bicudo were named co-COOs. The
            bank ranked sixth in equity underwriting in Brazil last year,
            with $732 million in transactions, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. It was No. 8 among merger advisers with $14.3 billion in
            deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira are members of the board of Goldman
            Sachs Bank in Brazil and serve on the company's management
            committee for the country. Bicudo joined Goldman Sachs in 1999
            and stayed until 2006. He came back to the company in 2010.
            Pereira joined the firm in 1996 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Paulo Leme &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, which doesn't disclose Brazil revenue or
            profit, named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country a year ago.
            Goldman Sachs has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on
            complex products with higher profit margins, such as convertible
            debt and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
            based companies such as Bradesco BBI SA, Banco Itau BBA SA and
            Banco BTG Pactual SA, which have used their stronger local
            contacts to squeeze out foreign firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
            service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
            local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
            Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
            Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
            an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
            back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
            BTG went public last year in a $1.94 billion initial offering
            that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UBS Hires Bank M&amp;amp;A Advisers From Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) hired bank takeover
            specialists Tannon Krumpelman and Doug Simons as Switzerland's
            biggest lender rebuilds its financial-services practice to cope
            with a prolonged dealmaking slump in that industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Krumpelman joins Zurich-based UBS from Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. and Simons comes to the firm from Credit Suisse Group AG,
            according to Greg Kennedy and Steve Pierson, co-heads of UBS's
            financial-services group for the Americas. Krumpelman and Simons
            are managing directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hires are part of a broader overhaul of UBS's
            investment bank, which exited most of its fixed-income trading
            to boost profits. UBS recruited Kennedy and Pierson, who
            previously worked together at Credit Suisse, to oversee a
            makeover of its financial-services coverage out of New York. In
            the past year, the group has cut more than 20 junior people and
            replaced about half of its dozen senior bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We want to be exactly the right size so all of the
            business we are doing is profitable business,' Kennedy said in
            an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There were $95 billion in announced deals for U.S. banks,
            insurance companies, specialty lenders and other financial
            services companies in 2013, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. That reflects a 6 percent drop from 2012, and is less
            than half of the $217 billion in deals announced in 2007, before
            the credit crisis suffocated financial-services MA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The downturn requires a leaner group staffed with
            rainmakers, Pierson said. The turnaround in UBS's financial
            performance has made recruiting easier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank's profit before tax rose to $2.3
            billion in 2013 from $267 million a year earlier on lower
            expenses and higher income, according to a company investor
            presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Krumpelman spent nine years at Goldman Sachs and started
            its small- to mid-sized bank merger practice, advising Bankia SA
            last year on the $883 million sale of its U.S. susidiary, City
            National Bank of Florida. Simons has more than 20 years of
            experience advising large depositories such as BBT Corp. and
            Wells Fargo Co. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Restart Mideast Equity Sales on Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, is
            restarting Middle East and North Africa equity sales in Dubai,
            according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets is hiring Veer Ramlugon as part of the plans, one of the
            people said, asking
            not to be identified because the matter isn't public. Ramlugon,
            who declined to comment when contacted by mobile phone earlier
            this week, previously worked in Middle East equity and equity-derivative sales at Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is joining banks from Renaissance Capital to
            Arqaam Capital Ltd. in expanding coverage in the Middle East and
            Africa as local markets rally and economic growth surges.
            Dubai's benchmark index has advanced the most among 50 of the
            world's largest equity gauges this year with a gain of 23
            percent as the United Arab Emirates' real-estate and banking
            industries recover from a property crash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. was raised to emerging-market status from
            frontier by index provider MSCI Inc. in 2013, potentially paving
            the way for greater foreign investment in the nation. Dubai, the
            Arab world's business hub, is gearing up to host the World Expo
            in 2020 with $8 billion of infrastructure spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring the sheikhdom's debt against non-payment with credit-default swaps was quoted
            at 189 basis points
            at the end of February, the least since the 187 reached in May,
            according to prices compiled by CMA. They traded at 192 basis
            points as of 3:02 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Renaissance, the Russian investment bank controlled by
            billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, is planning to open an office in
            the city to take advantage of the rising demand for assets in
            the oil-rich region, while Dubai-based Arqaam will start trading
            African bonds and derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

            left the firm after 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dombrowski wasn't included on a list of partners in a

            that Dombrowski
            had departed from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The special situations group trades distressed debt and has
            made investments in companies including pizza chain Sbarro Inc.
            The unit is part of investing and lending, which produced $4.33
            billion of pretax earnings last year, the most profit of any of
            Goldman Sachs's four segments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dombrowski joined the firm in 2002, according to employment

            named a partner in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Julian Salisbury became global head of the special

            &lt;p&gt;Wind Point Partners LP is near an
            agreement to sell snack maker Hearthside Food Solutions LLC to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private-equity arm and Vestar Capital
            Partners Inc. for about $1.1 billion, people with knowledge of
            the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal may be announced as soon as tomorrow, said the
            people, asking not to be identified discussing private
            information. BC Partners Holdings Ltd. and Oak Hill Capital

            &lt;p&gt;Hearthside, which makes snacks including pretzels and
            cookies sold under consumer-product companies' brand names, was

            Sachs declined to comment on its interest in Hearthside as did
            Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for Vestar. Marc Hazelton a
            spokesman for Barclays also declined to comment, while officials
            at Wind Point couldn't immediately be reached. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vestar was part of a group of buyout funds that acquired
            Del Monte Foods Co. in a $5.3 billion deal in 2011. Vestar also
            acquired a stake in grocery wholesaler American Roland Foods
            Corp. in August and has owned consumer brands including Birds
            Eye Foods and Celstial Seasonings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chicago-based Wind Point, which manages about $2.8 billion
            of assets, also owns snack food maker Shearer's Foods LLC and
            meat product maker Rupari Food Services Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google Unmasks Patent Accuser in Tangled Goldman Link</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. wanted to find out who was behind a company called Suffolk Technologies LLC that
            accused the world's largest search engine's owner of using its Internet-search technology without
            permission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turns out, the tangled ownership history included big names: Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. and BT Group Plc's British Telecom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tired of fighting sometimes frivolous
            patent-infringement suits that cost millions of dollars in legal fees, companies such as Google and Apple
            Inc. are using ownership questions to help their court cases. Unveiling litigants can get a suit dismissed,
            disclose the real entity behind a case or identify a target for revenge. Even before Suffolk lost its case,
            Google retaliated last year by filing a patent-infringement suit against British Telecom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You
            would think that determining who owns a patent is a pretty straightforward process,' said Stephen Korniczky,
            co-chairman of the intellectual property practice of Sheppard Mullin in Del Mar, California. 'If a patent is
            assigned to a company, then it's recorded with the patent office. The problem really lies in who owns the
            company or entity to whom the patents have been assigned.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google, Cisco Systems Inc.
            and other technology companies have persuaded Congress to consider legislation requiring patent owners to
            disclose the 'real party in interest.' The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is considering rules to make
            public the 'attributable ownership' of a patent. It will hold hearings on the proposal today in Alexandria,
            Virginia, and March 26 in San Francisco. The challenge may be figuring out what those terms mean and what
            information must be disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Send Refunds After Dark Pool Error</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) discovered
            pricing errors in the firm's dark pool trading venue and sent
            checks to customers to compensate for the mistakes, according to
            people with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank sent the money to clients and other Wall Street
            firms that use its Sigma X pool for equity trades made in August
            2011, said the people, who requested anonymity because the
            communications and payments aren't public. Concerns that Greece
            would default on its debt that month led to a sharp decline in
            stock markets and dramatic price swings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the refunds probably weren't large relative to
            Goldman Sachs's trading revenue, the errors show the potential
            risks to operators of dark pools, which were created to let
            major investors trade big blocks of stock without having news of
            the orders move prices. Sigma X is one of the largest dark pools
            in the U.S., accounting for 1 percent of total daily trading in
            January, data from Rosenblatt Securities Inc. show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The refunds were sent to customers whose trades were
            executed at a certain point beyond the national best bid and
            offer, according to one of the recipients. Stock venues in the
            U.S. are obliged to price trades at the NBBO or better. Goldman
            Sachs appears to have taken the action voluntarily. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Backs Up IEX Endorsement With Biggest Market Share</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the biggest broker on the upstart U.S. stock platform created by
            IEX Group Inc., according to a memo IEX sent some clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said last week
            that markets would be well-served if the five-month-old venue achieved 'critical mass.' The dark pool, which
            has ambitions to become an exchange, was built with defenses against the fastest traders. Yesterday, in a
            memo obtained by Bloomberg News, IEX said Goldman Sachs has more than double the volume of the No. 2 broker.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a bit surprising to see a major broker be such an active and vocal supporter of
            IEX early on,' Justin Schack, partner and managing director for market structure analysis at Rosenblatt
            Securities Inc., said in a phone interview. 'It's an important vote of confidence in IEX.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gerald
            Lam, a spokesman for New York-based IEX, declined to comment on the memo or the endorsement from Goldman
            Sachs. Tiffany Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the New York-based firm has no comment beyond last
            week's memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has played kingmaker before in the exchange industry. It was
            an early investor in IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. and was among the firm's largest shareholders when
            it went public in 2005. Atlanta-based ICE, which now owns the New York Stock Exchange, has grown to become
            the world's second-biggest bourse owner by market value at $23 billion. Goldman Sachs was also a shareholder
            of Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which merged this year with Bats Global Markets Inc. to form an exchange
            operator with about 20 percent of American volume. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman M&amp;amp;A Head Cites Faith in Acquirers as 2014 Deal Catalyst</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors' confidence in companies
            making acquisitions is emboldening management to execute deals,
            spurring a mergers and acquisitions boom, according to Michael Carr, co-head of Americas MA at Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shareholders have been embracing the acquiring companies,
            Carr said today at the 26th annual Tulane University Corporate
            Law Institute in New Orleans, signaling faith in the lasting
            value of transactions as well as challenging the conventional
            wisdom that they should brace for a selloff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Public U.S. companies worth more than $1 billion have risen
            an average of 5.2 percent in 2014 the day after announcing they
            are acquiring a target, a reversal from the 1.9 percent one-day
            decline buyers experienced five years ago, according to data
            from Goldman Sachs. Almost 75 percent of acquiring companies
            have gone up following deal announcements in the fourth quarter
            of 2013 and the first quarter this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is all about shareholder sentiment,' Carr said.
            'Shareholders are accepting the companies' view of synergies
            and cost savings, and they're giving a lot more credit than they
            did.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There have been more than 6,500 deals announced globally in
            the year to date, valued at almost $650 billion, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. That's the most volume in the first
            three months of the year since the first quarter of 2007, when
            volume reached $960 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first-quarter volume reflects a 28 percent jump from
            the year-earlier quarter, and a 12 percent increase from the
            fourth quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Strategic Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More companies are shifting toward strategic MA in 2014
            and away from financial engineering, such as share buybacks,
            Carr said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp.'s $45.2 billion agreement to buy Time Warner
            Cable Inc. was the largest announced in the first three months
            of the year, topping a failed hostile bid from Charter
            Communications Inc. Actavis Plc's $21 billion offer for
            drugmaker Forest Laboratories Inc. and Facebook Inc.'s $19
            billion takeover of mobile messaging service WhatsApp Inc.
            followed the cable combination to round out the quarter's top
            three acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's deals have been motivated by 'expansion of
            market presence and consolidation,' rather than many of 2013's
            biggest takeovers, which were 'clean-up trades,' Carr said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp.'s buyout of the remainder of NBCUniversal
            from General Electric Co., and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)'s
            acquisition of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group Plc were two
            2013 deals driven by financial concerns and cheap debt, rather
            than 'building influence in their particular industries,' Carr
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The character of the market feels different than a good
            part of 2013.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Sentiment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Standard Poor's 500 Index has gained more than
            65 percent since September 2011, earnings growth has risen just
            14 percent in the same time period, indicating the market is
            expecting profits to rise from deals, he said. This supports
            deal advisers, who must count on shareholder sentiment to propel
            future acquisitions, Carr said. It's 'very, very hard for MA
            activity to pick up' without that optimism, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comcast's Time Warner Cable acquisition, the largest U.S.
            cable deal since Comcast's $72 billion merger with ATT
            Broadband in 2001, helped propel Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
            Chase Co. to the top rankings for fees for the quarter, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner Cable and JPMorgan
            advised Comcast, according to the press release announcing that
            deal. Bankers earned about $143 million on that merger, the
            third-largest payday for any deal since 2009, according to New
            York-based research firm Freeman Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has advised on 58 deals this year, valued at
            more than $215 billion, followed by JPMorgan's $162 billion for
            59, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs landed in third place for advising on
            $132 billion of deals, it worked on more transactions than
            either bank, at 77. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc rounded out
            the top five. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs President Says Markets 'Ignoring' Risks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
            Gary Cohn said prices in global markets don't reflect the risks
            from geopolitical conflicts such as Russia's annexation of
            Crimea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For the last six to 12 months, markets for some reason
            have been ignoring a lot of the geopolitical risk,' Cohn, 53,
            said in an interview with Canadian television network CBC.
            'Russia, Crimea, Ukraine: this is not the first or newest
            geopolitical risk we've had in the last year or so.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn cited tensions between China and Japan as well as
            continuing violence in the Middle East as risks that haven't
            halted a climb in global equities over the last 12 months.
            Investors with a lot of cash have felt pressure to deploy it,
            preventing a sustained downturn in prices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anytime we get any sell-off in the market, there's new
            investors coming into the market, so we haven't seen that
            repricing,' Cohn said. Investors are saying, 'I've got to put
            cash to work, and maybe these situations are going to be with us
            for a long time, and I can't sit on cash at the bank earning no
            return forever,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, Cohn said the U.S. stock market seems fairly valued,
            given low interest rates and bond yields that will probably
            climb. The Standard Poor's 500 Index has risen 18 percent in
            the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In a lot of respects, owning equities in the world today
            seems like the least risky opportunity for cash out there,'
            Cohn said. 'Each of the alternatives has its own negative
            potential consequences to it, and then you evaluate all the
            alternatives in relationship to each other, and then you end up
            in a scenario where I think equities provide the most upside
            versus the downside.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Quadrangle Said to Prepare Sale of Norway's GET</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Get AS, Norway's second-largest cable operator, is being put up for sale by its private-equity
            owners and may fetch as much as 7.7 billion kroner ($1.3 billion), according to two people familiar with the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s buyout unit, GS Capital Partners, and Quadrangle
            Capital Partners, which bought Get AS in 2007 for 5.8 billion kroner, are sounding out buyers about a sale
            process or potential initial public offering expected to start this year, said the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the deliberations are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get AS, which competes with
            larger Telenor ASA (TEL)'s Canal Digital unit, is the latest cable company to join a flurry of mergers and
            acquisitions as demand for bundled broadband, pay-TV and wireless services increases. Vodafone Group Plc
            (VOD) this month agreed to buy Spain's Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion)
            including debt. Cable tycoon Patrick Drahi's Numericable SA (NUM) is competing with Bouygues SA (EN) to
            combine with Vivendi SA's French mobile-phone unit SFR. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A London-based spokeswoman for
            Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while representatives for Quadrangle and Oslo-based Get didn't respond to
            e-mails requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Quadrangle haven't made a final
            decision on the sale and could decide to retain the business, one of the people said. Get, which offers TV
            and broadband-Internet access, has about 1 million customers in Norway, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension plans and insurance companies. They usually
            charge a management fee of as much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from investments. &lt;/p&gt;

            trade on IEX in October, according to an internal memo from
            RBC's head of global equities, Greg Mills, and the U.S. equities
            chief, Bobby Grubert. Royal Bank also supported the market's
            development while its founders were still employed at the bank,
            according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Bank has positioned itself as a champion of making
            the stock market more fair. It built a software defense known as
            THOR that tries to protect clients' orders from the fastest
            traders. Also, the Toronto-based bank doesn't run a dark pool,
            shunning a common practice among the world's biggest brokerages.
            On broker-owned dark pools, customers' orders are executed
            privately instead of being sent to public exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have always been strongly opposed to predatory trading
            strategies,' according to the memo. 'RBC and IEX are fully
            aligned and have a shared philosophy of creating a fair and open
            market structure for investors and all industry participants.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kait Conetta, a Royal Bank spokeswoman, confirmed the
            document is authentic and declined to comment further. The
            company is Canada's second-largest lender by assets. Neither
            Royal Bank nor any other broker owns a stake in IEX. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Attorney General &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The endorsements of IEX come amid heightened scrutiny of
            the structure and vulnerabilities of the U.S. stock market,
            where more than 50 electronic venues compete to match buyers
            with sellers. 'Flash Boys' by author Michael Lewis, scheduled
            for release next week, in part tells the story of IEX Chief
            Executive Officer Brad Katsuyama, according to excerpts from the
            book. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said last week
            that he's investigating whether exchanges and other venues are
            giving high-speed traders improper advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So far, IEX has captured only a small slice of stock
            trading. Average daily volume increased to 14.7 million shares
            in February from 9.1 million in January, and is about 18 million
            in March, according to IEX. That's less than 1 percent of the
            2014 daily average of 6.9 billion on all U.S. markets, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IEX attempts to declaw high-speed traders by delaying
            reports of order executions by 350 millionths of a second,
            enough to curb the fastest firms. IEX also shuns the use of the
            maker-taker business model, in which exchanges and other venues
            pay rebates to market makers for providing bids and offers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Bank has urged regulators to consider alternatives to
            that system, saying it creates a conflict of interest for
            brokers who may pick a venue because of its rebates rather than
            the best interests of clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Normally Private &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a challenge to other dark pools, IEX last year released
            its normally private regulatory filing that explains how it
            operates. While currently organized as a dark pool, IEX has
            ambitions to officially become an exchange, Katsuyama said
            during an interview with Bloomberg News last year. There are 13
            stock exchanges in the U.S., including the New York Stock
            Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in its memo last week that 'it would be
            best for the overall market if IEX achieved critical mass, even
            if that results in reduced volumes' on Sigma X, the Goldman
            Sachs dark pool. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The founders of IEX worked on their business plan for
            months while still at RBC, according to the RBC memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While it was hard to part with such strong talent, it was
            the right thing to do for our clients,' the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are at the forefront of significant market structure
            reform,' Royal Bank said. 'While we may see other industry
            participants potentially amending their practices based on
            recent developments, our approach as the client advocate has
            been consistent from day one and we will continue to stand by
            this philosophy in the months and years to come.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Must Face Lawsuit Over 2007 Mortgage Bonds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
            persuade a federal judge to again throw out a securities lawsuit
            over residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2007
            after an appeals court overturned an earlier decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in Manhattan,
            who had dismissed the lawsuit by the Police and Fire Retirement
            System of the City of Detroit twice before, ruled yesterday that
            a 2012 appellate decision overturning her findings in a related
            lawsuit had 'significantly changed the landscape.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed
            Cedarbaum's ruling that the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund,
            which had sued Goldman Sachs in 2008, had failed to claim a
            sufficient loss from the investments. The appeals panel also
            threw out her ruling that the fund couldn't represent investors
            in offerings of the securities it hadn't bought itself. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday's ruling follows a New York state appeals court
            decision in January that Goldman Sachs must face fraud claims in
            a $1 billion lawsuit filed by an Australian hedge fund, Basis
            Capital Funds Management Ltd.'s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, over
            collateralized debt obligations sold by the bank before the
            financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, Goldman Sachs reached a $550
            million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission to resolve claims over the marketing of CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Judge Reversed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the federal case, the Detroit pension fund filed a
            separate lawsuit in 2010 on behalf of investors that bought
            securities from the trust for which Cedarbaum had said NECA
            couldn't bring claims. The judge had dismissed the Detroit
            fund's lawsuit twice largely on her determination that it didn't
            adequately allege how Goldman Sachs's purported
            misrepresentations caused any loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the higher court's ruling, 'the fact that PFRS
            received payments throughout the life of the certificates, and
            was arguably aware of the risk that there would not be a
            secondary market for its certificates, is immaterial,'
            Cedarbaum said in yesterday's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is The Police and Fire Retirement System of the
            City of Detroit v. Goldman, Sachs Co., 10-04429, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Saidenberg Moving to Commodities Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            earned a third of its profit from trading last year, moved Guy Saidenberg from head of global
            foreign-exchange trading to allow
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s Kayhan Mirza to assume the job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saidenberg, who was named to the currencies post last year,
            becomes global co-head of commodities trading with Greg Agran in
            June, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a March 28 internal
            memo. That's when Mirza joins as a partner and London-based
            chief of the unit that Saidenberg ran, the bank said in a
            separate memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed
            the appointments and declined further comment, as did JPMorgan's
            Brian Marchiony. Saidenberg declined to comment through an
            associate in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
            investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
            industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
            firm's currency business had 'difficulty managing inventory'
            in the third quarter as the company posted its worst fixed-income trading revenue since the financial
            crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saidenberg joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 on the interest-rate products trading desk and was named a
            managing director in
            2005 and partner the following year, according to the memo. He
            will also continue as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa
            emerging markets trading, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported Goldman Sachs's hiring of Mirza,
            who oversaw JPMorgan's EMEA foreign-exchange trading and was
            global head of FX options trading, on March 5. The Wall Street
            Journal reported Saidenberg's new role earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Salisbury Head of Special-Situations Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Julian Salisbury will become head of the global
            special-situations
            group, a unit that invests the firm's own money and generated as
            much as $4 billion a year before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salisbury, 41, is replacing Jason Brown, who is retiring,
            New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in an internal memo.
            Salisbury will move to New York from London, where he has been
            head of the European special-situations group. Michael DuVally,
            a spokesman for the company, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Special Situations Group, known as SSG, trades
            distressed debt and has made investments in companies from
            Japan's largest golf-course operator to pizza-chain Sbarro Inc.
            In 2011, New York-based Goldman Sachs stopped including SSG's
            results within fixed-income trading, and moved it into a new
            reporting segment called investing and lending that includes
            other proprietary investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's investing and lending division generated $5.89
            billion in 2012, almost triple that of a year earlier. The unit
            gained $1.85 billion from debt securities and loans, and $2.39
            billion from equity securities. The company doesn't break out
            SSG's results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salisbury, a U.K. citizen, was a founding member of the
            European SSG unit in 2003 and was named a partner at the firm in
            2008, according to the memo, which was sent by Pablo J. Salame
            and Isabelle Ealet, co-heads of the securities division. Brown,
            who joined Goldman Sachs from Bear Stearns Cos. in 1999 and
            became a partner in 2006, had led the group from Hong Kong since
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Diversified Portfolio &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jason's leadership has been instrumental in the design
            and execution of a realigned investment approach in GSSG,
            resulting in a diversified portfolio that has shown strong
            performance in both favorable and challenging market
            conditions,' Ealet and Salame wrote in a separate memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the management changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SSG produced $4.1 billion in 2007, 9 percent of the
            company's total revenue. It generated $3.79 billion in 2006,
            according to documents released by a Senate subcommittee in
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has faced questions about whether SSG's
            activities would be crimped by the Volcker rule, which was part
            of the Dodd-Frank Act. Rules about how it will be implemented
            are still being written. The bank has argued that most of the
            unit is a lending business. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Completes Sale of Majority of Reinsurance Business</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold a
            majority stake in its reinsurance business to institutions and
            high-net worth clients as financial firms adjust to demands by
            regulators for more capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is keeping a minority stake in the business,
            named Global Atlantic Financial Group, the New York-based bank
            said today in a statement. The firm didn't disclose the price of
            the private offering or what percentage it retained. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said in January
            that the bank was considering selling a stake in the business
            because international regulators are imposing higher capital
            requirements. The bank at that time disclosed the unit's
            contribution for the first time, saying revenue climbed 23
            percent in 2012 to $1.08 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
            business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
            primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in 2012 to buy Ariel
            Holdings Ltd.'s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
            businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said last month that reinsurance revenue was $233
            million in the first quarter, up from $211 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak
            is facing calls before a weekend election to justify a $3
            billion bond placement by the sovereign-wealth fund he leads,
            with opponents saying the deal was unnecessary and mispriced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs Group Inc. arranged the March 19 sale of 10-
            year debt by 1Malaysia Development Bhd., also known as 1MDB, and
            the notes were priced to yield 4.4 percent, 141 basis points
            more than sovereign Islamic dollar bonds due July 2021 were
            yielding at that time. The 1MDB yield was 3.76 percent today,
            giving investors who were in at the start a return of 5.7
            percent for the six weeks since the debt was issued. U.S.
            Treasuries gained 1.43 percent on average during the period,
            according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The private placement raised too many red flags, coming
            so close to the election date,' said Wong Chen, a 44-year-old
            corporate lawyer and a parliamentary candidate from the
            opposition National Justice Party. 'They were rushing this out
            and they don't know how to spend it. We don't know who received
            this private placement and who they may sell it on to.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Najib is chairman of the board of advisors of 1MDB and the
            March bond sale has given candidates opposing him in the May 5
            polls ammunition to criticize the fund, with Wong calling for
            more transparency. The accusations are part of a smear campaign
            before the voting, according to a government spokesman, who's
            not authorized to be named. Recent opinion polls suggest that
            the election will be tight with the opposition alliance having
            gained support in recent months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            said in a report published today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Kion Targets IPO for 2013 as KKR, Goldman Sachs Monitor Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Kion Group GmbH said it's considering
            an initial public offering this year, the first time the world's
            second-largest maker of forklifts publicly confirmed plans to
            list in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company and its shareholders KKR Co. (KKR) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS), are 'actively monitoring the capital markets
            to decide on the timing of any potential transaction,' company
            spokesman Michael Hauger said in an e-mailed statement today.
            Kion hasn't yet decided on the final timing, he said, adding
            that an IPO would help to 'continue its profitable growth path
            and support its future strategic development.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion was part of German industrial-gas maker Linde AG
            before a 4-billion euro buyout in 2006. Sales increased 8.2
            percent to 4.7 billion euros last year even as global demand for
            industrial trucks dropped by 3.1 percent, as the company
            benefited from orders in China, where Kion is the largest
            overseas forklift-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman Sachs have already lined up banks to handle
            the planned initial public offering of Kion, people with
            knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) was added to the list of financial
            institutions that already includes owners Goldman Sachs and
            KKR's equity capital markets arm as well as Deutsche Bank AG,
            said the people. The IPO will probably happen before July if
            markets remain stable and Wiesbaden, Germany-based Kion may sell
            as much as 25 percent of its stock, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman sold 25 percent of Kion to Weichai Power
            Co., China's biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks, in August to
            help trim debt. Kion also sold 70 percent of its hydraulics unit
            to the Chinese firm. The moves brought Kion 738 million euros
            ($974 million) in investment from Weichai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion trails Toyota Industries Corp., an affiliate of Toyota
            Motor Corp., in the global forklift market. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>WTI-Brent 16-Month Low Pits Goldman Against BofA</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The collapse in the price difference
            between the world's two most-traded crude oil grades is
            fulfilling a prediction Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has held for
            more than a year. Bank of America Corp. says it won't last. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent crude's premium to West Texas Intermediate slumped
            more than 50 percent to a 16-month low in the past two months,
            falling to less than $10 a barrel for the first time since
            January 2012. The differential narrowed to as little as $8.66 a
            barrel today, after rising to a record $28.08 in October 2011.
            Brent was typically cheaper in the past decade, averaging $1.28
            a barrel less than WTI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The spread 'has been extremely volatile, moving one way
            and then another,' said Olivier Jakob, managing director at
            consultant Petromatrix GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. 'The question
            remains of where is the equilibrium price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The divide between Brent, a gauge for more than half the
            world's oil, and WTI, the U.S. benchmark grade, has narrowed as
            North Sea supplies resumed following oilfield maintenance, while
            a switched pipeline began relieving a glut of crude at America's
            oil hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. Credit Suisse AG and Barclays Plc
            said in 2011 that the Cushing gridlock had made WTI so cheap
            relative to Brent, that the U.S. grade was losing its relevance
            as a global benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent has lost 9.6 percent in 2013, trading at $100.45 a
            barrel today on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange,
            after the restart of North Sea oil fields such as Buzzard and
            Elgin-Franklin in March. WTI on the New York Mercantile Exchange
            was at $91.45, little changed this year, as projects including
            Enterprise Products Partners LP and Enbridge Inc.'s Seaway
            pipeline eroded the glut at Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said since February 2012 that the gap
            would narrow, reiterating April 23 that it would shrink to about
            $5 a barrel in the third quarter as refiners in the Midwest
            boost operations after seasonal maintenance work and new U.S.
            supplies from Texas are redirected away from Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The entire balance at Cushing will shift from a small
            surplus into a pretty significant deficit over the next couple
            of months,' Stefan Wieler, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs
            in New York, said in a telephone interview on April 30. 'The
            bottleneck between Cushing, Oklahoma, and the Gulf Coast is
            starting to disappear. There are a number of pipelines that have
            been added, reversed or expanded that will make this happen.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Seaway Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enterprise (EPD) and Enbridge's Seaway pipeline transported
            302,000 barrels a day from Cushing to the Gulf Coast in the week
            to April 26 after flows through the link were reversed last
            year, remote-sensing company Genscape Inc. said yesterday.
            Magellan Midstream Partners LP's Longhorn line, Sunoco Logistics
            Partners LP's Permian Express, and TransCanada Corp.'s Keystone
            XL project are also set to divert crude from Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Bank of America, the narrowing of the spread is
            temporary, with the difference poised to rebound to $21 a barrel
            in the third quarter, according to an April 17 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market knows that this is all coming on stream, and
            is positioned for that,' Sabine Schels, a commodity strategist
            at Bank of America in London, said in an interview yesterday.
            'Our worry is that that production growth will eventually
            outpace the growth in pipeline capacity. And more importantly,
            what are refiners going to do with all that crude?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Refiners on the Gulf coast aren't configured to process the
            additional low-density, or 'light,' crude being produced,
            according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Catch On &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By the end of this year, the market will catch on to the
            fact that we're just going to push the inventories in Cushing
            down to the Gulf coast,' Schels said. 'That should lead to a
            wider spread again.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of America and Goldman WTI-Brent predictions are
            among the most divergent of analyst estimates compiled by
            Bloomberg. The median forecast for the third quarter is about
            $15 a barrel, and $12 for the fourth quarter, according to 36
            analyst predictions for WTI and 38 for Brent. Citigroup Inc. and
            Standard Chartered Bank Plc predict that the gap will end the
            year close to current levels, averaging $10 a barrel in the
            fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While 'U.S. shale oil production is flourishing,' putting
            downward pressure on WTI prices, 'pipelines are being built,
            reversed and expanded to accommodate the growth of local,
            abundant crude supply,' capping the spread, Ed Morse,
            Citigroup's global head of commodity research in New York, said
            in a report on April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hydraulic Fracturing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. crude production climbed to 7.33 million barrels a day
            in the week ended April 19, the highest level since April 1992,
            the Energy Department reported on April 24. Output has expanded
            20 percent in the past year as a combination of horizontal
            drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocks supplies
            from shale formations in North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oil's so-called forward curve, formed by prices for
            successive monthly futures over the next decade, suggests the
            Brent-WTI spread may remain closer to Goldman's estimate in the
            third quarter than to Bank of America's. Brent contracts
            averaged over the third quarter are trading at a premium of
            $7.88 a barrel to the equivalent three-month average for WTI. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's what makes a market,' Marshall Berol, co-portfolio
            manager of the Encompass Fund in San Francisco, which has about
            $250 million in assets, said in a telephone interview. 'You get
            some people on one side of a question and others on the other
            side. It's a huge market, and a lot of people are playing in it
            with big bucks.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Derby's Falling Sky Shows Goldman Sachs's Covello Spreading Risk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Inc. partner James Covello says that when it comes to race horses, his work on
            Wall Street has taught him it's all about spreading the risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was still a big leap in
            purchasing a 40 percent stake in Falling Sky, one of 20 horses scheduled to run in the 139th Kentucky Derby
            at Churchill Downs (CHDN) in Louisville, Kentucky, in two days, Covello said. The 3-year-old went for
            $425,000 at the Ocala Breeders Sales Co. winter sale in January, by far the highest price of the session
            three years after the colt was purchased for $16,000 at Keeneland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a calculated
            risk,' Covello, 40, said in a telephone interview. 'You have to be as analytical as possible in trying to
            marry the numbers.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Falling Sky will go off at 50-1 in the Derby, the first leg of
            thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown. Since Covello and his partners bought the colt, he has won the Sam F.
            Davis on Feb. 2, come in third at the Tampa Bay Derby on March 9 and fourth in the Arkansas Derby, the
            longest of his races at 1 1/8 miles, to earn $205,000 so far in 2013. The Kentucky Derby is 1 1/4 miles.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Covello, a semiconductor analyst at Goldman Sachs (GS), studies Thoro-Graph, a
            performance-rating number that is calculated on the basis of time of the race, beaten lengths, ground lost
            or saved, weight carried, the effect of wind, and a track variant. Falling Sky's number is 5, the same as
            Giacomo, a 50-1 longshot that captured the Derby in 2005 to return $102.60 on a $2 win bet. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Deal Averted Osborne Embarrassment, Group Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was able to
            avoid paying as much as 20 million pounds ($31 million) in U.K.
            taxes as the government fought to shield Chancellor of the
            Exchequer George Osborne from political embarrassment, an
            advocacy group said at a London trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group, UK Uncut, said Her Majesty's Revenue Customs
            reached the agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne
            announced a bankers' code to counter tax avoidance. The HMRC
            executive said in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was
            concerned the bank might drop out of the code if the deal was
            scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The reputation and standing of officials or of HMRC, and
            potential embarrassment to a minister, is not a relevant matter
            to take into account when deciding to waive collection of
            several million pounds of interest,' Ingrid Simler, a lawyer
            for UK Uncut, said in filings prepared for a judicial review
            that started in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-
            avoidance schemes following widespread media and public anger
            caused by the amount of corporation tax the likes of Google
            Inc. (GOOG), Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) pay in the country.
            Lawmakers said in a report last week that increased transparency
            about companies' tax affairs would build pressure on
            multinational businesses to 'pay a fair share.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Takes Ebix Private as Probes Said to Intensify</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made its
            $820 million offer to take Ebix (EBIX) Inc. private as U.S. regulators
            intensify their probes of the insurance software maker,
            according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The all-cash deal amounts to about $20 a share, Atlanta-
            based Ebix said yesterday. Its shares jumped 11 percent on the
            news to $20.60 in Nasdaq trading, the biggest one-day gain since
            October 2011. The shares dropped 5.1 percent to $19.55 at
            12:26 p.m. today in New York. A 'go-shop' provision allows
            Ebix to solicit competing bids in the next 45 days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Should no better offer emerge, New York-based Goldman Sachs
            will become the owner of a company whose accounting practices
            were already under scrutiny by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission in November, according to four people with direct
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That probe, consisting of interviews with former employees,
            has since been upgraded to a formal investigation, according to
            a person who was briefed on the matter after the Goldman Sachs
            deal was announced and who asked not to be named because the
            matter was confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebix is also the subject of an Internal Revenue Service
            investigation, according to this person, along with a second
            individual with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ted Wang, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
            co-head of equities trading for the Americas, is retiring after
            18 years at the company and will become an advisory director. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wang also was global co-head of the One Delta trading unit,
            according to an internal memo from trading co-heads Isabelle Ealet, Pablo Salame and Ashok Varadhan. Michael
            DuVally, a
            Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the top equity-trading bank last year,
            posted a 6 percent decline in first-quarter revenue for that
            business from a year earlier, the biggest drop among its U.S.
            peers. The firm said it had challenges in market-making in Japan
            and certain emerging-markets amid falling prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ted has played an integral role in the growth of our
            market-leading equities franchise and has been at the center of
            many of our most significant transactions,' Ealet, Salame and
            Varadhan wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So-called delta-one desks provide clients with strategies
            to hedge holdings or bet on directional moves in markets using
            derivatives or baskets of securities, which can be cheaper to
            trade than obtaining all of the stocks involved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wang joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and became a partner in
            2006, according to the memo. He took on his most recent role in
            2012, after leading convertibles trading and the Americas One
            Delta business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter D. Selman is the other co-head for the Americas
            equities business, while Brian T. Levine serves as co-head of
            One Delta. DuVally declined to comment on whether new co-heads
            would be named. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to joining Goldman Sachs, Wang co-founded Xeotron
            Corp., a company that specialized in DNA biochips, according to
            a biography on the website of the Committee of 100, a
            nonpartisan group of Chinese Americans seeking to encourage
            positive relations between the two nations. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Malaysian Bond Fees Would Face Scrutiny in Poll Upset</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Malaysia's opposition coalition led by
            Anwar Ibrahim may ask Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to renegotiate
            terms on a $3 billion bond placement should it win the election
            this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank arranged the March 19 debt sale by 1Malaysia
            Development Bhd., a sovereign-wealth fund known as 1MDB headed
            by Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose political opponents have
            questioned the timing, cost and pricing of the issue. New York-
            based Goldman's fees exceeded $200 million for arranging the
            placement and three other dollar bond sales totaling $6.35
            billion by Malaysian issuers in the past two years, according to
            a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are really focused on corporate governance and should
            we win, we will review all public deals,' Rafizi Ramli,
            strategic director at Anwar's People's Justice Party, said in an
            interview in Kuala Lumpur today. 'The 1MDB transaction has been
            shrouded in secrecy. We would go back to the renegotiation table
            and see what would have been a fairer deal should there be any
            questionable part of the deal mix.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling National Front coalition is facing its fiercest
            challenge to date, after retaining power five years ago by the
            narrowest margin since Malaysia won independence from the U.K.
            in 1957. This is going to be the closest election Malaysia has

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners Alison Mass and David Dase weren't buying. The bankers
            stared skeptically at a glass of brownish liquid as a young man described a new technology for purifying
            even the filthiest water. The sample was safe to drink, he said, taking a sip. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than
            1,000 investment-banking colleagues, watching a video of the encounter at a daylong strategy session at the
            New York Hilton Midtown in March, erupted in laughter. The man with the purification pitch was an actor.
            Mass and Dase, who weren't in on the joke, were doing their best to salvage a meeting that Goldman Sachs
            President Gary Cohn had asked each of them to take, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its June 2014
            issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the video was the latest episode in a series of hidden-camera pranks
            targeting partners, a broader message wasn't hard to fathom: Goldman Sachs bankers have taken enough crap.
            Just a few years after the firm's reputation was sullied by sales of shoddy, crisis-era mortgage bonds,
            including one that an executive at the company described in an e-mail as a 'shitty deal,' the
            investment-banking unit is coming off one of its best years ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Mahoney for Asia Financial Institutions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;John Mahoney, a Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc. investment banker who leads the firm's efforts to advise
            U.S. lenders, is moving to Asia to head the financial-institutions group in that region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mahoney, 56, will replace Peter Enns, who's becoming chief
            executive officer of Goldman Sachs's business in Canada,
            according to an April memo to employees obtained yesterday by
            Bloomberg News. Kenneth Coquillette and Scott Romanoff will
            replace Mahoney as co-heads of the banking industry for FIG in
            the Americas, according to a separate memo last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global mergers and acquisitions involving financial
            companies totaled less than $1.2 trillion each of the past five
            years, after surpassing $2 trillion in 2007, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser
            on financial company deals so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mahoney will be head of FIG for Asia ex-Japan, based in
            Hong Kong, according to the April 11 memo from executives
            including FIG global co-heads Mike Esposito and Todd Leland.
            Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
            confirmed the contents of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mahoney joined Goldman Sachs in 1987 and became a partner
            in 2000. He advised Toronto-Dominion Bank on its 2006 sale of TD
            Waterhouse USA to Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Countrywide
            Financial Corp. on its 2008 sale to Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Craig Murray and Bernard Teo were named co-chief operating
            officers of FIG for Asia ex-Japan under Mahoney. Goldman Sachs
            said last month that Enns, a Canadian, would move from Hong Kong
            to Toronto to replace Jack Curtin, 63, who's retiring at year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coquillette, co-head of investment banking for the Midwest
            region, joined Goldman Sachs in 1988 and became a partner in
            2010. He'll move from Chicago to New York in his new role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Romanoff, who joined in 1992 and was named a partner in
            2008, will continue to serve as co-head of the FIG financing
            group for the Americas, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which stood
            by Steven A. Cohen last year as his SAC Capital Advisors LP bore
            the brunt of a massive insider trading probe, has come to the
            billionaire's aid again. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The top prime broker to the former hedge-fund firm, Goldman
            Sachs is making a personal loan to Cohen for the first time,
            according to a regulatory filing, joining the list of banks that
            have provided SAC's founder with credit lines backed by his $1
            billion art collection. Like Citigroup Inc. (C), JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Bank of America Corp., New York-based Goldman Sachs is
            making the loan through its private bank as part of an effort to
            expand its business catering to ultra-wealthy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
            President Gary Cohn expressed support for Cohen, 57, after SAC
            was indicted in July by federal regulators for insider trading,
            and continued to do business with the firm after it agreed to
            pay $1.8 billion in November to settle the charges. Goldman
            Sachs stepped in after Cohen had been seeking an art loan for
            months, having paid off and terminated his personal credit line
            from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), said two people familiar with the matter,
            who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Closes Real Estate Credit Fund at $4.2 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            shifted its real estate focus to lending from buying properties
            after the financial crisis, completed fundraising for its second
            real estate credit pool at $4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm raised $1.8 billion in equity
            pledges from institutions and wealthy individuals, supplemented
            by the same amount in borrowings and $600 million of the firm's
            own money, said Alan Kava, co-head of the real estate investing
            group in Goldman's merchant banking division. About 60 percent
            of the capital pledged came from U.S. investors and most of the
            rest was from Europe, with a small amount from Asian investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman is competing with other private debt funds,
            mortgage-oriented real estate investment trusts and banks in
            offering ways to earn higher yields at a time of low interest
            rates. The new vehicle will invest in Europe and the U.S.,
            expanding on Goldman's first real estate credit fund, which made
            about $3.5 billion of loans, according to a marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will be opportunistic in terms of where we see
            value,' Kava said in a telephone interview. 'The first fund
            was U.S. only. We're hopeful we will end up with about 50-50'
            between the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new Broad Street Real Estate Credit Partners II plans
            to make senior loans and mezzanine loans backed by high-quality
            commercial real estate, to fund acquisitions, refinancings and
            recapitalizations, according to the document. It intends to
            generate returns in the 'mid-teens' by charging interest rates
            of 7 percent to 10 percent and leveraging the equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Current Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund will make and hold the loans, distributing the
            interest income it receives to investors quarterly, said Peter
            Weidman, the managing director who oversees the new fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What our investors like about this is it's a current
            yield so we're not just making one-time distributions by
            securitizing,' Weidman said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund has invested about $500 million already, in
            five deals, according to the marketing document. They include a
            mezzanine loan to help finance the purchase of a group of
            Southern California office buildings, and a senior loan, or
            first mortgage, on a New York City rental apartment building
            that's being converted to for-sale condominiums. Higher-yielding
            mezzanine loans are used to fill the gap between first mortgages
            and equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's first real estate credit fund, known as Real
            Estate Mezzanine Partners, made 28 investments, about two-thirds
            of which were senior mortgages and one-third mezzanine loans,
            according to the marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a competitive advantage by focusing on larger
            deals and being able to provide the entire loan to our
            borrowers,' Weidman said. 'We see less competition in the
            larger loan space.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund has an investment period of three years, with
            possible extensions, according to the marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Lost Money on Two Days in First Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
            posted losses from that business on two days in the first three
            months of 2013, compared with one day a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's traders made more than $100 million on 17 days
            in the quarter ended March 31, compared with 24 days in the
            year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
            regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank generated $5.22 billion from its trading division
            in the first quarter of 2013, excluding accounting charges, a 12
            percent declined from the year-earlier period. About $230
            million of that revenue came from a reinsurance business the
            firm sold a majority stake in this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clients were 'more active really in the first month of the
            quarter and then it slowed down a bit in March,' Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. 'As issues
            started to come back more on to front screens as it relates to
            issues in Europe, clients obviously pulled back toward the end
            of the quarter.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had perfect
            trading records in the first quarter, making money on every day
            of the period, while Morgan Stanley posted losses in eight
            sessions. Citigroup Inc. doesn't disclose money-losing days. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Stemcor Said to Hire Goldman Sachs as It Seeks Loan Standstill</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stemcor Holdings Ltd., a London-based
            steel trader, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise it on a
            debt refinancing and potential asset sales as the company seeks
            to repay a $850 million facility that matured this week,
            according to three people with knowledge of matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is advising Stemcor as it discusses with lenders a
            so-called standstill agreement, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the negotiations are private. The steel
            trader is seeking an agreement to extend and reduce the size of
            the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company reported a loss last year as turnover fell to
            about 5 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) from about 6 billion
            pounds a year earlier, according to a statement on its website.
            Reduced demand for steel in recession-hit Europe drove down the
            prices of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel product, 15 percent
            in the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Armitstead, a London-based Stemcor spokesman who
            works for Pendomer Communications LLP, and Goldman Sachs
            spokeswoman Joanna Carss declined to comment on the financing or
            the bank's advisory role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The standstill, under which banks agree not to demand
            repayment of the loan for a specified period of time, would also
            apply to a one-year $225 million loan raised by Stemcor's Asian
            unit Stemcor SEA Pte Ltd., one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stemcor was founded in 1951 and the majority of its shares
            are held by the Oppenheimer family, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rio Bond Risk Withstands Goldman Iron Ore Dusk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Debt investors are betting
            Australia's iron-ore producers will survive what Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. has described as the dusk of a bull market as they
            improve balance sheets and cut production costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bond risk for BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group fell
            this quarter even as prices of the steelmaking ingredient
            slumped 11 percent, according to CMA credit-default swap
            pricing. Contracts for Rio, which last year got 87 percent of
            its profit from iron ore, were at 93 basis points on May 8, 12
            below this year's high. Those for BHP dropped to 61 basis points
            from as high as 71. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BHP and Rio have been lifting production while also
            taking out costs,' Ben Byrne, a credit sector specialist at
            Citigroup Inc. in Sydney, said by phone May 9. 'These efforts
            have offset weaker commodity prices to some degree.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman wrote in a May 7 report that over-investment in new
            supply means dusk is settling on the iron-ore bull market from
            2004 to 2013, which will force mine closures among high-cost
            producers. BHP and Rio, the world's two biggest mining
            companies, are reining in investment and cutting debt after a
            decade-long boom in metal prices slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rio plans to reduce spending on new operations to about $8
            billion in 2015, less than half its outlay in 2012. BHP is
            focusing on the highest-returning projects and plans to spend
            $16 billion during fiscal 2014 on new projects and exploration,
            down from $22 billion the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bond Dearth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The austerity drive, which includes slashing operating
            costs, is set to reduce net debt for both companies. Rio's may
            fall 21 percent to $14.2 billion in 2015 compared with this
            year, RBC Capital Markets forecast this month. BHP's net debt
            may fall 45 percent to $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, RBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The savings drive by the miners means there's a smaller
            pool of debt for bond investors to choose from, said Chris Walter, a credit analyst in Sydney at Westpac
            Banking Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's little to no supply of cash bonds in the near
            term' from mining companies, Walter said. 'Credit investors
            still need to put their money to work in a low-yield
            environment, so it's not surprising we're seeing further spread
            tightening' in CDS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BHP and Rio have both predicted lower iron-ore prices this
            year after producers in Australia and Brazil spent billions of
            dollars to expand output. After a balanced export market in 2013
            totaling 1.2 billion metric tons, Goldman Sachs forecasts a
            surplus of about 77 million tons this year, rising to about 145
            million tons next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Metrics Strained &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. dollar debt issued by Rio returned 1.7 percent this
            quarter through May 8 while BHP's gained 1.6 percent, according
            to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Metals, Mining Steel
            Index. The gauge advanced 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's 10-year bond yield fell to an seven-month low
            of 3.80 percent last week, before closing at 3.82 percent. It
            offered a 1.21 percentage point pick-up over similar-maturity
            U.S. Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aussie dollar, the world's fifth most-traded currency,
            fetched 93.56 U.S. cents as of 5 p.m. in Sydney on May 9, having
            gained 4.9 percent since Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growth in China, the biggest buyer of iron ore, is slowing
            after the government reined in a credit boom and toughened
            regulation to combat pollution. The economy expanded 7.4 percent
            in the first quarter from a year earlier, matching the weakest
            pace since 2009. Premier Li Keqiang is targeting growth of 7.5
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore entered a bear market in March and fell to $103.70
            a ton on May 8, the lowest level since September 2012, taking
            this year's price drop to 23 percent. The average annual price
            is forecast to decline each year until at least 2017, according
            to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If iron ore fell to $80 or $90 a ton in the next couple
            of years, Rio's credit metrics could become strained for its
            current A- and A3 ratings,' said Byrne. 'However there is
            little risk of a credit event given the company's scale and
            strong liquidity.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Arcapita to Weigh Loan Offers From Fortress, Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita Bank BSC, an Islamic-compliant fund manager, will consider a revised offer for a
            bankruptcy-exit loan from Fortress Credit Corp. to compete with
            a proposal from Goldman Sachs International. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both loan offers of $350 million would fund Arcapita's exit
            from Chapter 11 protection, Fortress said in papers filed today
            in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Fortress said it had been
            in talks since last year to provide an exit loan to Arcapita and
            was disappointed that the company and its creditors' committee
            chose the Goldman Sachs offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is unclear to Fortress why both the debtors and the
            committee have lent their support to the GSI proposal,'
            Fortress said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress, which is also an agent to Arcapita's bankruptcy
            operating loan, said that the Goldman Sachs proposal may have
            been influenced by a conflict of interest and might allow some
            unsecured creditors, including members of the creditors'
            committee, to improve their positions in Arcapita's capital
            structure relative to other unsecured creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita and its creditors will 'seek approval of the best
            exit facility proposal, whether that proposal comes from
            Fortress or GSI,' Fortress said. A hearing is set for May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress said its revised offer would fund Arcapita's exit
            at a better price, doesn't include administrative fees, and
            won't make Arcapita pay if it enters into an alternative
            transaction. Fortress also would allow Arcapita keep as much as
            $30 million in sale proceeds, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita, based in Manama, Bahrain, filed for Chapter 11
            protection in March 2012 after being unable to complete an out-of-court restructuring of $1.1 billion in
            unsecured debt. It
            listed assets of $3.06 billion and debt of $2.55 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When its bankruptcy began, Arcapita had interests in 39
            companies, and $7 billion in assets under management. Arcapita
            has minority interests in 80 percent of its investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Arcapita Bank BSC, 12-bk-11076, U.S. Bankruptcy
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Investors Should Oppose Pay Plan, Glass Lewis Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS). shareholders should vote against the bank's executive-pay plan,
            proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis Co. said, while ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA supported the program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been 'deficient' in linking compensation to company performance, Glass Lewis said
            yesterday in a report, which also opposed the re-election of compensation committee Chairman James A.
            Johnson. ISS said in a May 8 report that shareholders should vote for Johnson at the New York-based bank's
            May 23 annual meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, received $21
            million for last year, his highest annual compensation package since 2007. Goldman Sachs shares climbed 41
            percent in 2012, leaving them 24 percent below the level at which they ended 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs doesn't have specific measures to help set annual pay for top executives, Glass Lewis said in the
            report, which gave the firm a 'D' grade in linking pay to performance. ISS said the increase in executive
            pay for 2012 reflected stronger company performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the bank has topped peers in
            earnings-per-share growth and return on equity, it has trailed in total shareholder return, according to
            Glass Lewis's analysis. Glass Lewis recommended last year that shareholders back the pay plan in an advisory
            vote, and the measure was approved with 94 percent support. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells Second-Largest Callable Step-Up Note of 2013</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $31
            million of 15-year callable step-up notes, the second-largest
            such offering in the U.S. this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued May 8, yield 3.25 percent for the
            first eight years, then increase five more times to 7.5 percent
            for the last year, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York bank and
            Incapital LLC distributed the notes for a 3.24 percent fee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has the option to call the notes quarterly
            starting Nov. 13, according to the prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold $42 million of 15-year callable step-up
            notes in two related offerings on Feb. 19 and 25, the biggest
            such deal this year. The securities yield 3.5 percent annually
            for the first eight years, then increase four times to 7.5
            percent during the last six months, according to a prospectus
            filed with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has issued the most rate-tied notes in the
            U.S. this year, $418.9 million, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The bank was also No. 1 for all of 2012, selling
            $1.14 billion of the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Dismissal of Abacus CDO Suit on Appeal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
            dismissal of bond insurer ACA Financial Guaranty Corp.'s fraud
            lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A New York state appeals court in Manhattan today ordered
            the complaint against Goldman Sachs dismissed, overturning a
            lower-court ruling that had allowed the case to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA claimed that New York-based Goldman Sachs and hedge-fund firm Paulson Co. conspired to induce
            ACA to provide
            financial guaranty insurance for the Abacus transaction and
            deceived the insurer into believing Paulson was a long investor
            when in fact it was taking a short position. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeals court said ACA could have uncovered Paulson's
            actual position, 'but apparently chose not to.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Plaintiff should have questioned defendant or the non-party hedge fund,' the court said. 'Such an
            inquiry would have
            likely informed plaintiff that the nonparty hedge fund was
            taking a short rather than a long equity position.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA added New York-based Paulson as a defendant in the
            lawsuit this year. A court has yet to rule on the hedge fund's
            motion to dismiss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for New York-based ACA, said his
            client may ask the divided appellate panel to reconsider the
            decision and would pursue an appeal to the state's highest court
            in Albany. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Two-Judge Dissent' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As the two-judge dissent makes clear, the three-judge
            majority's line of reasoning neither comports with the factual
            record nor the law on this issue,' Kasowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in July 2010 won court approval of a
            $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission over claims that it misled investors in the Abacus
            CDO. Goldman Sachs failed to disclose Paulson's role in
            selecting underlying securities or that Paulson had taken a
            short position against the CDO, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank didn't admit or deny wrongdoing in the SEC
            settlement. It acknowledged that it made a 'mistake' and that
            marketing materials for the instruments had 'incomplete
            information,' the agency said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. v. Goldman Sachs
            Co., 650027-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects age of Sago in second paragraph of story
            published May 14.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Katsunori Sago, deputy president of
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Japanese unit, will leave the firm
            where he began his career 22 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sago, 46, will resign from his post in June and serve as an
            advisory director and vice chairman until he departs by March
            31, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, said by phone
            today. The company has no plan to fill the deputy president
            position, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among his roles, Sago served as co-chairman of the bank's
            diversity committee in Asia. Goldman Sachs formed a daycare
            center in Tokyo in 2009 and has been running a campaign under
            the banner 'Womenomics' to urge Japan's government and
            companies to promote women in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two women were among nine Japan employees who were promoted
            to managing director in January, according to the Wall Street
            firm's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sago is also head of the company's securities division in
            Japan. That post will be filled by Mark Agne and Hidehiro Imatsu, according to an internal memo obtained by
            Bloomberg
            News. Matsumoto confirmed the contents of the document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sago joined Goldman Sachs in Tokyo in 1992 after graduating
            from the University of Tokyo's engineering school. He worked in
            fixed-income trading and became a managing director in 1999
            before joining the Japan unit's board in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Citi Hired to Manage Delek Group Spinoff of Energy Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG), the Israeli
            conglomerate with interests from energy to insurance, picked
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. to set up a company
            to hold its energy activities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will also manage the new unit's listing abroad,
            Itay Gore, a spokesman for the Netanya-based Delek, confirmed. A
            time frame hasn't been set for the spinoff or the share sale,
            which will probably be in London, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Delek's structural change, announced in December, will
            enable a larger and more varied group of investors to access the
            company's activities, Asaf Bartfeld, the group's chief executive
            officer, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Delek shares have advanced more than 50 percent in the past
            12 months, making them the best performers on the TA-25
            benchmark index. The company has been selling non-energy assets
            to focus on its oil and gas business, and the offshore Tamar
            natural gas field, in which it holds stakes via units, started
            production in March last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Kenneth Heebner, who once ranked as
            America's No. 1 stock picker, took new positions in Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ), while selling
            out of Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heebner's Capital Growth Management LP purchased 843,000
            shares of Goldman Sachs during the first quarter, based on a
            filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The money
            manager bought 4.9 million shares of auto-rental chain Hertz
            Global. Capital Growth sold $152.1 million of Bank of America
            shares and $110.2 million of Herbalife, a marketer of
            nutritional supplements, in the three months ended March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heebner's CGM Focus Fund (CGMFX) topped all diversified U.S. stock
            mutual funds in the decade through 2007 and has returned 22
            percent this year, beating 99 percent of its peers, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. The Boston-based fund's assets
            plunged to $1.5 billion at the end of October from the June 2008
            peak of $10.3 billion, as it lost an annual 8.9 percent in the
            past five years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has surged 22 percent this year compared with
            the 16 percent gain in the Standard Poor's 500 Index. The Wall
            Street bank, which generates the highest percentage of sales
            from trading, reported last month that revenue from that
            business fell more than its rivals during the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by revenue,
            has climbed 16 percent in 2013. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said in April mortgage banking
            and trading marred
            first-quarter results and slowed the company's turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hertz, the largest publicly traded U.S. rental-car
            operator, is awaiting U.S. antitrust approval for its
            acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group. Shares have
            surged 54 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heebner's firm added to its stake in Herbalife in the
            fourth quarter when shares plunged 31 percent after hedge-fund
            manager Bill Ackman accused the company of operating a pyramid
            scheme. Herbalife has surged 37 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capital Growth also exited positions in Ford Motor Co. and
            Foot Locker Inc. during the first quarter. The firm also bought
            homebuilder NVR Inc. and BlackRock Inc., the world's largest
            asset manager. While Heebner's firm remained bullish on housing
            stocks, with Lennar Corp. and DR Horton Inc. among the five
            biggest holdings, the biggest decreases in market value was to
            PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money manager's stake in financial companies remained
            the biggest allocation out of 10 industries. Citigroup Inc. and
            Morgan Stanley remained the firm's two largest holdings,
            accounting for 6 percent and 5.8 percent of its investments,
            respectively. The firm also boosted its ownership of industrial
            and energy shares, while trimming holdings of consumer
            discretionary and staples stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Finance $500 Million for SolarCity Roofs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; SolarCity Corp. (SCTY), a solar-energy
            developer chaired by billionaire Elon Musk, won financing from
            Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. for more than $500 million in rooftop
            solar systems that the company will complete this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lease-financing agreement will help SolarCity build
            about 110 megawatts of solar power systems with little or no up-front cost for homeowners and businesses,
            San Mateo, California-based SolarCity said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal is the largest single financing agreement for
            rooftop systems in the U.S. and will raise awareness of the
            quality of the solar-lease asset class, SolarCity Chief
            Executive Officer Lyndon Rive said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We hope it sends a signal that solar is a stable and
            reliable asset to invest in,' Rive said in an interview.
            'These aren't luxury yachts we're talking about, it's your
            energy, and the default rates are lower than mortgages.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the first quarter, SolarCity said it invested $138.2
            million in solar systems as demand for rooftop panels from
            homeowners and businesses surged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SolarCity agreement
            will help reach the Wall Street bank's goal of financing $40
            billion in renewable energy during the next decade, said Stuart Bernstein, global head of clean technology.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'SolarCity's range of distributed solar solutions
            targeting a wider customer base will help us move toward a low
            carbon energy future,' Bernstein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The financing agreement also allows SolarCity to extend
            credit to homeowners with lower credit scores, Rive said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When we started you needed a FICO score of 720 or
            higher,' Rive said. 'Now it's more like 680 and I suspect in
            the near term we'll be at 650.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SolarCity climbed 11 percent to $35.69 at the close in New
            York. The shares have quadrupled since the initial offering in
            December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Tax Deal Didn't Break U.K. Law, Judge Rules</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s deal with
            the U.K. government that may have saved the investment bank as
            much as 20 million pounds ($30.6 million) on its taxes didn't
            break any laws, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her Majesty's Revenue Customs's decision to reduce the
            New York-based bank's tax bill was properly conducted, a judge
            in London ruled today. Still, Judge Andrew Nicol criticized tax
            officials who considered the potential embarrassment to
            Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne if a deal with
            Goldman Sachs wasn't completed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The settlement with Goldman Sachs was not a glorious
            episode in the history of the Revenue,' Nicol said in his
            written ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-avoidance schemes following widespread media
            and public anger
            caused by the amount of corporation tax the likes of Google
            Inc., Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Amazon.com Inc. pay in the country.
            Lawmakers said in a report last month that increased
            transparency about companies' tax affairs would build pressure
            on multinational businesses to 'pay a fair share.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action, an advocacy group that lobbies for
            alternatives to government spending cuts, said HMRC reached the
            agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne announced a
            bankers' code to counter tax avoidance. An HMRC executive said
            in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was concerned the bank
            might drop out of the code if the deal was scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sees Large-Scale ECB Bond Buying of Limited Effect</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank is unlikely
            to begin large-scale asset purchases to stimulate inflation and
            such a plan would have limited effect as nations' borrowing
            costs are already low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We doubt that a large-scale asset-purchase program would
            have a meaningful impact on yields,' Goldman Sachs analysts,
            including London-based chief European economist Huw Pill, wrote
            in a client report. 'With rates at such low levels, it is
            unclear how attractive euro-area government yields will look for
            investors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ECB President Mario Draghi said on May 8 that the Governing
            Council was ready to act at its meeting next month to boost the
            currency bloc's economy. He had previously indicated stimulus
            measures being considered included quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With a rally in the region's sovereign bonds leaving
            borrowing costs in the most-indebted nations near record lows,
            'the likelihood of a large-scale asset-purchase program remains
            small,' the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report, dated
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 2.95 percent as
            of 2:52 p.m. London time after falling to 2.83 percent
            yesterday, the least since Bloomberg began collecting the data
            in 1993. The rates on similar maturity Italian debt were at 3.05
            percent, from a euro-era low of 2.89 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer prices in the euro area rose an annualized 0.7
            percent in April, below half the central bank's goal of just
            under 2 percent for a seventh month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Expansion Beyond N.Y. Leads Shareholders to Texas</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has expanded
            its workforce outside New York and San Francisco mainly to cut
            costs. Its office in Irving, Texas, also aims to boost revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The office, among the firm's largest in the nation with
            about 650 employees, hosted the investment bank's annual
            shareholders meeting today with Texas Governor Rick Perry giving
            a speech. In addition to typical back-office functions such as
            accounting and information security, the location houses a
            commercial real estate lending group and is the headquarters for
            the realty-management division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That group is the descendant of a joint venture named
            Archon that Goldman Sachs set up in 1991 with J.E. Robert Cos.
            to buy distressed assets from the Resolution Trust Corp. after
            the savings and loan crisis. The division, led by partner Tom Dowling, now sources deals and manages real
            estate investments
            for the bank's special-situations group and property funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the division doesn't have its own balance sheet, and
            instead aids deals by the firm's revenue-producing units, it
            deployed about $7 billion in loans and investments last year,
            according to a person with knowledge of its operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired all of Archon in 2000, and the
            business operated as an independent subsidiary for years. It
            purchased more than $1 billion of property in the U.S. in some
            years, mostly for the bank's Whitehall real estate funds,
            according to a former employee. That activity dropped as the
            U.S. property market plunged, and the last Whitehall fund was
            raised in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dallas, Bangalore &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Irving, in Dallas's shadow with a population of about
            225,500, is home to businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the
            world's second most valuable company, and CEC Entertainment
            Inc., owner of the Chuck E. Cheese pizza chain. Goldman Sachs
            also has an office in Dallas with several private wealth
            management advisers and one investment banker, managing director
            Peter Brundage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in
            November that a quarter of the firm's employees were located
            near Dallas, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Bangalore, India.
            That's increased from 10 percent in 2007 as the bank looks to
            cut expenses, he said. The firm hosted its annual meeting in
            Salt Lake City last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pay Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shareholders elected all of the firm's nominees for the
            board of directors, General Counsel Greg Palm said today,
            announcing a preliminary count of the votes. About 83 percent of
            votes approved the bank's executive pay plan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like Morgan Stanley's annual meeting earlier this week,
            today's gathering featured no questions from shareholders and
            lasted fewer than 40 minutes. About half the meeting was taken
            up by Perry's speech, which extolled the benefits of companies
            moving to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein thanked Perry for his support of Goldman Sachs's
            businesses in the state. The CEO didn't accept a shareholder's
            invitation to move the firm's headquarters to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think there's a lot of compelling reasons to move to
            Texas and a lot of compelling reasons to stay where we are,
            including Newton's first law of inertia,' Blankfein said in an
            interview after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beyond the meeting, Goldman Sachs is trying to cement ties
            to the area. Dina H. Powell, a partner who leads the firm's
            charitable efforts, announced this week the start of the bank's
            10,000 Small Businesses education and funding program in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Eyes Japan Renewable Energy Investments</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
            invest as much as 50 billion yen ($487 million) in renewable
            energy projects in Japan in the next five years, tapping demand
            for electricity produced from solar and wind-power generators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm also plans to take as much as 250
            billion yen of bank loans and project-financing over the same
            period to move ahead with projects that would cost a total of
            300 billion yen, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for
            Goldman, said by telephone. The Nikkei newspaper reported the
            plan earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan began offering incentives in July through feed-in
            tariffs to encourage renewables after the Fukushima nuclear-plant crisis stemming from the March 11, 2011
            earthquake and
            tsunami. Japan has been forced to slash its reliance on atomic
            power generation since Fukushima. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe that we can leverage our global expertise in
            investing in renewable energy in places such as the U.S. and
            India, to help expand Japan's renewable power capabilities,'
            Ankur Sahu, co-head of the merchant banking division in the
            Asia-Pacific, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs formed the Japan Renewable Energy Co. unit in
            August to plan, design and operate power plants run on sun,
            wind, fuel cells and biomass fuels, it said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investor Attraction &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy has attracted interest from investors
            ranging from billionaire Masayoshi Son's Softbank Corp. (9984) and
            financial-services company Orix Corp. (8591) to the country's biggest
            banks led by Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan will probably become the largest solar market in the
            world after China this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commercial and utility-scale projects will boost solar
            installations to a range of 6.1 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts in
            2013, exceeding an earlier forecast of 3.2 gigawatts to 4
            gigawatts, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies that stand to benefit include Kyocera Corp. (6971),
            Sharp Corp. and Suntech Power Japan Corp., all of which make and
            sell solar panels for residential and industrial use. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says 'Formal Sales Process' Started for Metro</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it has
            begun the process to sell Metro International Trade Services
            LLC, the metals warehouse business purchased by the bank in
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Metro is not strategic to our client activities, and the
            firm has concluded that this is the right time to explore a
            sale, given recent interest by potential buyers,' Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an
            e-mailed
            statement today. 'A formal sales process has begun.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley are
            scaling back their raw-material businesses. Commodity revenue at
            the 10 largest banks fell 18 percent last year amid reduced
            volatility, Coalition, a London-based analytics company, said in
            February. Regulators are concerned that lenders might be able to
            wield control over prices, or suffer losses that would endanger
            the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
            posted its worst year in five in 2013 as gold fell the most
            since 1981 and corn, arabica coffee and wheat slid at least 20
            percent. Commodity-related assets under management shrank by
            about $100 billion, or about 25 percent of the total held at the
            year's start, Barclays estimated in February. The GSCI index
            rose 3.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman received inquiries from potential buyers in
            November after the London Metal Exchange proposed new rules on
            how storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter
            said at the time. The LME postponed implementation after the
            plan, intended to ease aluminum bottlenecks at warehouses, was
            tossed out by a judge. This month, the LME was granted
            permission to appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumers of metals including brewer MillerCoors LLC
            complained that lengthy waits for stockpiled supplies inflated
            costs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. LNG Export Potential Gaining Momentum, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Liquefied natural gas exports from
            the U.S. are looking more likely after the Freeport LNG terminal
            got conditional approval from the Department of Energy, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Freeport LNG Development LP's project in Texas was the
            second facility to receive approval from the Energy Department
            to send gas to countries that don't have free-trade agreements
            with the U.S. The terminal would be able to export 1.4 billion
            cubic feet a day. The development, partly owned by
            ConocoPhillips (COP), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Osaka Gas Co. (9532), still needs
            approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These recent developments support our view that at least
            6.8 billion cubic feet a day of liquefaction of capacity will be
            built in the U.S.,' Goldman Sachs analysts led by London-based
            Samantha Dart said in a report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market doesn't need more than 7.7 billion cubic feet a
            day of U.S. LNG for the next decade based on the bank's demand
            forecasts, according to the note. Gas prices at the Henry Hub in
            Erath, Louisiana, need to stay at or below $5.10 per million
            British thermal units to keep U.S. LNG competitive in Europe,
            Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contract for June delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent
            to $4.108 per million Btu in electronic trading today on the New
            York Mercantile Exchange. Futures rose 0.9 percent to close at
            $4.09 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Assuming a normalized oil price of $100 a barrel, U.S.
            gas would likely be cheaper than oil-indexed contracted
            deliveries in Asia for Henry Hub prices at $6.60 per million
            Btu,' Dart said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cheniere Energy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. conditionally approved Cheniere Energy Inc.'s (LNG)
            Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana in May 2011 for exports of
            as much as 2.2 billion cubic feet a day. The government has
            weighed 20 applications for export terminals in recent months,
            which could ship the equivalent of 41 percent of U.S. total
            production this year, Energy Department data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. may export 6.5 billion to 8.5 billion cubic feet a
            day of gas by 2020, Adam Longson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS)
            in New York, said in an e-mailed report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Energy Department 'will only need to approve two more
            projects by early- to mid-2016 in order for U.S. LNG exports to
            reach the low end of our estimates,' Longson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Henry Hub gas prices will average $3.80 per million Btu
            this year, higher than the previous estimate of $3.52, the
            Energy Information Administration said May 7 in its monthly
            Short-Term Energy Outlook. The average may slump to $3.77 in the
            third quarter before climbing to $3.92 during the final three
            months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>S&amp;amp;P 500 May Reach 2,100, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
            U.S. stock-market rally may last at least another 2 1/2 years,
            sending the Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) up 26 percent to 2,100. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Kostin, the bank's New York-based chief U.S. equity
            strategist, raised forecasts for the U.S. equity benchmark,
            predicting it will finish 2013 at 1,750 and 2014 at 1,900 as
            stock valuations increase, according to a research report dated
            yesterday. The SP 500 trades at 16.3 times reported operating
            profit, 16 percent below the average since 1998, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our positive 2013 outlook for SP 500 has played out much
            faster than we expected,' Kostin wrote. 'Reasons for a higher
            multiple include increased confidence in the medium-term outlook
            for U.S. economic growth, improving investor risk appetite and
            the wide gap between equity and bond yields that we now assume
            will be closed more by stocks than bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's increase comes after Thomas Lee, JPMorgan
            Chase Co.'s chief U.S. equity strategist, lifted his estimate
            to 1,715 from 1,580 last week. The SP 500 has surged 17 percent
            in 2013 as companies beat earnings estimates and the Federal
            Reserve continued its unprecedented bond-buying program known as
            quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The equity benchmark gained 0.2 percent to 1,669.16 at 4
            p.m. New York time today. The index has rallied 128 days without
            a retreat exceeding 5 percent or more, the longest stretch since
            the 173 days ending Feb. 20, 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dividend Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP 500 companies from Apple Inc. to Clorox Co. raised
            dividends this year, giving the index a higher dividend increase
            than earnings expansion for the first quarter, according to
            Kostin. Dividends will rise 30 percent by 2015, with an 11
            percent increase this year, adding about 150 points to the SP
            500, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dividend growth has been pretty robust,' Kostin said in
            a phone interview today. 'A lot of companies with these super
            high margins are distributing more cash to shareholders with
            high dividends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Excess Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks are poised to gain during the next five years
            thanks to record-low interest rates on government bonds,
            according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
            York. A survey of 29 models for the equity risk premium -- the
            expected future return of stocks over the risk-free rate offered
            by Treasuries -- shows 'we will enjoy historically high excess
            returns for the SP 500,' Fed economists Fernando Duarte and
            Carlo Rosa said in a paper released on May 8. The premium rose
            to a record 5.4 percent in December, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 added 2.1 percent last week, its fourth
            straight weekly gain, as gauges of leading economic indicators
            and consumer sentiment beat estimates. The U.S. bull market has
            entered its fifth year, adding about $11.5 trillion in market
            value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's certainly been a substantial and powerful move in
            equity prices in a short period of time, there's no question,'
            Kostin said today. 'This year, basically all that market move
            has been valuation-driven,' he said. 'The economy's re-accelerating from a multi-year period of stagnation
            to an above-trend growth rate, and that would be consistent with P/E
            expansion.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Merck to Buy Back $5 Billion of Its Shares From Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Merck Co. (MRK), the second-biggest U.S.
            drugmaker, reached a deal to repurchase $5 billion of its shares
            from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as part of a buyback program
            announced earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck will make an initial purchase of 99.5 million shares
            based on current market prices, according to a statement today
            from the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based company. The
            transaction is expected to be completed by Nov. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck, facing generic competition to what was once its
            best-selling drug, earlier this month cut its full-year guidance
            in anticipation of lower sales and said it would buy back as
            much as $15 billion in shares. The move is a good use of cash
            and may help appease investors who have lost 22 percent of their
            value in the stock over the past six years, said Bill Smead,
            chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The stock has been down so long,' Smead, whose firm owns
            shares, said in a telephone interview. 'There is nothing else
            to do with the cash if you are already expensing your RD and
            already paying a good dividend. If you have extra cash there is
            really nothing to do with that than a share buyback unless you
            are going to make an acquisition.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck sold bonds last week to fund some of the share
            repurchases, which the company had said were to reach about $7.5
            billion over 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This accelerated share repurchase demonstrates our
            commitment to delivering increased value to shareholders in the
            short term, while continuing to invest in the important
            opportunities that will drive our long-term growth,' Merck
            Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck rose 4.7 percent to $47.33 at the close in New York
            time prior to the announcement. The drugmaker has gained 26
            percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck has been struggling to boost profit since its once
            top-selling asthma medicine Singulair began facing generic
            competition in August and research setbacks have delayed new
            products. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Seek ICBC Exit With $1.1 Billion Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ended a
            seven-year investment in Industrial Commercial Bank of China
            Ltd. by selling a $1.1 billion stake in the world's largest
            lender by market value, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank sold 1.58 billion shares in ICBC at HK$5.50
            each, the person said, asking not to be identified as the
            information is private. That's a 2.5 percent discount to ICBC's
            closing price yesterday in Hong Kong trading. The Beijing-based
            bank closed 2.1 percent lower at HK$5.52 today, paring its gain
            for the past year to 19 percent. Singapore's state-owned Temasek
            Holdings Private Ltd. bought 280 million ICBC shares, increasing
            its stake to 7.04 percent, according to disclosures posted the
            Hong Kong stock exchange website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm joins Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of
            America Corp. in cutting holdings in China as new capital rules
            known as Basel III make it more expensive to hold minority
            stakes in banks. Goldman Sachs has reaped about $12 billion in
            sales proceeds and dividends from its $2.58 billion investment
            in ICBC, calculations by Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Many foreign banks are facing capital shortages with the
            new Basel requirement, so I'm not surprised that they dumped
            holdings in Chinese banks on which they've already made massive
            returns,' said Chen Xingyu, a Shanghai-based analyst at Phillip
            Securities Group. 'The exit strategy has been on the table for
            these foreign investors since the very beginning because they
            know these aren't real strategic investments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and client funds offloaded ICBC shares at
            least five times before the latest transaction after first
            investing in ICBC in 2006. Connie Ling, a spokeswoman for New
            York-based Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment today
            on the latest sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Capital Deductions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New rules set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
            require punitive capital deductions for holding minority
            investments in other financial institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' Tier 1 common ratio was about 12.7 percent
            under Basel I and an estimated 9 percent under Basel III, Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup sold its entire stake in Shanghai Pudong
            Development Bank in March 2012, nine years after buying it, for
            an after-tax gain of $349 million. Bank of America sold 10.4
            billion shares of China Construction Bank Corp. in November 2011
            for a profit of about $1.8 billion, its fourth sale, leaving it
            with a 1 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICBC last month reported a 12 percent increase in first-quarter profit, defying a sluggish domestic
            economy to boost
            lending. The world's most profitable lender extended 461 billion
            yuan ($75 billion) of new loans in the first quarter, 25 percent
            more than in the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Low Valuations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank and its closest local rivals are trading near
            record-low valuations on concern that profit growth may slow as
            loans sour and the government deregulates interest rates. ICBC
            trades at about six times estimated 2013 earnings, down from a
            high of 21 times in early 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's good timing for Goldman to sell its stake in ICBC,'
            said Rainy Yuan, an analyst in Shanghai at Masterlink Securities
            Corp. 'Valuations of Chinese banks will remain low as China's
            interest-rate liberalization is a long-term trend which will
            hurt lenders' profits.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-rating companies have also warned that China isn't
            reducing risks from local-government debt and credit expansion
            fast enough. China's shadow banking system -- which includes
            private lending, trust loans, and credit from non-bank
            institutions -- poses systemic risks to the nation's financial
            industry after expanding by more than 67 percent over the past
            two years, Moody's Investors Service said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Soured Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese banks' nonperforming loans increased for a sixth
            straight quarter, the longest streak in at least nine years, to
            526.5 billion yuan as of March 31, regulatory data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe NPL figures greatly understate the potential
            scope of the problem of poor quality loans,' Carson Block, the
            short seller who runs Muddy Waters LLC, said in an e-mailed
            reply to queries. 'Our concerns implicate loans throughout the
            economy -- both public and private sector.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Block said this month that he's betting against the debt of
            Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), in part because an economic slowdown in
            China will lead to 'considerable stress' at the U.K. lender,
            which gets two-thirds of profit from Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global financial firms including Temasek Holdings Pte
            invested $33 billion in Chinese lenders from 2001 to 2009,
            according to the regulator. They still own at least $45 billion
            of stakes in local banks, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since acquiring the stake in ICBC in 2006, Goldman Sachs
            has recorded $3.47 billion in net gains on the position,
            according to company filings through the first quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As of March, Goldman Sachs had a $1.11 billion position in
            ICBC on its own balance sheet, down from $2.08 billion at the
            end of December because of a sale in January, according to the
            firm's 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells NYSE Market-Making Business to IMC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
            sell its New York Stock Exchange market-making unit to IMC
            Financial Markets, a high-frequency trading firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IMC Chicago LLC, a unit of Amsterdam-based IMC, will become
            a designated market maker at the NYSE by acquiring Goldman
            Sachs's rights, the companies said in a statement today. The
            transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter,
            makes IMC a designated market maker for more than 630 securities
            and about 400 companies, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. (ICE)'s NYSE relies on
            traders known as designated market makers, or DMMs, to
            facilitate the buying and selling of shares. Barclays Plc (BARC) and
            KCG Holdings Inc. (KCG) are the biggest DMMs, followed by Goldman
            Sachs and Virtu Financial Inc., a person with knowledge of the
            matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's DMM employees are to join IMC as part of
            the transaction, including floor traders and corporate-relations
            staff, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. New York-based
            Goldman Sachs was seeking as much as $30 million for the
            business, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Closely held IMC stands for International Marketmakers
            Combination and was founded in Amsterdam in 1989 by two traders
            who worked on the open outcry floor of Europe's first options
            exchange, according to the company website. IMC is a market
            maker in equities, bonds, commodities and currencies on 90
            exchanges globally. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Shareholders Approve Executive-Pay Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investors voted to approve pay packages of top managers after Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein's total awards climbed 73 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compensation
            plan was approved with 87 percent support in the non-binding vote, according to a tally disclosed in a
            regulatory filing today after the firm's annual meeting in Salt Lake City. All of the bank's directors were
            elected, including former Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, who joined the board in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, was awarded $21 million for his performance in 2012, and received a $5 million
            long-term incentive. That was up from $12 million and a $3 million long-term award a year earlier. Shares of
            the New York-based bank climbed 41 percent in 2012, the most in three years, still leaving them 24 percent
            below their price at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis Co. said earlier
            this month that shareholders should oppose the bank's executive-pay plan. Goldman Sachs has been 'deficient'
            in linking compensation to company performance, Glass Lewis said. ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA supported
            the compensation program and said the increase in executive pay for 2012 reflected stronger company results.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shareholders rejected four measures proposed by investors and opposed by the board,
            according to the tallies, which include abstentions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maximize Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One
            requested that the board hire an investment bank to explore options for maximizing shareholder value,
            including a merger or sale of the company. It received 1.3 percent of the vote, according to data in the
            filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two others would have required the bank to disclose the amount it spends on
            lobbying and to set up a committee to assess its policies on human rights. Those measures received 5.6
            percent and 3.5 percent support, respectively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another would give shareholders the
            ability to nominate their own selections for the board. It got support from 5.2 percent of the votes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held the meeting for the first time at its offices in Salt Lake City, the bank's
            second-largest U.S. location. The bank has shifted more of its staff to what it calls high-value locations
            in an effort to cut costs. About 22 percent of Goldman Sachs employees work in such places, which also
            include Dallas and Singapore, up from 10 percent in 2007, Blankfein said in November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Committed to China After ICBC Sale, CEO Blankfein Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said his company is
            committed to growing in China even after it ended a seven-year
            investment in Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs this week sold a $1.1 billion stake in ICBC,
            the world's largest lender by market value, a person familiar
            with the matter said. The firm reaped about $12 billion in sales
            proceeds and dividends from its $2.58 billion investment in
            ICBC, calculations by Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'ICBC is not the key to our interest in China, or the big
            reflection of it,' Blankfein, 58, said in a Bloomberg
            Television interview with Erik Schatzker. 'We're investing in
            China because China -- I was going to say it's the future, but
            it's a big part of the present as well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein said earlier this month that this will probably
            be China's century, even if it struggles in certain years.
            China's economic growth slowed to 7.7 percent in the first
            quarter, and a report yesterday showed manufacturing is
            contracting in May for the first time in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs served as a 'quasi-strategic' partner for
            ICBC as the Chinese government took its banking industry public,
            Blankfein said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Links Bonuses to Protecting Firm Reputation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) linked
            bonuses and promotions to employees' success in protecting the
            firm's reputation and put new restrictions on some client
            transactions to avoid a repeat of the damage to its standing in
            the wake of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 'new-activity committee' will evaluate and approve
            suitability when clients undertake transactions that carry new
            risks, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a report. When
            setting year-end pay, the firm is reviewing employees' efforts
            to protect its reputation and win clients' trust, according to
            the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is holding its annual shareholders'
            meeting today in Salt Lake City, created a business-standards
            committee in May 2010 as it faced a lawsuit from the Securities
            and Exchange Commission over a mortgage-related security called
            Abacus 2007-AC1. The firm settled that suit by agreeing to pay
            $550 million, and said it made a mistake in omitting disclosures
            to investors in the product. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If an Abacus transaction came today, it would encounter a
            completely different framework of processes, practices,
            procedures, transaction approval and review than what we had
            before,' said J. Michael Evans, a Goldman Sachs partner who led
            the business-standards committee with E. Gerald Corrigan. 'It
            might have the same name, but it would look a lot different.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Buyback Orders Reach Highest Level of Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors trying to explain the
            resilience of American equities during a global selloff may want
            to consider the pace that companies are repurchasing shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 79 percent of buyback orders at Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc.'s corporate trading desk were active yesterday, the most
            this year, according to a note to clients obtained by Bloomberg
            News. Companies stepped up purchases as the Standard Poor's
            500 Index fell as much as 3 percent from an intraday record
            reached May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The buybacks may have limited losses in American equities
            after shares in Japan fell the most in two years and stock
            markets from London to Paris and Frankfurt saw declines of more
            than 2 percent. The SP 500 closed yesterday down 0.3 percent,
            trimming gains to 16 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The overall buy-the-dip mentality is very, very
            prevalent,' Jim Welsh, who helps oversee $6 billion at Forward
            Management LLC in San Francisco, said in a phone interview.
            'When you have corporate buybacks, it's kind of like a support
            underneath the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 1,649.60 at 4 p.m. in
            New York, paring losses after falling as much as 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;$275 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies authorize buybacks and carry them out from time
            to time through brokerages as a way to reduce outstanding stock
            and increase per-share earnings. U.S. firms have announced about
            $275 billion of repurchases this quarter, the highest total in
            more than five years, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist
            at LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA), wrote in a report this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aflac Inc. (AFL), the largest provider of supplemental health
            insurance, plans to buy back $600 million in stock this year,
            Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos said at a presentation to
            investors this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck Co., the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker, reached a
            deal to repurchase $5 billion of its shares from Goldman Sachs
            as part of a buyback program announced earlier this month,
            according to a statement on May 21. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot of these corporate buybacks are on autopilots, in
            other words, the board authorized X amount of purchases and
            these will be done over many months,' Forward's Welsh said.
            'Whether or not it's to the discretion of Goldman or the
            investment bank, I don't know. I do believe the amount of stock
            buybacks have definitely been helpful to the overall market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Buyback Achievers Index, which consists of
            companies that repurchased at least 5 percent of their shares in
            the previous 12 months, has tripled since March 2009. That
            compares with the 144 percent gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares in the SP 500 are trading at about 15 times
            estimates for 2013 earnings, above the five-year average of
            about 13 times, according to a May 20 note from David Kostin,
            the chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Advises Selling WTI Oil, Buying Brent for December 2014</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) recommended
            selling West Texas Intermediate crude and buying North Sea Brent
            contracts for December 2014 as supplies accumulate on the U.S.
            Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The discount on WTI for delivery in December 2014 against
            the equivalent Brent contract has narrowed to $8.38 a barrel
            from $10.11 a month ago. The spread should widen as pipelines
            carrying crude out of the U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma,
            cause a build-up on the Gulf Coast that would lower the price of
            WTI versus the European benchmark, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If an oversupply of light, sweet crude in the U.S. Gulf
            coast becomes a problem as soon as third quarter 2013, it should
            be an even bigger problem in 2014,' analysts Jeffrey Currie and
            Stefan Wieler in New York said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The discount on front-month WTI against Brent, at $8.44 a
            barrel today, is still set to narrow toward $5 in the third
            quarter as new pipeline capacity to move oil out of Cushing
            causes stockpiles there to decline 'substantially,' Goldman
            said. Booming U.S. production expanded the discount on WTI to
            more than $28 a barrel in October, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Refinery maintenance and reduced pipeline flows are
            'putting a drag on a more meaningful decline of Cushing
            inventories,' according to the report. Supplies at Cushing
            increased by 0.9 percent to 50.2 million barrels in the week to
            May 17, according to the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Co-Founder of Goldman's Metro Unit Gets LME Warehouse</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Whelan Metals LLC, founded by a
            former co-owner of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s warehouse company,
            obtained approval from the London Metal Exchange to store
            industrial metals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whelan's first LME warehouse is in Detroit and will hold
            aluminum, North American aluminum alloy, nickel, lead and zinc,
            the LME said in a notice to members today. The Canton, Michigan-based company is part of W.F. Whelan Co., an
            automotive parts
            warehousing and brokerage company in Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman said last week it was exploring the sale of Metro,
            joining JPMorgan Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley in cutting back
            in commodities as Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Gunvor Group
            Ltd. expand. The Federal Reserve has said it's considering new
            limits on trading and warehousing of physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The uncertainty of the regulatory landscape, particularly
            in the U.S., means you're going to see more non-financial, more
            lightly or not regulated companies perhaps like Whelan moving
            into the warehousing space,' said Robin Bhar, an analyst at
            Societe Generale SA in London. 'There will always be companies
            looking at warehousing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Whelan, the president of the company, founded Metro
            International Trade Services LLC with Ed Schulak in 1991. Metro
            stores most of the aluminum in Detroit LME-licensed warehouses,
            according to exchange data. The wait time to withdraw aluminum
            from Metro's warehouses in the city was 683 days, or 98 weeks,
            at the end of April, according to an LME report this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whelan Metals may expand beyond Detroit, Whelan said last
            year. He wasn't available for comment today and didn't return an
            e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BTG Pactual Commodities Warehousing LLC was approved by the
            LME to store metals in Detroit in April. Scale Distribution Ltd.
            in Liverpool, England, added depots in Detroit in January. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Names UBS and Goldman Sachs to Lead Royal Mail Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government appointed UBS AG (UBSN)
            and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as joint global coordinators and
            joint bookrunners for the sale of Royal Mail Group Ltd, the
            state-owned postal service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) will be joint bookrunner and sponsor, and Bank
            of America (BAC) Merrill Lynch will be joint bookrunner for the deal,
            the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in London
            said in an e-mailed statement today. No final decision has been
            taken about how or when to sell Royal Mail, according to the
            statement. The government has said its preferred option is an
            initial public offering by the end of the current financial year
            next March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While all options for the form of sale remain open, it is
            important that we are in a position to move ahead swiftly with
            our chosen route once we take the final decision,' Business
            Minister Michael Fallon said in the statement. 'The appointed
            banking syndicate will work to make sure we are ready to proceed
            when the time comes and will be able to deliver strong, high-quality investor demand to ensure a successful
            IPO for the
            taxpayer and for Royal Mail.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The planned sale of Royal Mail will be the largest
            privatization in Britain since former Prime Minister John Major
            broke up the country's railway more than a decade ago. The 360-year-old company, one of the nation's biggest
            employers with
            about 159,000 staff, has sought to adapt its letter-focused
            network to more lucrative package delivery in the face of
            competition from TNT NV of the Netherlands and Deutsche Post
            AG (DPW)'s DHL Express unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Mail's operating profit more than doubled in the year
            to March 31 to 403 million pounds ($609 million) as growth in
            web-based shopping spurred parcel deliveries, the company said
            in a statement last week. While sales gained 5 percent to 9.28
            billion pounds, parcel revenue rose 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Mail appointed Equiniti Group this month to manage
            the distribution of 10 percent of its shares to employees
            following any sale. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Shuns Bonds Pimco's Gross Favors in 'New Neutral'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;As Bill Gross vows to restore top
            performance at the world's biggest bond fund, he's taking a path
            many of his rivals shun. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross, who manages the $230 billion Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX)
            at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach,
            California, is betting five-year Treasuries, which are more
            sensitive to changes in the central bank rate than longer-dated
            bonds, will do well because markets overestimate how much the
            Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Bond managers at
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) say he's wrong and the intermediate bonds he holds will
            suffer when the Fed lifts borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once they see the whites of the eyes of full employment,
            they will want to normalize rates at a faster clip,' Jonathan Beinner, co-head of global fixed income at
            Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross, 70, is betting on an economic view he calls the
            'new neutral,' which argues that the top speeds of the biggest
            economies and their equilibrium interest rates have declined and
            won't return to levels seen before the financial crisis. While
            most bond managers agree rates will be lower, with the federal
            funds target ranging somewhere between 3 percent and 4 percent
            by 2018, Gross sees it at just 2 percent, making bonds
            attractive to Pimco that BlackRock and Goldman Sachs won't
            touch. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;LSIS will provide panels and other equipment for the plant
            through Kajima Corp. (1812) and the order is worth about 40 billion won
            ($35 million), the South Korean news agency reported on its
            Japanese website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman set up Japan Renewable Energy Co. in August to
            plan, design and operate power plants that run on sunlight,
            wind, fuel cells and biomass. The 40 megawatt generator is
            expected to start operating in January 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Biden Will Speak at Goldman Sachs's Energy Summit Next Month</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will
            deliver the keynote address at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s North
            American Energy Summit next month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Biden will speak at the June 11 summit for leaders from
            government and companies, according to a statement today from
            New York-based Goldman Sachs. Petroleos Mexicanos Chief
            Executive Officer Emilio Lozoya, Duke Energy Corp. CEO Lynn Good, and U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz are
            all scheduled
            to attend, Goldman Sachs said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shale oil and gas development in North America was listed
            as one of 25 key global trends in Goldman Sachs's 2013 annual
            report last month. The production may lead to a more stable oil
            market and strengthen the U.S. dollar, the bank's research
            analysts said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary Cohn, who will attend the summit, started
            in the commodities
            trading division. The pair has said the firm will remain
            committed to that unit, even as other large banks such as
            JPMorgan Chase Co. and Barclays Plc have scaled back. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MasterCard to Stop Using Goldman's Asset-Management Services</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest
            U.S. payments network, will stop using Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            for asset-management services after discussing the matter with a
            firm that advises shareholders on proxy votes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had received a total of $230,000 in 2011 and
            2012 for providing the services, Purchase, New York-based
            MasterCard said today in a regulatory filing. Directors had
            analyzed the payments when considering the independence of board
            member Mark Schwartz, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman, according
            to an annual filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 58, who joined the MasterCard board in 2006, is
            chairman of the audit committee and on the corporate governance
            committee, according to the April filing. Directors concluded
            that the payments to New York-based Goldman Sachs didn't
            compromise his independence, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard, led by Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga, 53,
            didn't elaborate on the reasoning behind the decision in today's
            filing, which didn't name the proxy firm. Chris Monteiro, a
            spokesman for the company, declined to comment, while Goldman
            Sachs's David Wells didn't have an immediate response. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Among 22 Candidates on Russia Eurobond List</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia selected 22 banks as possible
            organizers of its first Eurobond sale in more than a year, the
            government said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The list to manage a planned $7 billion offering has four
            domestic lenders and 18 foreign banks including Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), according
            to a government decree published today and dated May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The release indicates the government overcame a dispute
            between the economy and finance ministries over how to pick
            banks to organize the sale, which left Russia unable to tap the
            market when yields fell to record lows earlier this year. The
            world's largest energy exporter sold $7 billion of bonds in
            March 2012, including 30-year debt, in what was the largest
            emerging-market sovereign issue since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decree gives the Finance Ministry the right to select
            from among the approved organizers for bond issues this year on
            international capital markets. Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said May 16 the government was
            considering Deutsche
            Bank and Citigroup Inc. (C), while Sberbank CIB, VTB Capital and OAO
            Gazprombank were also candidates. There will be 'rotation'
            from the managers picked last year, according to Storchak. &lt;/p&gt;

            204,500 tons, out of a total of 608,450 tons. The company, owned
            by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., delisted two other warehouses at
            Johor, according to an LME notice on May 16. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to BofA Are Said to Trade With SAC After Plea Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) are among Wall Street
            firms still catering to SAC Capital Advisors LP after the hedge
            fund agreed to plead guilty to insider trading charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks, which also include Morgan Stanley, continue to
            provide trading and prime-brokerage services to SAC, said people
            briefed on the matter, who requested anonymity when discussing
            specific clients. The hedge-fund firm, run by billionaire Steven A. Cohen, agreed yesterday to pay $1.8
            billion -- a record
            penalty for insider trading -- to settle allegations it
            illicitly reaped hundreds of millions of dollars since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The presumption is that if JPMorgan should resign the
            business, then someone else would do it,' said Roy Smith, a
            finance professor at New York University's Stern School of
            Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. 'These people all
            say we serve our clients, so if our clients get into trouble, we
            serve them as long as we can.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are weighing the potential damage to their
            reputations and finances if they continue dealing with Stamford,
            Connecticut-based SAC, one of Wall Street's largest trading
            clients. While SAC agreed to stop managing money for outsiders,
            it may continue investing Cohen's personal fortune of about $9
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Steel Corp. (X) and AK Steel Holding
            Corp. (AKS) gained after after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
            rating on the unprofitable companies to buy from sell and said
            the outlook for the domestic steel industry is improving because
            of higher demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AK rose 11 percent to $5.11 at 10:31 a.m. in New York after
            climbing as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday increase
            since June 27. U.S. Steel Corp., the country's largest producer
            of the metal by volume, rose as much as 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see the sector heading to a sustainable recovery over
            the coming years,' Sal Tharani, a New York-based analyst at
            Goldman, said in a note today. He revised his view of the U.S.
            steel industry to 'neutral' from 'cautious.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The supply-demand fundamentals for steel are starting to
            look more appealing, particularly for flat steel, as some supply
            has been taken out and demand drivers are firmly in place,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. steel industry has suffered from global
            overcapacity since the financial crisis. Pittsburgh-based U.S.
            Steel, the country's largest producer of the metal by volume,
            said Oct. 30 it will permanently close parts of plants in the
            U.S. and Canada as it tries to reduce costs after four
            unprofitable quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Domestic steel prices are recovering. Hot-rolled steel
            coil, a benchmark product used in manufacturing, are at $660 a
            short ton, the highest since September last year, according to
            data from The Steel Index, a trade publication. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Steel and West Chester, Ohio-based AK use blast
            furnaces to process iron ore and then combine the iron with
            other raw materials in basic-oxygen furnaces to make steel. U.S.
            competitors Nucor Corp. (NUE) and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD), which remelt
            scrap, have cheaper operating costs. Tharani today raised Fort
            Wayne, Indiana-based Steel Dynamics to buy from hold. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Asia Fund Chairman Bolitho to Leave Company</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Oliver Bolitho, chairman of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s fund management division in Asia, is leaving
            after 15 years at the company, according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bolitho will become an advisory director after his
            retirement at the end of the year, according to the Nov. 4 memo
            obtained by Bloomberg. Christopher Jun, a spokesman for Goldman
            Sachs in Seoul, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bolitho, a U.K. citizen, served as head of Goldman Sachs's
            U.K. and Irish institutional business from 2001 until moving to
            Hong Kong in 2007 to run the fund business in Asia outside of
            Japan. A partner since 2008, Bolitho became chairman of Goldman
            Sachs Asset Management last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His departure comes almost a year after Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management moved Sheila Patel to Singapore from London to lead
            the fund business in Asia outside of Japan and said that Bolitho
            would report to Patel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $878 billion of assets under management
            as of Sept. 30, according to the New York-based company's third-quarter earnings report. The company doesn't
            report how much of
            that is in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AsianInvestor, a Hong Kong-based trade journal, reported
            Bolitho's pending departure on its website earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management runs hedge funds, private
            equity and real estate investments alongside those in fixed
            income, stocks, money markets and commodities, according to its
            website. The unit employs more than 700 investment specialists
            in 32 offices worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Benchmark Asset Management Co.,
            India's largest provider of index-tracking funds, in March 2011,
            after setting up its own mutual-fund unit in the country in
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It also teamed up with RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC), Malaysia's fifth-largest banking group, in 2010 to
            jointly develop fund
            management products. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Surpasses Liquidity Minimum Under Fed Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s liquidity
            coverage ratio, a measure of its ability to survive a credit-market freeze, surpasses the minimum proposed
            by the Federal
            Reserve last month, said Treasurer Liz Beshel Robinson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would top the minimum even under the Fed's
            proposed stricter guidelines and therefore wouldn't be affected
            by a shorter timeline than international banks may face,
            Robinson said today on a conference-call with fixed-income
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed last month proposed rules to require the biggest
            banks to hold 30 days of easy-to-sell assets to make the
            companies safer in the event of a credit crisis like the one in
            2008. The plan had a shorter timeline than non-U.S. banks will
            face and was more restrictive in what U.S. banks can include
            among their assets. &lt;/p&gt;

            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn said today
            in a memo to employees. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New
            York-based bank, confirmed the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sherwood, 48, 'will help drive our strategy, identify new
            commercial opportunities and allocate resources in countries
            experiencing stronger economic growth and rapid business and
            capital markets development,' Blankfein and Cohn wrote in the
            memo. 'Michael will also oversee the performance of our
            businesses, including their footprint and pace of growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sherwood, a Briton, joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and became
            a partner in 1994, according to the memo. He was promoted to
            vice chairman in February 2008, at the same time as Evans, and
            kept his role as co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sherwood rose through the ranks of the fixed-income
            department like Blankfein, 59, and Cohn, 53. He was co-head of
            the trading business from 2003 to 2008. He's currently chairman
            of the partnership committee. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman-Led Twitter Underwriters Share $59.2 Million in IPO Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other underwriters on Twitter Inc. (TWTR)'s initial public offering
            will share about $59.2 million for managing the sale after accepting one of the smallest fee rates for a
            U.S. IPO this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banks are receiving 3.25 percent of the $1.82 billion that
            Twitter raised in its IPO, according to a regulatory filing today. Goldman Sachs led the sale, with help
            from firms including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase Co. The fee pool is typically split unevenly among
            underwriters, with larger shares going to banks more actively involved in the process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter's
            banker fees reflect a smaller proportion than underwriters have received in nearly every U.S. initial
            offering this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While investment banks use fee income as a major
            measure of success in deal underwriting, firms are sometimes willing to take a smaller share of proceeds for
            high-profile sales that may generate future business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman being the first name on
            the S-1 has little to do with fees,' Max Wolff, chief economist and strategist at ZT Wealth, said by phone
            from New York. 'This is about Goldman rebalancing itself as a serious leader and competing with Morgan
            Stanley's dominant position in technology.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the world's
            most profitable securities firm before the financial crisis,
            said it's under investigation by regulators probing the
            potential manipulation of foreign-exchange rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currencies and commodities were added to a list of
            financial products and related activities that are subject to
            investigation, according to a regulatory filing published by the
            New York-based company today. The filing also added options
            trading and technology systems and controls to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigators are looking at the firm's 'trading
            activities and communications in connection with the
            establishment of benchmark rates,' Goldman Sachs said in the
            filing. The company 'is cooperating with all such regulatory
            investigations and reviews.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least eight banks including Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) have said they're being investigated by authorities
            examining the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market and
            are cooperating. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays Plc (BARC) have
            suspended or put on leave some of their most senior currency
            traders amid the inquiry. No one has been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is examining legal and regulatory
            exemptions that have allowed banks including Goldman Sachs to
            trade and own raw materials such as oil, coal and metals, a
            person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Had 15 Losing Days in 3rd Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
            the steepest drop in trading revenue among Wall Street's largest
            banks, posted losses from that business on 15 days during the
            third quarter, the most since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders made more than $100 million on four days in the
            three months ended Sept. 30, down from seven days in the year-earlier period, the New York-based company
            said in a regulatory
            filing today. None of the losses were more than $50 million and
            none topped the bank's so-called value-at-risk, an estimate of
            potential trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $2.86 billion from its trading
            division in the third quarter, a 32 percent decrease from the
            year-earlier period. Client activity fell and the firm struggled
            to manage inventory amid speculation about whether the Federal
            Reserve would ease its economic stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Concerns about the global economic outlook created a more
            difficult operating environment for our clients in the third
            quarter,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a
            conference call last month. 'These challenges were amplified by
            the seasonal slowdown traditionally impacting client activity in
            July and August.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's inventory fell to $244.3 billion, a 25 percent
            drop from a year earlier and a 12 percent decline from the end
            of the second quarter. The was the biggest decline and the
            lowest absolute amount since the bank started disclosing the
            figure at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of days with losses was the highest since the
            firm had 17 such days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The four
            days of gains of more than $100 million were the fewest since
            the second quarter of 2012. Goldman Sachs hasn't had fewer than
            four such days in a quarter since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. posted daily losses twice during the
            quarter, including a $21 million misstep. Morgan Stanley posted
            losses on seven days, including two that topped $25 million. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Credit Swaps in U.S. Rise; Goldman Sachs Sells Five-Year Notes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. company credit risk
            rose as signs of an improving economy fueled speculation that
            the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus sooner than estimated.
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $1 billion of floating-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
            against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
            1.5 basis points from Nov. 8 to 73.3 basis points as of 4:24
            p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
            Bond markets were closed yesterday in the U.S. for the Veterans
            Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasury yields have climbed to an eight-week high since
            the Labor Department's better-than-forecast jobs report last
            week stoked speculation that the central bank would accelerate
            its timetable for slowing the pace of its $85 billion in monthly
            purchases of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The central bank's
            program is becoming riskier by the day, Dallas Fed President
            Richard Fisher said in a speech in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the sell-off in Treasuries that started on Friday
            and has continued to some extent today, the markets are a little
            on edge on when tapering will take place,' Marc Pinto, the head
            of corporate bond strategy at Susquehanna International Group
            LLP, said in a telephone interview from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swaps index typically rises as investor confidence
            deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
            buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
            less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
            $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Tipping Point' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American employers added 204,000 workers in October,
            topping the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg poll of
            economists, Labor Department figures showed on Nov. 8. The
            median forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
            for a gain of 120,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from
            increases of 50,000 to 175,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. 10-year yield climbed 2 basis points, or 0.02
            percentage point, to 2.77 percent as of 4:24 p.m. in New York
            from the close on Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed will start cutting its bond buying in March,
            according to the median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg
            News survey conducted Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a tipping point where monetary accommodation
            comes to be viewed not as the pleasant stimulus that levitates
            bond and stock and housing markets all over the world,' Fisher
            said today at an event in Melbourne. 'None of us really know
            where that tipping point is.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, sold
            the five-year, senior unsecured notes to yield 110 basis points
            more than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt is expected to
            be rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
            Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade
            bonds, rose 6.1 basis points from Nov. 8 to 356.7 basis points,
            Bloomberg prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate
            bonds rather than
            similar-maturity Treasuries increased 1.4 basis points to 129.2
            basis points, Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt rose 5.5 basis
            points to 540.6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk, or junk debt is rated below Baa3 by
            Moody's and lower than BBB- at Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blankfein Sees Goldman ROE Boost Without Wholesale Change</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, won't make any 'wholesale
            strategic change' to help improve returns, Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we have generated good relative returns in the last
            five years, they are hardly aspirational,' Blankfein, 59, said
            today at an investor conference in New York. 'We are committed
            to improving them regardless of the challenges presented in the
            current environment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has earned a return on equity of 10 percent
            so far this year, compared with 11 percent in 2012 and more than
            30 percent before the financial crisis. The shares trade at 1.06
            times book value, indicating that investors estimate the firm's
            cost of equity at around 10 percent, a figure that Blankfein
            said the company is focused on. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People throw out that number, 10 percent, I happen to
            think that's a pretty high number given that the risk-free rate
            of return is zero,' Blankfein said at a separate conference in
            New York today. 'But the market seems to have focused on that,
            so we've kind of focused on that number. Not for the long-term,
            but for this part of the cycle, I think that looks OK.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which before the financial crisis targeted a
            long-term ROE of 20 percent, has declined to set a goal since
            then, saying it wanted to see the effects of new rules. Recent
            international regulations have required banks to hold more
            equity capital, pushing down ROE. &lt;/p&gt;

            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said the firm would increase return on

        <headline>Goldman Names Managing Directors in Biennial Promotions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, promoted 280 employees to
            managing
            director, up from 266 last year, as it begins making the
            selections every two years instead of annually. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The promotions disclosed today on the company's website
            take effect Jan. 1 and won't happen again until 2015, after the
            bank decided earlier this year to change to a biennial process.
            New York-based Goldman Sachs last year named 70 people to its
            partnership, the fewest since the firm became a public company
            in 1999, and won't promote new partners until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said yesterday
            that the firm is always focused on recruiting and retaining top
            talent, even as it sets aside a lower portion of revenue for
            compensation. Blankfein, 59, said the average tenure for
            employees with a title of vice president or higher is 9.1 years,
            up from 7.6 years in 2001. Managing director is the second-highest title among non-executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The insight and perspective that is gained by living
            through several cycles is impossible to quantify, and having a
            group of professionals who have experienced those cycles
            together also carries an immeasurable benefit,' Blankfein said
            yesterday at an investor conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'The Federation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities division has the most new managing directors
            with 94, while 51 are in investment banking, 39 in investment
            management, 14 in research and eight in merchant banking, said
            David Wells, a bank spokesman. The other 74 work for the firm's
            administrative arm, known as 'The Federation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 56 percent of those just promoted are based in the
            Americas, 27 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 15
            percent in Asia-Pacific and 2 percent in India, Wells said. Last
            year, about 58 percent were in the Americas, 26 percent in EMEA
            and 17 percent in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Women comprise 20 percent of the incoming class of managing
            directors, compared with 23 percent in 2012 and 19 percent in
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average compensation cost per employee at Goldman Sachs
            fell 5 percent to $319,755 in the first nine months of 2013,
            even as revenue climbed 2 percent. The company employed 32,600
            people at the end of September, 3,100 fewer than at the end of
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Rigorous Exercise' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Managing directors typically receive a base salary of
            $500,000, lower than the $900,000 granted to partners. Both also
            get bonuses that can boost total compensation into the millions
            of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 7 percent of Goldman Sachs's employees hold the
            managing director title. The firm created a non-partner managing
            director title in 1996 to recognize top workers who weren't yet
            partners, and decided in March to switch from the annual
            tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A biennial process will allow us to invest more in the
            managing-director selection process so that it will continue to
            be a disciplined and rigorous exercise,' the bank said in a
            March memo to employees. 'This will help to ensure that the
            managing director title remains as aspirational as it should be
            for our top performers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's first class of 87 managing directors included
            William C. Dudley, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
            New York; Clifford S. Asness, who left in 1998 to start hedge
            fund AQR Capital Management LLC; and Richard J. Gnodde, who was
            named co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs in
            May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blankfein Says Goldman Sachs Can Boost ROE Without Major Changes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, won't make any 'wholesale
            strategic change' to help improve returns, Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we have generated good relative returns in the last
            five years, they are hardly aspirational,' Blankfein, 59, said
            yesterday at an investor conference in New York. 'We are
            committed to improving them regardless of the challenges
            presented in the current environment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has earned a return on equity of 10 percent
            so far this year, compared with 11 percent in 2012 and more than
            30 percent before the financial crisis. The shares trade at 1.06
            times book value, indicating that investors estimate the firm's
            cost of equity at around 10 percent, a figure that Blankfein
            said the company is focused on. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People throw out that number, 10 percent, I happen to
            think that's a pretty high number given that the risk-free rate
            of return is zero,' Blankfein said at a separate conference in
            New York yesterday. 'But the market seems to have focused on
            that, so we've kind of focused on that number. Not for the long-term, but for this part of the cycle, I
            think that looks OK.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which before the financial crisis targeted a
            long-term ROE of 20 percent, has declined to set a goal since
            then, saying it wanted to see the effects of new rules. Recent
            international regulations have required banks to hold more
            equity capital, pushing down ROE. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Pulls Loan From Commercial Mortgage Bond Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pulled a
            loan from a commercial-mortgage bond deal sold last week after
            investors balked at the debt amid concern that underwriting
            standards are slipping in the $550 billion market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $47.5 million loan, linked to 10 shopping malls in
            Nebraska and South Dakota, was removed because of a 'potential
            dispute' between the borrower and a lender, according to a
            filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The debt, called the Perkins Retail Portfolio, was
            originated by Jefferies Group Inc., according to deal documents
            obtained by Bloomberg News. C-III Capital Partners, the servicer
            overseeing the mortgage, was seeking additional information from
            the borrower about the properties while the $1.1 billion
            commercial-mortgage backed securities offering was being
            marketed, according to a Nov. 5 statement on C-III's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is one of the first instances that we are aware of
            that a loan was pulled out of CMBS deal after pricing,' said
            Richard Hill, a debt analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
            'That deal priced at a significant concession to another deal
            priced that same day, so investors were already concerned about
            the credit quality.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A top-ranked portion of the transaction maturing in 10
            years was sold to yield 108 basis points more than the benchmark
            swap rate, compared with 96 basis points on similar debt sold by
            JPMorgan Chase Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
            basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Incorrect Statements' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Richard
            Khaleel of Jefferies declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Perkins loan wasn't the only mortgage that raised red
            flags. In a supplement distributed to bond buyers prior to the
            pricing, the underwriters disclosed additional information about
            a $3.8 million loan linked to manufactured housing in Virginia,
            noting that the loan documents were being modified because the
            borrower failed to disclose a guilty plea in 1989 arising from
            'incorrect statements' submitted to lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of bonds linked to everything from strip malls to
            skyscrapers are poised to double to $70 billion this year as
            investors chase riskier assets with the Federal Reserve
            suppressing interest rates for almost five years, according to
            Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moody's Investors Service is increasing the amount of
            credit protection required to obtain investment-grade rankings
            on the debt as loans get risker, the New York-based rating
            company said in an Oct. 28 report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>N.Y. Fed Seeks Dismissal of Examiner Suit Over Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
            asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a former bank
            examiner who alleged she was fired for refusing to change
            findings about Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s conflict of interest
            policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York Fed said in a filing yesterday in Manhattan
            federal court that Carmen Segarra 'flagrantly violated' the
            bank's policies, federal regulations and federal criminal law by
            making confidential supervisory information public in her
            lawsuit and circulating it to the news media without permission
            from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed also said Segarra can't sue under the federal
            whistle-blower statute because her concerns about Goldman
            Sachs's policy didn't involve a violation of law or regulations.
            While she claimed Goldman lacked a firm-wide conflict-of-interest policy, Goldman's policies were actually
            available and
            posted on its public website, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The gravamen of the complaint is not a whistle-blower's
            provision of information, but a non-actionable disagreement
            between a supervised employee and more senior colleagues over
            how to interpret a Federal Reserve policy,' lawyers for the Fed
            wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said it fired Segarra for cause and not because
            she identified a possible violation of law or regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Segarra said in a lawsuit filed in October that she
            examined the legal and compliance divisions of Goldman Sachs in
            late 2011 and early 2012 and found that they lacked a policy
            that conformed with federal banking regulations. She alleges she
            was fired because she refused to withdraw her findings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said then that it has a comprehensive
            approach to addressing conflicts through firmwide and divisional
            policies and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Segarra v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York,13-cv-07173, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Draw Interest in Metro Warehousing Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            bought aluminum warehouse firm Metro International Trade
            Services LLC in 2010, has received inquiries from potential
            buyers after the London Metal Exchange imposed new rules on how
            storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn't engaged in a formal sale process, said
            the person, who requested anonymity because the talks are
            private and didn't identify the prospective purchasers. Gary Cohn, president of the New York-based company,
            told CNBC in July
            that it was allowed to own Metro for 10 years and that it would
            sell the business at 'an appropriate time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The LME, the world's biggest industrial-metals marketplace,
            changed its rules earlier this month to speed up withdrawals
            from warehoused stockpiles amid consumer complaints that
            prompted scrutiny from U.S. regulators. The changes will affect
            depots where waiting times exceed 50 calendar days, a broader
            group than the original proposal that pertained to sites where
            waits were longer than 100 days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs received interest from private-equity firms

        <headline>Goldman Seeks to Halt Singapore Tycoon Yen-Real Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit asked a court to halt Singapore tycoon Oei Hong Leong's lawsuit
            over losses after he was allegedly misled into making leveraged trades that the yen would fall against the
            Brazilian real. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International said in a Nov. 6 filing with the Singapore
            High Court that proceedings should be suspended in favor of private and confidential arbitration. Court
            papers detailing reasons aren't publicly accessible. A closed hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei, who in 2009 settled a claim against Citigroup Inc. over S$1 billion ($804 million) in trading
            losses, accused Goldman Sachs in his Sept. 20 lawsuit of making fraudulent representations that the real was
            a stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar. He's seeking $31.7 million in trading losses, plus
            interest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will defend Oei's lawsuit, which is without merit, Hong
            Kong-based spokesman Edward Naylor said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei will challenge Goldman Sachs's
            arbitration bid, his lawyer, Siraj Omar, said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Oei's position is that the Singapore
            court is the proper place to decide the claim, especially since the misrepresentation that he is complaining
            about occurred in Singapore,' Omar said. 'He sees no basis for moving this to confidential arbitration in
            London.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Alstom Said to Mandate Goldman for Preheaters Unit Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Alstom SA, the French builder of trains and power plants, has mandated Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
            explore a sale of its air preheaters and gas-gas heaters unit, according to people familiar with the matter.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The business may draw interest from private-equity companies, said two of the people,
            who declined to be identified as the plan is not public. The unit has annual sales of between 400 million
            euros and 500 million euros ($671 million), said two of the people. More information will be sent to
            potential bidders in coming weeks, they said. Representatives for Alstom and Goldman Sachs declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The products, made in the German cities of Mannheim and Dusseldorf, are used by
            power plants and boiler companies, according to Alstom's website. While air preheaters are directly involved
            in the power-generation process, gas-gas heaters are used in the flue gas cleaning process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alstom,
            based in Levallois-Perret near Paris, said this month it will deepen a cost-cutting drive and sell as much
            as 2 billion euros in assets by the end of 2014 as it seeks to sustain profit. Possible disposals include a
            minority stake in train and railway-equipment unit Alstom Transport that may attract industry and
            private-equity buyers, it said Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Venture Plans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alstom shares
            reversed losses and gained as much as 1 percent in Paris intraday trading after Bloomberg News reported the
            potential sale of the preheaters and gas-gas heaters unit. The stock was up 0.5 percent as of 11:22 a.m.,
            valuing the company at 8.3 billion euros. Before today, the stock had dropped 11 percent this year, while
            the French benchmark CAC 40 index gained 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Alstom and China's
            Shanghai Electric Group Co. announced a plan to create a joint venture to sell boilers for coal-fired power
            plants and spare parts for services. The talks about that venture are 'in a coma,' Alstom Chief Executive
            Officer Patrick Kron said this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company also plans to reduce costs by as much
            as 1.5 billion euros by April 2016 as demand for gas turbines weakens and pricing pressure hurts profit from
            onshore wind turbines and power-transmission gear. The manufacturer plans to cut 1,300 jobs, mainly in
            Europe. The reductions will affect the information-technology department and the boiler unit, and may be
            extended to other operations if needed, Kron has said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moody's Investors Service in June
            cut Alstom's long-term credit rating by one level to Baa3, the lowest investment grade. Standard Poor's,
            which gives Alstom debt its second-lowest investment rating of BBB, has said it may make a similar move.

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Seek Buyer for Uranium Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) put its
            uranium trading unit up for sale as prices for the radioactive
            metal fall and regulatory scrutiny of banks' commodity
            activities increases, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The person asked not to be identified because the decision
            hasn't been made public. SparkSpread, an online energy
            publication, reported the move earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices for uranium have declined since Japan's Fukushima
            nuclear disaster, which eroded demand for the metal as nations
            shuttered reactors. Banks from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to UBS AG
            have cut their price outlooks for next year as the radiation
            leaks fan speculation that the restart of Japan's idled plants
            will take longer than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is reviewing companies including
            Goldman Sachs as U.S. lawmakers and regulators raise concerns
            that banks might abuse their various roles in physical
            commodities markets for their own benefit, or that the
            businesses pose risks to the firms' financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank received inquiries from potential buyers for its
            aluminum warehousing company, Metro International Trade Services
            LLC, a person briefed on the matter said this week. New York-based Goldman Sachs bought Metro as a merchant
            banking
            investment in 2010 and must sell it by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Blackstone Said to Abandon Madrid Home Auction</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bidders including Blackstone Group
            LP (BX) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) dropped out of an auction of
            1,458 rental homes in Spain, leaving the properties unsold, two
            people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madrid's regional government received no binding offers for
            the portfolio comprising 22 developments in and around the
            Spanish capital by the Nov. 22 deadline, according to the
            people, who asked not to be named because the information is
            private. At least seven companies expressed an interest in
            buying the properties, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three years of government austerity, unemployment at 26
            percent and subdued mortgage lending are forcing more Spaniards
            to consider renting rather than buying homes. It's also
            prompting foreign funds to invest in the country's unsold
            residential properties, which may total 1.3 million units,
            according to Idealista.com, Spain's largest real estate website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the regional government of Madrid wasn't
            immediately available for comment. Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman
            for Goldman Sachs in London, and Andrew Dowler, a spokesman for
            Blackstone, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asking Price &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The minimum asking price for the homes, which are 94
            percent occupied with a delinquency rate of 21 percent, was 67.2
            million euros ($91 million), the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Home prices have fallen by an average of 40 percent since
            the market's peak in 2007, according to Fotocasa.es and the IESE
            business school. Rents in Madrid have fallen 19 percent since
            June 2008. In Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city, they've
            dropped 24 percent, according to data compiled by Idealista.com. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world's largest private-equity firm, which
            has spent $7.5 billion buying 40,000 homes in the U.S., agreed
            in July to purchase 18 apartment blocks from the city of Madrid
            for 125.5 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Azora Capital SL, a Madrid-based private-equity firm with 2.3 billion euros of
            assets under management,
            agreed in August to pay almost 20 percent more than the minimum
            asking price for 32 social-housing developments sold by the
            capital's regional government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spain's bad bank, known as Sareb, failed to attract high
            enough bids in its first sale of commercial real estate and will
            cut the size of the portfolio offered to make it easier to sell,
            three people familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Currency-Trading Definition Shows Disclosure Gap</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;What's the difference between
            trading currency products and currency trading? More than $1
            billion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank said last week that it didn't have a
            third-quarter loss in currency trading. That followed a report
            by Reuters on Goldman Sachs's Nov. 7 Securities and Exchange
            Commission filing, which shows a $1.32 billion loss from market-making in currency products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The disconnect stems from the fact that the biggest U.S.
            banks don't provide a revenue breakdown for units that make up
            their equity- and fixed-income trading divisions, which reap
            more than $70 billion a year. An SEC requirement that banks give
            some specifics on those businesses resulted in disclosures that
            firms such as Goldman Sachs, which gets more than half its
            revenue from trading, said lack meaningful context. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you're trying to figure out the profitability of
            different lines of business, I don't know how you effectively do
            that,' said Edward Siedle, a former SEC attorney and president
            of Ocean Ridge, Florida-based Benchmark Financial Services Inc.
            'The commission needs to be careful not to require a disclosure
            scheme that is just as likely to be misleading as it is to be
            revealing,' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to BofA Pitch Venezuela Deals to Drum Up Dollars</headline>

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of
            America Corp. (BAC) are among Wall Street firms that offered deals to
            help Venezuela obtain U.S. dollars amid a plunge in the nation's
            foreign reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A swap proposed by Goldman Sachs would provide $1.68
            billion in cash and be backed by $1.85 billion of the central
            bank's gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News show. Bank of
            America said it could be an intermediary for $3 billion in
            payments to firms seeking U.S. dollars, documents show. Neither
            deal has been completed, a government official with direct
            knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity because the
            talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollars are becoming scarce in Venezuela, limiting the
            supply of products from medicine to toilet paper in a nation
            that imports about three-quarters of goods it consumes. Foreign
            reserves dropped 28 percent this year, touching a nine-year low
            of $20.7 billion this month, largely because 70 percent of the
            assets are in gold. The metal plunged 26 percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fact you have dollar shortages is symptomatic of an
            economy that's completely broken down,' Robert Abad, who helps
            oversee $53 billion in emerging-market debt at Western Asset
            Management Co., said yesterday in a telephone interview from
            Pasadena, California. 'This is something that's just incredibly
            unnecessary, very unfortunate, and the victim of all of this is

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Alvaro Saieh hired
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to sell a
            controlling stake in Corpbanca (CORPBANC), according to two people familiar
            with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) is one of the banks they have
            approached, said one of the two people, who asked not to be
            named because the negotiations are private. Santiago-based
            Corpbanca has a market value of $4.22 billion. Saieh and his
            family directly and indirectly own 76 percent of the bank,
            according to its most recent annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau's chief executive officer, Roberto Setubal, told
            analysts on an earning conference call on Nov. 12 that Chile is
            a priority market and that the bank is considering acquisitions
            in Latin America. Neither Corpbanca nor its controler have made
            any agreement to sell all or part of the bank, chief executive
            officer Fernando Massu said today in a statement to the stock
            exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman from Goldman Sachs in New
            York, declined to comment on the transaction, as did Kerrie
            McHugh, a spokeswoman from Bank of America in New York. Itau
            also declined to comment, according to an official who asked not
            to be named in keeping with company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Share Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corpbanca's shares leaped 7.9 percent to 6.60 pesos today
            in Santiago, bringing their gain to 40 percent since reaching a
            low of 4.727 pesos on Aug. 28. The stock is up 3.6 percent so
            far this year, while the IPSA index of Chile's most-traded stock
            has fallen 13.1 percent. Corpbanca's bonds due 2018 have
            returned 0.7 percent this month, beating losses in bonds of
            Banco de Chile, Banco Santander Chile and Banco de Credito
            Inversiones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chilean securities regulation stipulates that a bidder must
            present a public offer to all shareholders of a listed company
            if it's seeking effective control of the target, or if the buyer
            increases an existing stake above two thirds of all shares. If a
            bidder is seeking to buy a non-listed company whose assets are
            mostly stakes in a listed firm, the law will also require it to
            bid for the publicly traded unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh completed the investment of an additional $300
            million in his supermarket chain SMU SA last week after losses
            at the company led it to break debt covenants. SMU's $300
            million of bonds due 2020 have lost 37 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asset Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh sold other assets as he sought to fund the cash
            injection into SMU. Inversiones La Construccion SA said on Oct.
            1 it would pay $170 million in cash and assumed debt for a 67
            percent stake in Corp Group Vida Chile SA, the holding company
            through which Saieh controls two insurers. He also sold 31 bank
            branches for $83 million to Independencia Rentas Inmobiliarias,
            a real estate fund that will lease the space back to Corpbanca. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;El Mostrador website reported today that Corpbanca was in
            talks with four banks, including Itau, over a possible merger
            that would enable Saieh to retain some control over the bank,
            citing a document drawn up by Bank of America. The other banks
            are Banco de Credito e Inversiones, Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) and
            Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, the website said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Tobin, a spokesman for BBVA in Madrid, declined to
            comment. Calls to a press official at BCI weren't immediately

        <headline>Fed Said to Review Commodities at Goldman, Morgan Stanley</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has expanded its
            scrutiny of banks' physical commodities operations to encompass
            businesses run by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS)
            that Congress had previously authorized. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed is examining all legal and regulatory exemptions
            that allow banks to participate in the commodities markets, said
            a person briefed on the process who asked not to be named
            because the review is confidential. The appraisal, intended to
            minimize potential risks to the financial system, widened since
            the Fed said in July that it's reconsidering its landmark 2003
            decision to grant some lenders, such as Citigroup Inc. (C) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co., permission to expand into raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. law restricts banks from owning non-financial
            businesses unless they get special exemptions. Goldman Sachs and
            Morgan Stanley were the two biggest U.S. securities firms until
            they converted into banks in 2008. A 1999 law 'grandfathers'
            any commodities operations they had before Sept. 30, 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The way I read the statute, all commodities activities
            are grandfathered forever, subject to appropriate risk-management controls,' said Randy Guynn, head of the
            financial
            institutions group at law firm Davis Polk Wardwell LLP, whose
            clients include Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            The Federal Reserve is conducting the review while U.S. lawmakers and regulators raise concerns that banks
            might abuse their various roles in commodities markets, such as by coordinating their trading platforms and
            ownership of materials or energy firms to influence prices and profit. Close

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
            Inc. (BRK/A) will get 13.1 million shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            after exercising a warrant tied to a 2008 investment in the Wall
            Street bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares will be delivered on Oct. 4 to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, according to a Business
            Wire statement today
            from the bank. The stake is valued at about $2.1 billion based
            on the $159 closing price today of Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Berkshire becomes the seventh-largest shareholder of
            Goldman Sachs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett,
            Berkshire's chairman and chief executive officer, also got a $5
            billion preferred stake for the original investment, which
            Goldman redeemed in 2011 at a 10 percent premium. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Berkshire can't sell its shares until after the investment
            bank reports third-quarter results this month. Buffett and
            Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein have said that Berkshire
            intends to remain a long-term investor. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nomura Joins Goldman Among Managers of Japan Post's IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. are among firms selected to lead the initial
            public offering of Japan Post Holdings Co. as the government
            sells the country's biggest savings institution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Finance also chose Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
            Stanley (MS) Securities Co. and JPMorgan Chase Co. as the global
            coordinators for the sale of the state-owned postal, banking and
            insurance giant as soon as next year. Daiwa Securities Group
            Inc., Citigroup Inc., UBS AG (UBSN) and four other brokerages will also
            arrange the IPO, the ministry said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction could become one of Japan's biggest IPOs as
            the government implements privatization plans conceived by
            former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's administration in the
            previous decade. Firms leading the offering stand to reap the
            highest fees by advising the ministry on how and when to sell
            the shares in Japan and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a gigantic deal,' said Kazumi Tanaka, an IPO
            analyst at DZH Financial Research Inc. in Tokyo. 'Obtaining the
            mandate is lucrative because of the large fees and the
            additional share sales and deals that would follow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho Securities Co. (8411) and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. were
            also selected to work on the IPO, along with Tokai Tokyo
            Financial Holdings Inc. and Okasan Securities Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will buy an
            8 billion-krone ($1.46 billion) stake in Dong Energy A/S,
            Denmark's largest utility, which is shoring up its balance sheet
            after losing money on failed natural gas bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase will give New York-based Goldman a 19 percent
            stake in Dong, which is controlled by the government, the
            utility said late yesterday. Danish pension funds ATP and PFA
            will pay 2.2 billion kroner and 800 million kroner to buy stakes
            of about 5 percent and 2 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denmark's government, which pulled a planned initial public
            offering of Dong in 2008, said in February it will sell a stake
            in the Skaerbaek, Denmark-based company as writedowns soared.
            Dong yesterday said the parties have agreed to seek an initial
            public offering when conditions 'are right.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new investors have an option to sell their holdings
            back to the government should an IPO not be completed before the
            release of Dong's 2017 financial report, according to today's
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman plans to 'grow the business and provide
            environmentally friendly energy and infrastructure for European
            markets,' Andrew Wolff, head of Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking
            Division in Europe, said in the statement. Goldman is buying
            the stake via funds managed by Wolff's division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Make $1.5 Million Error in Ford Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) mistakenly
            added about $1.5 million of interest costs to a Ford Motor Co. (F)
            bond sale last week by using the wrong Treasury note as a
            benchmark for the security, according to two people with
            knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As compensation, Ford was charged a lower underwriting fee
            for the offering of $1 billion of five-year, 2.875 percent notes
            from its finance unit, said one of the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the information is private. The automaker
            paid 0.1 percentage point less in fees than in two previous
            sales of similar-maturity debt, regulatory filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the sixth-largest underwriter of corporate
            bonds worldwide this year, took Ford public in 1956 and a former
            executive at the bank, John Thornton, sits on the carmaker's
            board. Such an error by the New York-based bank is rare across
            capital markets, said AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB)'s Ashish Shah, who wasn't involved in the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I can't recall the last time something like this
            happened,' said Shah, the head of global credit at New York-based AllianceBernstein, which manages $435
            billion. 'It's a
            reminder that this is a human-led process,' he said. 'It's
            probably something that won't be repeated for a long time at the
            firm.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Three years after returning to investment banking from the National Football League, Anthony Noto
            is tackling his biggest project yet: Twitter Inc.'s initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noto, a
            dot-com era Internet analyst, is Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s head banker on Twitter. The IPO would be
            the largest for a U.S. technology company led by Goldman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            microblogging service publicly released its IPO filing yesterday via the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission, using a $1 billion placeholder amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter is helping Goldman Sachs
            bounce back after the investment bank was trounced by Morgan Stanley for the prime spot on social-media
            deals from LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) to Facebook Inc. (FB) Noto, who co-manages technology investment banking
            with George Lee, has helped drive new deals for New York-based Goldman Sachs since returning to his former
            employer from the NFL, where he was chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The franchise was
            floundering for a bit in the tech IPO market,' said Lise Buyer, a former Internet analyst who now runs Class
            V Group LLC, an IPO consultancy in Portola Valley, California. Now Goldman Sachs is 'clearly giving Morgan a
            run for their money,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Joining Tinkov in $750 Million TCS London IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;TCS Group Holding Plc, the owner of
            Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank, announced plans for a $750 million
            initial public offering in London, set to become this year's
            first Russian company to sell shares in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS is poised to sell between $150 million and $200 million
            in the form of global depositary receipts this quarter,
            according to a statement today from the Russian consumer lender.
            Chairman Oleg Tinkov, who owns of 61 percent of the bank, will
            sell shares, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Baring Vostok
            Capital Partners, Horizon Capital and Vostok Nafta, TCS Chief
            Executive Officer Oliver Hughes said on a conference call. None
            of the selling shareholders is exiting, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tinkov's offering comes after Russian coal miner
            Sibanthracite Plc (SIB) and railroad-freight carrier NTS Holding Plc
            postponed London IPO plans this year. OAO Alrosa, the world's
            biggest diamond producer by output, plans to sell a 16 percent
            stake in Moscow. TCS is seeking to benefit from Russia's growing
            consumer lending market, even as credit risk rises. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're very much an online company that enables investors
            to tap into the Russian consumer,' Hughes said today. 'We have
            a very deep reach into Russia's regions, there's enormous
            potential for growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;San Francisco &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's consumer-finance banks face an increase in bad
            loans in the unsecured retail lending market, Moody's Investors
            Service Inc. said on Sept. 12, noting TCS among those with
            'heightened risks.' Russian bank lending to households rose 34
            percent earlier as of Aug. 1 from a year earlier, while
            unsecured loans rose 39 percent, according to central bank data.
            That is higher than the regulator deems 'comfortable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The branchless bank of Tinkoff Credit is modeled on Capital
            One Financial Corp. (COF) in the U.S., a pioneer of card distribution
            via direct mail, which Tinkov said he encountered while living
            in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hughes said 85 percent of TCS customers live outside Moscow
            and St. Petersburg, Russia's two biggest cities. The bank had
            issued more than 3.5 million credit cards by the end of June,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS Bank's net income in the first half of the year rose to
            $79 million, compared with $52 million in the same period a year
            earlier, it said. Total assets equaled $2.42 billion as of June
            30, with consumer deposits at $977 million and loans to
            customers at $1.95 billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investor Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The London stock market is the front-runner for an IPO
            because there isn't enough liquidity in Moscow and reporting
            rules are too stringent in the U.S., Tinkov said in an interview
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think Tinkoff's IPO will trigger a lot of global
            investor interest,' Vadim Bit-Avragim, who helps manage about
            $4.4 billion at Kapital Asset Management in Moscow, said by
            phone. 'This business is closer to the consumer sector, it has
            fast growth. Tinkov is a well-known businessman, he is very
            active and his views are liked by the investment community.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS sees a 'wide investor base' for the IPO, Hughes said,
            declining to reveal if the lender has any anchor investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB will be
            managing the sale, while JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Renaissance
            Capital will also be joint bookrunners, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            spokesman for Lloyds, declined to comment in an e-mail. Davy is
            advising an overseas institutional investor on the sale,
            according to one of the people. A representative for the firm
            also declined to comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the Ulysses properties previously belonged to Liam
            Carroll, one of the country's biggest developers during its
            real-estate bubble, who has seen many of his properties seized
            by banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyds decided three years ago to close the Irish unit it
            acquired as part of its 2008 takeover of HBOS Plc and sell or
            run off the assets. The bank has taken 12.5 billion pounds ($20
            billion) of impairment charges on Irish loans since the nation's
            real-estate market collapsed in 2008, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman-Backed Essent Adds Wells Fargo as IPO Underwriter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), the mortgage
            insurer backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and billionaire
            George Soros, added Wells Fargo Co., its largest customer, to
            the group of underwriters for an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, accounted for 17
            percent of Essent's sales in the first six months of this year,
            according to a regulatory filing today from the Bermuda-based
            insurer. The firm also added Bank of America Corp., the third-largest mortgage originator, as an
            underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurance, which covers losses when borrowers
            default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs, is typically
            selected by originators. Essent was founded amid the financial
            crisis, when record homeowner defaults pushed some rivals from
            the business. As home prices rise, firms that survived are
            attracting investors looking for ways to bet on housing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'New capital would help fund Essent's continued growth,'
            Helen Remeza, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said in a
            Sept. 23 research note. 'A capital raise could also further
            differentiate Essent Guaranty from its more weakly capitalized
            peers with legacy exposures.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo (WFC) is the only customer to account for more than
            10 percent of Essent's revenue, according to the filing. New
            York-based Goldman Sachs is leading the offering, with JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), the No. 2 mortgage lender, and Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Midnight Madness Scene: Goldman Fights Morgan for Charity</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Almost 300 people in finance wandered
            the streets of Manhattan this weekend in the all-night puzzle
            competition 'Midnight Madness.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From sunset Saturday night to around 2 p.m. on Sunday, 30
            teams of 10 tapped on gravestones, assembled an electronic piano
            and decoded countless ciphers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The competition, in its second year, lets young
            professionals raise money for charity while showing off their
            skills in problem-solving. The challenges are in development for
            months and feature dozens of clues, cues, keys and experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a combination of solving puzzles and figuring out
            the quirky, twisted stuff that goes on in the minds of Game
            Control,' said Dan Sharfman, captain of Black Gold,
            representing the commodities group at Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Game Control consisted of more than 50 people assembled by
            Goldman partner Elisha Wiesel, who founded the 'Madness' and
            is the son of Elie Wiesel, as well as event producer Lindsi
            Shine, and game designers Mat Laibowitz and Dan Michaelson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Their headquarters was Big Daddy's Diner in the East 20s,
            where the hint-givers included Alan Solomon, who played the
            character that planned 'The Great Allnighter' in the 1980 film
            'Midnight Madness.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The entry fee is $50,000. Employees of Citigroup Inc. (C),
            Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS) turned to their senior managers for
            donations. Citigroup's global markets team orchestrated stunts,
            such as paying to throw a pie at your boss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Money Raised &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The result: $2.9 million raised for Good Shepherd Services,
            which cares for the poor in New York City. It was more than
            double the proceeds from last year's inaugural event. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I live close to Red Hook and knowing these guys are
            engaged there in housing and health care makes this
            meaningful,' said Shahzad Ali of the prime services group at
            Goldman and a member of team 0xff00, which won last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The competition began in the parking lot of an abandoned
            Pathmark near the Manhattan Bridge. The Alphanauts, a team of
            Connecticut hedge-funders, arrived after dining at Nobu. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hints and the clues led teams around the city from Pier
            25 in Hudson River Park to the roof of a private event space and
            New York Marble Cemetery in the East Village. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The West Coast Burninators, with some high-tech types who
            tackle puzzles like this on a regular basis, came in first.
            Teams crossed over a miniature bridge printed with the word
            'Finish,' located at 7 World Trade Center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exhausted, many saw the open arms of Sister Paulette
            LoMonaco, the head of Good Shepherd Services, who was ready with
            hugs and bagels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The connection with 'Midnight Madness' is that every day
            we are working to solve the puzzle of extreme poverty,' Sister
            Paulette said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Richard Meier Boost $149 Million Newark Project</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Newark, New Jersey, is home to one
            of the poorest downtowns in the U.S., a once-exuberant
            commercial retail corridor where many'old movie palaces, ornate
            department stores and grimy storefronts stand empty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Property is cheap because real-estate profits seem elusive.
            Developers aren't flocking here. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, a convention-defying $149 million project called
            Teachers Village is in progress, aided by a long view and deep
            pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ron Beit, chief executive officer of Newark-based developer
            RBH Group LLC, is leading a group of well-known investors behind
            three charter schools and residential buildings with
            $800'apartments. Pritzker Prize-winning'Richard Meier is the
            architect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a U.S. Senate candidate, and
            Governor Chris Christie, a possible presidential contender,
            thought the project important enough to participate in its Sept.
            25 ribbon cutting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hope is that good schools, inexpensive housing and
            well-chosen retail tenants would bring activity to the
            neighborhood, eventually a full-blown revival and further down
            the road the prospect of profits from additional 15 million
            square feet of mixed-use space. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Great Access &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They understood the value proposition,' Beit said, 'and
            that land is too cheap in Newark considering its assets and
            access to the Northeast Corridor'' -- the Boston, New York,
            Washington rail line. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investors include Nicolas Berggruen of Berggruen
            Holdings Inc., Warren Lichtenstein of Steel Partners LLC,
            Frederick Iseman of CI Capital Partners LLC and Jeffrey Gould's
            BRT Realty Trust. (BRT) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The blue-chip lineup attracted Goldman Sachs, which made a
            $27 million senior loan. Local, state and federal government
            sources added several varieties of tax credits and subsidized
            bonds to the developers' $14 million in equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meier supplied the project's master plan, doing without the
            sculptural gymnastics he's known for -- at the Getty Museum in
            Los Angeles and elsewhere -- to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm designed a clean-lined four-story box, one of the
            first two buildings that have opened for the present school
            term. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rough and smooth brick patterns echo a mix of clear and
            translucent glass to make a surface composition as rich as a
            Mondrian painting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nice Windows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two charter schools perch above street-level stores.
            Impeccably proportioned windows pour daylight into the
            classrooms of the 500-student Spark Charter Academy through
            alternating clear and translucent panels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike most inner city schools, there are no bars on these
            windows. The cheerful interiors were designed by KSS Architects
            of Princeton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 75 students of the Discovery Charter School, which
            covers grades four through eight, share a large open space
            painted lavender and dotted with houseplants. A girl named Kayla
            described an 'amazing' curriculum that focuses on the basics
            while leaving time for botany and cooking skills. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KSS also designed a six-story red-brick building across the
            street for the middle school students of the Great Oak Charter
            School, which depends heavily on college graduates to tutor
            students. There's also a yet-to-open daycare center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The KSS design lacks Meier's unerring sense of proportion
            and attention to detail and is worrisomely bare-bones inside. A
            windowless fire stair is the chief way students move from floor
            to floor. A caged exercise rooftop is a grim place to blow off
            steam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oddly, none of the schools has a ground-level playground in
            spite of an abundance of nearby parking lots. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Playgrounds Please &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this can change by the time some 1,000 children
            attend the schools and daycare center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New shops Beit is building will appeal to parents, and
            eventually to residents, when 200 rental apartments aimed at
            teachers are completed. Steel is rising on the first two of
            those buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beit avoided the national chains that lazy lenders prefer.
            He signed leases likely to make Teachers Village a destination,
            such as Harlem cupcake store Tonnie's Minis and Chicken Jones, a
            casual restaurant created by Manhattan restaurateur Michael Vann. Those magnetic tenancies should fill
            surrounding
            storefronts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I asked Beit how he financed quality architecture and
            unique rentals in a city developers shun. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He praised early partners who bought land -- not just for
            Teachers Village, but to eventually accommodate 8,000 residences
            and millions of commercial square feet that are in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beit'and his investors will really cash in if Teachers
            Village proves to be a'catalyst for a broader Newark revival and
            the land they've banked rises in'value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Creating financial components that made investors
            stretch, but were not totally out of the realm of what they were
            used to, added layers of complexity,' Beit said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Entrenched Poverty &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He does not see financing such a catalytic mix getting any
            easier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's too bad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Struggling communities can almost never tap Wall Street
            stars and celebrated architects. Yet these are the places most
            in need of such transformational investment, not the
            opportunistic junk they usually get stuck with (think casinos)
            that fails to ease entrenched poverty. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Shares Decline as Revenue Falls Most Among Peers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) declined
            2.4 percent in New York trading after revenue dropped the most
            among the biggest Wall Street banks and fixed-income results
            were the worst since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter revenue of $6.72 billion was 20 percent lower
            than a year earlier and fell short of the $7.35 billion average
            estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bond trading
            plunged 47 percent to $1.29 billion, the New York-based company
            said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
            expenses 25 percent in the quarter to offset falling revenue,
            including a 35 percent reduction in compensation. The firm was
            the only major bank to post a decline in equities trading, and
            revenue compared with the second quarter dropped in three of the
            company's four business units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income revenue 'looks very weak, and surprisingly,
            it looks clearly weaker than its peers,' said Richard Staite, a
            bank analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. 'It's more than just
            weak client trading, it looks like. They could've been badly
            positioned in the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to $158.32 at 4:15 p.m. in New York.
            The stock had gained 27 percent this year through yesterday
            after advancing 41 percent in 2012. The shares have traded below
            1.5 times book value for the past 3 1/2 years, the longest such
            streak in the company's history. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sets Aside Smaller Share for Banker Pay</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, set aside a
            smaller portion for staff pay in the first nine months of the year than in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation,
            which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, fell 5
            percent to $10.4 billion in the first three quarters from a year earlier, the New York-based company said
            today in a statement. Revenue in the same period increased 2 percent to $25.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, allocated 41 percent of revenue, down from 44 percent in the first
            nine months of 2012, as he seeks to boost returns. Last year, the firm cut expenses in the fourth quarter,
            bringing the total pay pool to 38 percent of revenue, the second-lowest figure since Goldman Sachs has been
            a public company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compensation expense is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs's
            32,600 employees $319,755 for the nine months. The firm set aside $11 billion in the same period of 2012,
            equal to an average $336,442 for each of the 32,600 people employed by Goldman Sachs at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Compensation for corporate and investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest U.S.
            lender, fell 4.4 percent in the first nine months from a year earlier. The $8.69 billion represented 31
            percent of revenue at the unit, which was created last year when the company combined its investment bank
            with the corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts Costs, Boosts Dividend as Revenue Tumbles 20%</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the world's most profitable securities firm before the financial crisis,
            said earnings were little changed as the bank cut costs in response to a 20 percent drop in revenue. The
            firm increased its dividend 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company fell as revenue of $6.72
            billion fell short of the $7.35 billion average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Third-quarter
            net income rose to $1.52 billion, or $2.88 a share, from $1.51 billion, or $2.85, a year earlier, the New
            York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
            Blankfein, 59, is lowering expenses to show investors his firm can deliver higher returns while it waits on
            a cyclical climb in trading and investment-banking revenue that hasn't arrived. The stock has traded below
            1.5 times book value for the past 3 1/2 years, the longest such streak in the company's history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman typically outperforms, and cost controls help for the time being,' Keith Davis, an analyst
            at Farr, Miller Washington LLC, which manages more than $900 million, said before the results were
            announced. 'We're still optimistic, though the third quarter wasn't a home run by any means.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined 3 percent to $157.47 at 7:50 a.m. in New York. The stock had gained 27
            percent this year through yesterday after advancing 41 percent in 2012. The shares are still below their
            pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Vice Chairman to Step Down at End of Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said J. Michael Evans, a vice chairman who ran emerging markets and
            was
            seen as a potential successor to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, is retiring after more than 20
            years at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, 56, will step down at the end of the year and become
            a senior director, the New York-based company said today in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans ran businesses including the securities division,
            equity trading and equity-capital markets in a career that
            featured positions in New York, London and Hong Kong. In 2011,
            he was named to lead the emerging-markets units as part of
            Blankfein's push to be 'Goldman Sachs in more places.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Michael's deep commitment to the firm, his unrelenting
            focus on our clients and his broad global market knowledge have
            left an extraordinary mark at Goldman Sachs,' Blankfein, 59,
            said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, one of four vice chairmen among the bank's executive
            officers, led with E. Gerald Corrigan the business-standards
            committee, a group set up in 2010 to review policies and
            practices after Goldman Sachs was sued by the Securities and
            Exchange Commission for misleading investors on a 2007 sale of a
            mortgage-linked investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After that appointment, Evans was seen as a potential
            successor to Blankfein along with President Gary Cohn, the
            Financial Times wrote in 2010. Goldman Sachs paid Cohn 12
            percent more than Evans's $17 million for 2012, the first time
            since the financial crisis that Blankfein's deputies were given
            differing compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Blankfein's Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein told Bloomberg Television earlier this year that
            he had no plans to leave after seven years in the top job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The combination of this being who I am and what I do and
            having absolutely no other interests makes me think this is what
            I'll be doing for a while,' Blankfein said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, a Canadian, graduated from Princeton University in
            1981. He won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1984, the same
            year he earned a master's degree from Oxford University. Evans
            was named a partner in 1994, a year after he joined Goldman
            Sachs from Salomon Brothers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans owns about $230 million of Goldman Sachs stock,
            according to an April filing, which counts vested options, stock
            awards and family trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2001, he became co-head of the equities business and
            rose to co-head of the firm's securities division, which
            includes all trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Conflicts, Transparency &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans was named chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific in
            2004, moving to Hong Kong, where he helped develop the bank's
            business in China and its relationship with Industrial
            Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398) The firm sold its remaining stake
            in ICBC this year after posting more than $3.4 billion of gains
            from the investment. Evans was named a vice chairman in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business-standards committee produced a report in
            January 2011 that laid out 39 recommendations to improve
            practices in areas such as conflicts of interest and
            transparency. In May of this year, the firm released a report
            about the actions it took in implementing the recommendations
            and the impact they had. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We spent more than 100,000 hours training our people not
            only on the things that had changed, but teaching them how these
            changes were going to be implemented and driven down through the
            organization,' Evans said in an interview in May. The efforts
            were aimed at 'making sure they stick and that they're embraced
            by the totality of our population.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>KKR to Goldman Skirmish for Scraps as LBO Bankruptcy Looms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co., Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and TPG Capital, the firms that led the $48 billion buyout
            of Energy Future Holdings Corp. in 2007, are fighting to receive barely 3 percent of their initial
            investment when the power generator files for bankruptcy as soon as this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negotiations
            with senior creditors including Leon Black's Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) and Centerbridge Capital
            Partners LLC, which are poised to seize control of the former TXU Corp., are at a crucial juncture today
            when agreements that allow them to view nonpublic information to foster talks expire. A proposal disclosed
            last week that wasn't accepted would have given the company's owners as little as $270 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR, Goldman and TPG took Dallas-based Energy Future private in the largest leveraged buyout in
            history, an investment that was predicated on rising gas prices. Instead, they fell as the development of
            hydraulic fracturing created a surge in U.S. gas supplies, triggering 10 straight quarterly losses at the
            company since 2011 and leading Warren Buffett to say his $2 billion investment in Energy Future bonds was 'a
            big mistake.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We see bigger potential for value leakage if this bankruptcy
            restructuring turns highly contentious, highly litigious and disorganized,' Jim Hempstead, an analyst at
            bond-rating company Moody's Investors Service in New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dubai Property-Bubble Concerns Overdone, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Concerns that Dubai's property
            market is a bubble are exaggerated as new regulations focused on
            curbing speculation and an increasing supply helps keep values
            down, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Property prices are 36 percent below their 2008 peak even
            after rising by about a third from a low in the second quarter
            of 2011, analysts including Eyad Faraj, Matija Gergolet and
            Harsh Mehta wrote in a report published today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai home values climbed at the fastest pace in the world
            in the second quarter, a survey by broker Knight Frank LLP
            showed, stoking concern that the market may be overheating. The
            increases will slow down over the next 12 months after the
            return of speculators sparked 'unsustainable' gains, Jones
            Lang LaSalle Inc. said in an Oct. 3 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The surge prompted the sheikhdom's Land Department to
            double property registration fees to 4 percent starting Oct. 6.
            The real estate regulator is requiring developers to set aside a
            portion of a project's costs to limit the effect of advance
            sales in financing construction. Restrictions on mortgage
            lending, expected from the United Arab Emirates central bank
            this year, will also help cool the market, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Political Stability &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai's relative political stability and high rental yields
            of 5 percent to 6 percent will maintain its attractiveness to
            investors, according to Goldman. That compares with global
            yields of 2 percent to 3 percent, the analysts wrote. Last year,
            approximately 34 percent of Dubai's property investors were from
            South Asia, followed by 15 percent from Arab countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In neighboring Abu Dhabi, residential prices have
            stabilized and rents are increasing in the best areas, helped by
            the relocation of around 10,000 state employees from Dubai in
            the past eight months, the analysts estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi's government in Sept. 2012 required all its
            employees and those of state-related companies to live in the
            capital to receive housing allowances. The law sparked the
            relocation of workers who for years had commuted from Dubai
            where they enjoyed lower rents and better infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR) had its rating raised two levels to
            BB at Standard Poor's with a stable outlook, the ratings
            company said in a statement today. The rating is two levels
            below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aldar, Abu Dhabi's largest developer, is taking a more
            cautious approach to new projects, aims to increase sources of
            recurring income and is reducing its debt, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Ordered to Advance Ex-Programmer Fees in NY Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) must
            advance computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov the legal fees he
            needs to fight New York state charges that he stole confidential
            source code from the company, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs at this time doesn't have to pay the fees
            Aleynikov incurred defending federal charges that led to his
            conviction and imprisonment before the verdict was overturned,
            said U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in Newark, New Jersey. He
            said the two sides must engage in a pretrial exchange of
            evidence on that question. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Immediate advancement of fees is required, subject only
            to an unsecured undertaking to repay them if the applicant is
            unsuccessful in the underlying litigation,' McNulty said in an
            opinion made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted in federal court in Manhattan in
            2010 of stealing hundreds of thousands of lines of code and
            sentenced to 97 months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was ordered freed in February 2012 when the U.S. Court
            of Appeals in New York reversed his conviction. In August of
            that year, he was arraigned in Manhattan on state charges of
            unlawful use of scientific material and duplication of computer-related material. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vice President &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which employed Aleynikov from May 2007
            through June 2009, argued that it didn't have to pay Aleynikov's
            fees in his state prosecution because he wasn't an officer of
            the company, even though he was a vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McNulty disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It may be the case that Goldman (or the industry of which
            it is a part) has been profligate in conferring the title of
            vice president,' the judge wrote. 'If so, Goldman must bear
            the consequences of that profligacy. Goldman might easily have
            chosen to be more sparing with job titles, or to confer them in
            some other way.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's attorney Kevin Marino said he will proceed with
            evidence exchanges on the question of whether Goldman Sachs must
            indemnify his client for the federal case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs used its considerable power and influence
            to procure Mr. Aleynikov's prosecution for crimes he did not
            commit,' Marino said in an interview. 'It is only fitting that
            Goldman should now be forced to bear the cost of his restoring
            his reputation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 12-cv-05994, U.S. District Court, District of
            New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Seek Up to $402 Million in LEG Share Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., which took
            LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) public in February, may raise as much as 294
            million euros ($402 million) by selling 7 million shares of the
            German landlord, a person with knowledge of the transaction said
            yesterday. LEG fell as much as 5.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman offered the shares at 41 euros to 42 euros each,
            said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            information isn't public. The shares were owned by Whitehall
            Street Real Estate, a Goldman Sachs money manager, and Perry
            Capital. Goldman is also managing the share sale, the person
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, Germany's second-largest property company by market
            value, was sold in the biggest initial public offering of a
            German real estate company. Goldman raised 1.3 billion euros in
            that deal, which left Whitehall with 41 percent of the shares
            and Perry with a 9 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG fell 4.1 percent to 41.80 euros at 9:20 a.m. in
            Frankfurt trading. The shares have dropped about 5.6 percent
            since the IPO, while the EPRA/FTSE Nareit Index of German
            property stocks has slid 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the IPO, 30.5 million shares were sold at 44 euros
            each. Before the offering, Whitehall held 95 percent of the
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, based in Dusseldorf, owns about 91,000 apartments in
            North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Open Broker-Dealer in Mexico Next Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will open a
            local broker-dealer in Mexico early next year as part of its
            expansion in Latin America, said Stephen Scherr, the firm's
            chief for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move will allow Goldman Sachs to trade in peso-denominated securities, Scherr said today in a
            broadcast on the
            firm's website. The New York-based investment bank won
            authorization for a Mexican brokerage unit last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a very bullish view on Mexico,' said Scherr, 49,
            who is also global head of the company's financing group. 'We
            have a very strong presence in Mexico City, and in fact, by the
            early part of next year, we'll have a local broker-dealer in the
            country.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
            opened a local office in Santiago, Chile, earlier this year.
            Foreign companies with Mexican brokerages include Morgan Stanley (MS)
            and Credit Suisse Group AG, according to the Mexican Association
            of Brokerages. Citigroup Inc. (C)'s Banamex unit also owns a major
            brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reforms planned by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto,
            who was elected last year, and efforts to develop the country's
            capital markets will probably attract investors, Scherr said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anytime a market can become larger, deeper, more liquid,
            like what the Mexicans are doing, it is inevitably to the
            benefit of the economy, because I think the market will
            demonstrate greater price rationality, and will attract more and
            more investors to that market,' he said. 'It is why we're
            going there in bigger size.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sold LEG Immobilien Shares Valued at $395 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which took
            LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) public in February, raised 289 million euros
            ($395 million) by selling 7 million shares of the German
            landlord. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares, owned by Goldman's Whitehall Street Real Estate
            and co-investor Perry Capital, were priced at 41.25 euros each,
            Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. The stake represents
            about 13 percent of LEG's share capital, according to the
            statement. Goldman managed the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, Germany's second-largest property company by market
            value, was sold in the biggest initial public offering of a
            German real estate company. Goldman raised 1.3 billion euros in
            the deal, which left Whitehall with 41 percent of the shares and
            Perry with 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG fell as much as 5.2 percent in Frankfurt trading. There
            shares were down 4.6 percent to 41.56 euros at 11:27 a.m.
            They've have dropped about 5.6 percent since the IPO, while the
            EPRA/FTSE Nareit Index of German property stocks has slid 1.3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the IPO, 30.5 million shares were sold at 44 euros
            each. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, based in Dusseldorf, owns about 91,000 apartments in
            North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blackstone, GIC Buy Stake in Goldman's European Insurer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP and GIC Pte,
            Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, agreed to buy a majority
            stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s European insurance business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world's biggest private-equity firm, and
            GIC will each buy 28.5 percent of the shares in Rothesay Life
            Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, Goldman Sachs said in a statement
            today.
            Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. will also buy 7 percent,
            and Goldman will retain 36 percent. The price wasn't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is more capital efficient for Goldman Sachs to share
            its ownership with other investors,' said Michael Sherwood,
            vice chairman of New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in the
            statement. 'Rothesay Life can continue its growth as a
            standalone business with the benefit of diversified ownership.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures about 12 billion pounds ($19.4 billion) of
            insurance contracts for companies including IAG SA's British
            Airways and General Motors Co. (GM)'s U.K. division. Firms such as
            Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a
            certain age and use derivatives to hedge the risk. The insurer
            typically receives a portion of the pension plan's assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in August that it planned to sell a
            majority stake in Rothesay, which has about $9.66 billion in
            assets, in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent
            capital rules. The bank has already sold about 80 percent of
            Global Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in
            Bermuda, to institutions and high-net-worth clients this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Strong Pipeline' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loudiadis said in the statement that diversifying
            Rothesay's shareholder base was the next stage in the company's
            strategy, adding that the insurer will continue to work on a
            'strong pipeline' of opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chad Pike, Blackstone (BX)'s head of tactical opportunities in
            Europe, said in the statement that Rothesay was 'well placed'
            to benefit from the growth potential in the U.K. pension
            insurance market as interest rates climb. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tay Lim Hock, president of GIC's Special Investment. said
            the fund sees 'long-term potential' of the expanding market
            for Rothesay's pension-insurance business. GIC is the world's
            eighth-biggest state fund with an estimated $248 billion of
            assets under management, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund
            Institute's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mass. Mutual, which invested 100 million pounds in
            subordinated debt in Rothesay earlier this year, said demand for
            risk management from U.K. defined-benefit pension plans offered
            significant growth opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory and
            antitrust approvals, which includes the U.K.'s Prudential
            Regulation Authority, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Hires Citigroup's Smith as Asia Electronic Trading Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            hired Ian M. Smith from Citigroup (C) Inc. as head of electronic
            trading for the Asia-Pacific region as the U.S. firm seeks to
            expand its system globally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith, most recently head of execution trading for the
            region at Citigroup, will be a managing director, said Connie
            Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs. The
            hiring follows the departure of Shuya Kekke, former co-head of
            electronic trading, from Goldman Sachs earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith becomes the fifth senior electronic trading
            specialist the Wall Street firm has recruited in the region in
            the past two years, spanning from Japan to Australia, Ling said.
            New York-based Goldman Sachs spent a year developing an
            electronic trading system for corporate bonds called GSessions
            that started operating in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been building out our electronic trading platform
            in Asia, tripling the number of clients on the algorithmic
            customization platform and adding access to three new markets in
            the past year,' Canute Dalmasse, Asia-Pacific head of execution
            services, wrote in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith will be based in Hong Kong, Ling said. Before
            Citigroup, he worked at Credit Suisse Group AG and led the
            development of the Swiss bank's algorithmic trading strategies
            and related product development, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James Griffiths, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Citigroup,
            declined to comment on Smith's departure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) are among securities
            firms that bought execution-management systems starting in the
            mid-2000s to give clients including mutual funds access to
            exchanges and algorithms, or trading strategies that allow them
            to process larger orders in small pieces over a preset period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has added six people to its Asia electronic
            trading team in the past three months, including Kekke. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Cohn Says He Doesn't Know Why FICC Unit Underperformed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
            Gary Cohn said while he doesn't know what drove his firm's
            underperformance in fixed-income trading in the third quarter,
            he's vowing to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't know precisely why we had a tough quarter, but
            the results are in, and I can tell you we had a tough quarter in
            fixed-income,' Cohn said today in a Bloomberg Television
            interview with Stephanie Ruhle. 'We're very committed, we're
            going to redouble or triple our efforts in fixed-income. We
            believe ourselves to be a very powerful, very dominant, top-tier
            fixed-income shop.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported last week that fixed-income,
            currency and commodities, or FICC, trading revenue dropped 47
            percent to $1.29 billion, the lowest since the financial crisis.
            The firm's share of revenue among the five largest Wall Street
            banks is 17 percent so far this year, down from 22 percent in
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve's decision not to taper its stimulus
            efforts didn't cause a big change for the firm's business, Cohn,
            53, said. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last week
            that clients were cautious leading up to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For Goldman, it meant business as usual,' Cohn said.
            'Not tapering is the world that we've been in for the last
            year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Efforts to improve in fixed-income will include hiring, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're looking for seasoned traders, we're replenishing
            our trading supply,' Cohn said. 'We're looking for seasoned
            salespeople, salespeople who have real client relationships and
            can come in and help us manage our client relationships.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Raises $226 Million by Selling Shares in TCS IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised $226
            million selling stock in TCS Group Holding Plc (TCS)'s initial public
            offering yesterday, cashing out almost two-thirds of its stake
            in the Russian consumer lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank, through its ELQ Investors II unit,
            sold 12.9 million of its 21 million shares, reducing its stake
            from 12 percent to 4.5 percent. A spokesman for the New York-based company declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is vying to compete with Russia's leading
            foreign investment banks such as Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup
            Inc. by using the more than $1 billion it invested in private
            equity since 2007 as leverage to win deals and woo the Kremlin
            for roles in asset sales. Goldman Sachs bought stakes in Russian
            companies on condition that it gets equity and debt mandates
            later, a person familiar with the deals said in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's nothing sinister here,' Jason Hurwitz, senior
            banking analyst at Alfa Bank, said today in a phone interview.
            'It is not the first time Goldman Sachs has shown greater
            foresight than other investment banks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS priced the IPO at $17.50 a global depositary receipt,
            valuing the firm at $3.2 billion. The GDRs fell 0.8 percent to
            $18.15 today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and other investment banks managing the sale
            may benefit from selling as much as $163 million in additional
            shares, TCS said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Branchless Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS, founded as Tinkoff Credit Systems in 2007 by serial
            entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, has issued more than 2 million cards
            in Russia and now ranks fifth in lending, according to the
            company. The branchless bank is modeled on McLean, Virginia-based Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which
            pioneered the
            distribution of credit cards through direct mail, which Tinkov
            said he learned about firsthand while living in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tinkov has created and sold businesses including a retail
            electronics chain, frozen-food producer brewery and restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired its initial 10 percent holding in
            Tinkoff in October 2007, according to a prospectus. In 2008,
            Swedish fund Vostok Nafta Investment Ltd. became a shareholder,
            and Baring Vostok, Russia's most successful private equity firm,
            and Ukraine's Horizon Capital bought stakes last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IPO, the largest by a Russian company in 11 months,
            values the lender at 4 to 5 times book value, according to
            Natalia Berezina, banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. OAO
            Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, trades at about 1.3 times
            book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Heightened Risks' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's consumer-finance banks face an increase in bad
            loans in the unsecured retail-lending market and TCS is among
            those with 'heightened risks,' Moody's Investors Service said
            in a Sept. 12 report. Russian bank lending to households rose 34
            percent as of Aug. 1 from a year earlier, while unsecured loans
            surged 39 percent, according to central bank data. That's higher
            than the regulator deems 'comfortable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is 'an unique story, but in my opinion in current
            conditions of overheated consumer lending, Central Bank
            regulations, rising asset-quality problems and general cost of
            equity for Russia and Russian banks, it's still too high a price
            for Tinkoff,' Berezina, who values TCS at $1.6 billion, said in
            e-mailed comments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Scene Last Night: Goldman's Evans, Ruscha, Whitney Nudes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The naked men and women at the Whitney Museum of American Art gala stood on a platform surrounded
            by luggage from sponsor Louis Vuitton. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the fully clothed last night were Citadel
            LLC Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin; J. Michael Evans, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice chairman who
            will leave his post at year's end; and William Ruprecht, the CEO of Sotheby's. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guests
            looked on as artists sketched the models, capturing the curve of an arm or a fine rump resting on the
            trunks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one gawked too long during the party held at Skylight at Moynihan Station,
            which raised more than $2.7 million. There were just too many distractions, from the strips of bacon being
            served at the bar (crispy, not caramelized, by the way), to greeting Leonard Lauder, one of the Whitney's
            biggest patrons. There were also chances to spot actress Michelle Williams, dealer Larry Gagosian and
            honoree Ed Ruscha. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the evening, Ruscha was sketching a portrait of Salman
            Rushdie's girlfriend, Missy Brody, fully clothed. She provided Ruscha with a notebook -- every guest
            received one at their place setting along with a Sharpie. Ruscha made a text portrait. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During
            dinner, the artist received a gift from the Whitney: a booklet titled 'A Few Various Colorful People and a
            Glass of Milk,' filled with personal notes collected for the occasion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Aunt Gertie &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said he would read every page, then made a joke about the Metropolitan Museum of Art renting
            space at 'Aunt Gertie's boardinghouse' -- the Whitney's uptown building, being vacated next year when it
            moves to the Meatpacking District. 'Gertie' of course is Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who founded the museum
            after the Met turned down a gift of hundreds of paintings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ruscha got to choose the
            musical entertainment: David Byrne, who serenaded guests with three songs including 'I Should Watch TV,'
            from his album with St. Vincent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goody bag offered a copy of the album as well as a
            copy of Ruscha's book 'They Called Her Styrene,' donated by the owners of Phaidon Press, Apollo Global
            Management LLC (APO)'s Leon Black and his wife, Debra Black. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the after party,
            watching artists sketch live models was replaced by a photo booth where people could pose with signs showing
            phrases from Ruscha paintings, such as: 'Headlights Are Similar to People's Eyes' and 'Those of Us Who Have
            Double Parked.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The guests here included actresses Taylor Schilling, who stars in
            'Orange Is the New Black,' and Zoe Kravitz. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Amanda Gordon is a writer and photographer

            Group Inc.'s London-based co-head of commodities trading, is
            leaving the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shenouda joined the firm in 1999 and became a partner in
            2008, according to an internal memo from Pablo Salame and
            Isabelle Ealet, co-heads of the trading division. Michael DuVally, a company spokesman, confirmed the
            contents of the memo
            and declined to elaborate. Gregory A. Agran is Shenouda's New
            York-based co-head. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is among banks whose ability to participate
            in the commodities markets is being examined by the Federal
            Reserve. The Fed is conducting a review while U.S. lawmakers and
            regulators raise concerns that banks might abuse their various
            roles in physical commodities markets, or that the businesses
            pose risks to the firms' financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a long, long investment in the commodity
            business, and we have at this stage no intention of selling our
            business,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in a
            conference call this month after Goldman Sachs reported third-quarter results. 'We're very committed to our
            clients here. And
            so we'll just work with the regulators.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shenouda previously ran the New York-based bank's European
            crude oil and products trading unit and its European gas and
            power trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He has been responsible for driving several key
            acquisitions, as well as the expansion of our business
            activities into new regions and products, including the build-out of our energy, coal, freight and emissions
            franchise,'
            Ealet and Salame wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spark Spread reported on the departure earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Loaned Banco Espirito Santo Funds in July</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) loaned
            Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo SA $835 million in July, just
            weeks before the group's units sought creditor protection in a
            cascade of insolvencies that resulted in the lender's bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made the loan through Oak Finance Luxembourg
            SA, an investment company that raised funds destined for a
            Venezuelan oil refinery project, according to the unit's offer
            document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo, once Portugal's biggest publicly
            traded lender by market value, was bailed out Aug. 3 after it
            disclosed potential losses on loans to other Grupo Espirito
            Santo companies and regulators ordered the lender to raise more
            capital. The bank was split in two with deposits and healthy
            assets becoming Novo Banco in a bailout by the central bank's
            Resolution Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Goldman
            Sachs sold some of Oak Finance's securities at a loss to hedge
            funds and the New York-based firm is still holding some of the
            debt, citing a person it didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An official for Goldman Sachs in London declined to
            comment. Novo Banco does not comment about operations that
            involve clients, said a spokeswoman, who asked not to be named
            in line with company policy. Officials for Portugal's central
            bank didn't have an immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had agreed to the funding on May 16, the
            offer document shows. Four days later, Banco Espirito Santo
            warned investors buying stock in its rights offer of
            irregularities in the accounts of a parent company and that the
            'serious financial situation' of the parent firm could be
            damaging to the bank's reputation. Regulators are examining how
            the group's companies helped fund each other. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International, the
            European division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), said first-half
            pretax profit fell 60 percent, hurt by a charge linked to
            employee compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pretax profit dropped to $335.4 million in the first six
            months of the year from $847.5 million in the year-earlier
            period, the company said in a filing. Revenue fell 5 percent to
            $3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Administrative expenses rose to $2.5 billion from $2.1
            billion, due to a $516 million charge as the company marked the
            value of stock-based compensation to market prices. Shares of
            the New York-based parent have climbed more than 19 percent so
            far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue from institutional client services, the fixed
            income, currencies and commodities division, fell 11 percent to
            $2.2 billion, while investment banking revenue climbed 41
            percent to $591.4 million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is the top-ranked mergers
            adviser in Western Europe, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The firm is advising Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) on its 7.7
            billion euro ($10.2 billion) takeover offer for German cable
            company Kabel Deutschland Holding AG. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Bernstein to Lead Venture Capital Client Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the top
            global merger adviser this year, named Stuart Bernstein as head
            of a group that focuses on venture capital investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernstein, a partner who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986, will
            remain global head of the clean technology and renewables group,
            according to a memo from investment banking co-heads Richard J. Gnodde, 53, David Solomon, 51, and John S.
            Weinberg, 56. David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed the
            contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The venture capital community has become a strategically
            important constituent of the division's client franchise and is
            critical to our ability to serve the needs of our emerging
            growth clients,' according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernstein, 49, previously ran the equity underwriting group
            that serves financial institutions, according to the memo. He
            became a managing director in 1999 and a partner the next year.
            As head of clean technology, Bernstein has led Goldman Sachs's
            effort to finance $40 billion of renewable energy in a decade,
            which began last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Frank L. Walters led the venture capital group before
            taking the same role at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
            America Corp. earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top adviser on announced global
            mergers this year and the leading equity underwriter, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank is the third-ranked
            adviser on global technology deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bridgepoint Hires Goldman Sachs for Sale of Dutch Textbook Firm</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bridgepoint Advisers Ltd. hired
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to oversee a potential sale of Dutch
            textbook publisher Noordhoff Uitgevers, just as the government
            tries to rein in the cost of school materials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The private-equity firm will separate Noordhoff from the
            group of education assets it acquired from Wolters Kluwer NV (WKL),
            said two people with knowledge of the talks, who asked not to be
            identified because the London-based firm hasn't made the process
            public. The firm paid about 774 million euros ($1 billion) for
            the businesses in 2007 and renamed the group Infinitas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs has been appointed to help explore
            strategic options' for Noordhoff Uitgevers, Infinitas said in
            an e-mailed statement today. Officials at Bridgepoint and
            Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dutch undersecretary for education yesterday announced
            plans to stop funding free textbooks for secondary school
            pupils. From 2015, parents will be required to pay as much as
            300 euros a year for books. Noordhoff sells textbooks for Dutch
            children to use from primary school through university. The
            company has 355 employees and has also developed study kits used
            on the iPad, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
            plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
            to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
            after 10 years. The firms usually charge a management fee of as
            much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
            investments. Bridgepoint raised 4.8 billion euros for its fourth
            pool of capital in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Hire Banks for Debut Islamic Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
            its first foray into Islamic capital markets three years after
            starting a sukuk program that it never used. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five banks including the New York-based lender will manage
            the dollar-denominated offering via JANY Sukuk Co., four people
            with knowledge of the deal said. A benchmark-sized sale may
            follow, they said, asking not to be identified as the plan is
            private. Goldman Sachs in 2011 created a $2 billion program that
            faced criticism from some Islamic advisers for not ensuring debt
            would be traded at par value, as required by Shariah. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is joining a growing number of issuers
            seeking to tap demand among Muslim investors in an industry that
            Ernst Young LLP forecasts will double in the five years
            through 2018 to $3.4 trillion. The U.K. became the first non-Muslim country to issue Islamic bonds in June
            with a sale that
            lured bids for more than 10 times the amount offered. Luxembourg
            and Hong Kong are also planning investor meetings for similar
            offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's so much pent up demand in the sukuk space,'
            Thomas Christie, the Dubai-based head of fixed income at
            Prometheus Capital Finance Ltd., said by phone. 'Given the
            controversy in the past, it would be interesting to see what
            structure they're going to use, how they're going to use the
            funds and how the Islamic community reacts to it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Previous Attempt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The planned security will take the form of Sukuk al Wakala,
            a Shariah-compliant structure in which one party entrusts
            another to act on its behalf. Standard Poor's rated the issue
            A-, the seventh-highest investment grade, the company said in an
            e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender established a sukuk program three years ago
            based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
            plus mark-up transaction, that was approved for listing on the
            Irish Stock Exchange by the Central Bank of Ireland. Murabaha
            certificates can only be bought and sold at par value because
            they represent a future claim on the underlying assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The program, blessed by eight of the world's top Islamic
            scholars, became entangled in a debate on whether it met
            Shariah-compliant guidelines and over lack of clarity on how
            Goldman Sachs planned to use the funds it raised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pent-Up Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will hold investor meetings in the Middle
            East on Sept. 10 and 11 and a so-called Regulation S
            transaction, which exempts overseas offerings from registration
            requirements under the SEC Securities Act of 1933, may follow,
            the people said. A benchmark-sized sale usually raises at least
            $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes would 'probably price tighter' than Goldman
            Sachs' conventional bonds due to the 'pent-up demand in the
            sukuk space,' Christie of Prometheus said. The average yield on
            debt that complies with Muslim tenets dropped 63 basis points
            this year to 2.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since May,
            according to the Deutsche Bank Sukuk Bond Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Islamic lenders will have 70 million customers by 2018, up
            from 38 million last year, according to Ernst Young forecasts.
            Shariah-compliant banking assets will double in that period,
            according to the advisory company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;South Africa, Bangladesh &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Africa last month picked banks for its debut sale of
            Islamic notes, while Bangladesh and the Russian region of
            Tatarstan are planning inaugural sales. In addition to itself,
            Goldman Sachs hired Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, National Bank
            of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd. and NCB Capital to
            manage the offering, the people said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for Islamic bonds is surging helped by ample
            liquidity at banks. Al Hilal Bank PJSC, an Islamic lender owned
            by the Abu Dhabi government, received about $5 billion in bids
            for its $500 million sale of perpetual sukuk in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Clearly, this is a good time and the demand for sukuk is
            still there,' Apostolos Bantis, credit analyst at Commerzbank
            AG in Dubai, said by phone. 'This does actually indicate that
            the asset class of sukuk is expanding and diversifying.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JANY Sukuk will enter a murabaha agreement for 49 percent
            of the issued amount and a wakala agreement for the remaining 51
            percent with J. Aron Co., a Goldman Sachs subsidiary,
            according to SP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sells Largest Structured Note in Six Years Outside U.S.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold its
            largest structured notes outside the U.S. in six years, raising
            115 million euros ($151.5 million) from securities tied to
            swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 15-year notes will initially pay coupons based on the
            rate for 10-year euro constant-maturity swaps, benchmarks that
            measure the cost of exchanging floating rate and fixed interest
            payments through the swaps market, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The sale was the New York-based bank's largest
            outside its home market since it raised 230 million euros in
            August 2007, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
            declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in the securities will receive an additional
            payment from the fourth year onwards based on the difference
            between 10-and two-year swap rates, Bloomberg data show. The
            1.61 percentage-point gap between the two rates is the widest
            since January 2011, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A constant maturity swap is a variation of an interest rate
            swap where the floating interest portion is reset periodically. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman raised $552.8 million from selling 31 structured
            notes outside the U.S. this year, up from $503.4 million in the
            same period last year, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. were among 15 securities firms shortlisted to
            manage the initial public offering of Japan Post Holdings Co. as
            the government embarks on potentially its biggest asset sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (MS) Securities Co., Daiwa
            Securities Group Inc. (8601) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were also among the
            companies that passed the first phase of the selection process,
            the Ministry of Finance said in a statement today. It plans to
            select about 10 firms to manage the IPO, slated for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The candidates will have to find ways to divest the postal,
            banking and insurance giant without disrupting the stock market.
            Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration hasn't said how much
            it expects to raise from the sale, which will help fund
            reconstruction from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The
            offering will probably take place in phases and may exceed 4
            trillion yen ($38 billion) in total, the previous government's
            Postal Reform Minister Mikio Shimoji said in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The other foreign companies that made the cut are Barclays
            Plc, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the

        <headline>Goldman Said in Talks With GIC, Blackstone on Rothesay Stakes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks
            to sell a majority stake in its European insurance business to
            Singapore's GIC Pte and Blackstone (BX) Group LP, according to a
            person with knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, and
            Blackstone, the world's biggest private-equity firm, may each
            buy a stake of about 30 percent in Rothesay Life Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner
            Addy Loudiadis, said
            the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            negotiations are private. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
            Co. may also buy 6 percent, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said last month that it expects to sell a
            majority stake in Rothesay, which has about $9.66 billion in
            assets, in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent
            capital rules. Goldman Sachs sold about 80 percent of Global
            Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in Bermuda, to
            institutions and high-net worth clients this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported earlier today that Goldman
            Sachs was set to sell almost two-thirds of the pensions insurer
            to GIC, Blackstone and Mass. Mutual. Spokesmen for Goldman
            Sachs, Rothesay, GIC and Blackstone declined to comment. A
            spokesman for Mass. Mutual, based in Springfield, Massachusetts,
            couldn't be reached outside of normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mass. Mutual invested 100 million pounds ($156 million) in
            subordinated debt in Rothesay this year. The transaction is some
            way off from being completed, with an announcement unlikely
            before the end of September, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures about 12 billion pounds of insurance
            contracts for companies including IAG SA's British Airways and
            General Motors Co. (GM)'s U.K. division. Firms such as Rothesay
            promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a certain age
            and then use derivatives to try to hedge the risk. The insurer
            typically receives a portion of the pension plan's assets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Earnings to Get Boost From Mobileye Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s third-quarter earnings stand to get a boost from a 2007 investment
            in an automated-driving technology company that's more than doubled since a July initial public offering.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank owned 17.5 percent of Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV (MBLY), mostly through its
            Goldman Sachs Investment Partners hedge fund, before it helped take the firm public in July, according to
            filings related to the IPO. The shares priced at $25, above the initial range of $17 to $19, and rose as
            high as $53.91 today. That advance may lead to a third-quarter gain for New York-based Goldman Sachs of more
            than $200 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While calm markets have
            suppressed Goldman Sachs's trading business, they have been a boon to investments the firm makes with its
            own money. The investing and lending unit earned the most profit of Goldman Sachs's four major business
            segments in the 12 months ended in June, and gains in companies that went public drove better-than-expected
            earnings last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs 'has successfully established a strategy that
            should allow the firm to continue in the principal-investing business in the coming years,' Brad Hintz, a
            Sanford C. Bernstein Co. analyst, said in a July note. 'The wisdom of that strategy is clear,' Hintz said,
            as such gains in the second quarter 'once again provided an unanticipated boost to performance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs invested $100 million in Mobileye in 2007, the first year the company had its
            driver-assistance EyeQ chip and algorithms put in new cars. The firm hasn't said whether it added to that
            investment. Mobileye's image-sensing technology uses a single camera to capture and display a vehicle's
            surroundings, and anticipates potential collisions, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Honda,
            Tesla &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mobileye, whose customers include Honda Motor Co. (7267) and luxury
            electric-carmaker Tesla Motors Inc., has leaped from a $1.5 billion valuation in July 2013 to a market
            capitalization of $10.8 billion today. Its $1 billion IPO on July 31 was the biggest in the U.S. by an
            Israeli company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment shows the potential of Goldman Sachs's strategy of
            serving as adviser and principal with key clients. The bank generated about $18 million from its role as
            lead underwriter of Mobileye's IPO, according to a regulatory filing, and advised the company last year when
            it received investments from firms including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a
            spokesman for the company, declined to comment on the firm's holdings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investing and
            lending unit includes direct investments in debt and equity, stakes in private equity and hedge funds, and
            loans to corporate and individual clients. The unit earned $4.26 billion before taxes in the 12 months ended
            in June, or 37 percent of the firm's total, on $7.14 billion in revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equity Gains
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains from equity investments drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter and in
            the final three months of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in July that two-thirds of the
            $1.25 billion in equity gains for the second quarter came from companies that went public or experienced an
            event that resulted in a new valuation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A $200 million gain would represent about a
            quarter of equity investment revenue for the average of the past 10 quarters. The firm had $18 billion of
            investments in private equity and $4.33 billion in public stock as of June 30. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts
            including Citigroup Inc.'s Keith Horowitz have said that shareholders give Goldman Sachs less credit for
            investing and lending gains because they're seen as volatile and difficult to predict. Schwartz has said the
            activities are 'core competencies' of the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;ELQ Investors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six
            percent of Goldman Sachs's stake in Mobileye before the IPO was held by Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, a
            hedge fund that includes client money and the bank's own capital. The other 14 percent was a principal
            investment held through a subsidiary named ELQ Investors II Ltd. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ELQ sold $36 million of
            its stake in the IPO, leaving it with 1.7 percent of Mobileye's shares. The remaining stake would be worth
            $176 million at the Sept. 5 closing price if ELQ didn't sell more shares after the IPO. GSIP sold $105
            million of Mobileye stock in the IPO, leaving it with 12.3 percent of the company, which would be worth $1.3
            billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third-quarter gain for Goldman Sachs will depend on a number of factors,
            including how Mobileye's stock trades in September and whether ELQ and GSIP maintain their post-IPO stakes.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares gained as much as 7.9 percent today, after General Motors Co. said it would
            introduce a Cadillac model in two years that uses automated-driving technology. Detroit-based GM didn't name
            potential technology suppliers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobileye Valuation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs,
            which marks its investments to the current market price, hasn't disclosed at what price it valued Mobileye
            on June 30. If it marked at $18, the midpoint of the original IPO range, ELQ would currently have a gain of
            $122 million. GSIP would have a $842 million gain, and Goldman Sachs would receive some cut of that as an
            investor in the fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's own money accounted for about 35 percent of the
            $7.5 billion in the fund in October 2009, according to marketing documents at the time. Since then, the
            assets have shrunk and Goldman Sachs has pulled money from hedge funds to eventually comply with the Volcker
            Rule, which sets a 3 percent limit for how much of a fund can be a bank's own capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            fund, which is managed by Kenneth Eberts, Raanan Agus and Nick Advani, had about $5 billion in assets at the
            end of June, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. DuVally declined to say how much of the fund is
            the bank's own money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the unpredictability of
            investing and lending stems from Goldman's need to exit $12 billion of the $14 billion in fund investments
            it had at the end of 2013 to comply with the Volcker Rule, Hintz wrote in June. The bank has said it will
            make those sales at a pace that won't hurt other investors in the funds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains like the
            one from GSIP's stake in Mobileye may provide an incentive for Goldman Sachs to take its time in redeeming
            its capital. Mobileye has jumped more than 35 percent since the start of trading on Aug. 26. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs's own research analyst, Alexander Duval, issued his first recommendation of the stock that day. He
            rated the shares neutral. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Says Buy Global Stocks After ECB's Stimulus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank's decision
            to boost stimulus measures was enough to make Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. change its mind about the short-term fate of the
            global equity market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank raised its three-month rating on stocks to
            overweight, the equivalent of buy, according to a report from
            its portfolio strategy group. Higher bond yields pose less of an
            imminent threat to equities following the ECB's decision last
            week to unexpectedly lower key interest rates and implement an
            asset-buying plan, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The upgrade is a reversal of a call made by Goldman Sachs
            on July 26, when the firm cut its three-month rating on stocks
            to neutral amid expectations that government bond yields would
            increase. The bank maintained its 12-month overweight rating for
            stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees 'lower risk' from bonds following the
            ECB decision, analysts led by chief global equity strategist
            Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a Sept. 5 client note. 'The net
            effect of the policy action from here will be positive for
            equity markets,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI All-Country World Index has rebounded 3.6 percent
            over the last month since falling to an 11-week low on Aug. 7.
            The gauge declined 0.4 percent at 10:39 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global equity measure climbed 0.2 percent last week as
            the ECB reduced its three main interest rates by 10 basis
            points, lowering the benchmark rate to 0.05 percent and the
            deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi
            said the central bank will announce details of an asset-backed
            securities program after its October rate-setting meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.1 percent on the day of
            the Sept. 4 announcement as two-year note yields fell below zero
            in eight countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs isn't alone in getting more bullish on
            equities. Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Adam Parker announced today an increase in the firm's
            12-month SP
            500 forecast to 2,125. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank AG strategist
            David Bianco increased his year-end SP 500 target to 2,050 from
            1,850 and his 2015 projection to 2,150. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MetLife Adds Goldman's D'Agosta in Asset-Management Push</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc. (MET), the largest U.S. life
            insurer, said Nela D'Agosta joined from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            as a managing director in the unit investing funds for
            institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;D'Agosta will focus on marketing and relationships for
            MetLife, the New York-based insurer said in a statement today.
            She was a senior relationship manager at Goldman Sachs's asset
            management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MetLife created the unit for institutional investors last
            year as Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian works to boost
            fee income and scales back from capital-intensive businesses
            like variable annuities. The insurer said last month that it won
            a commitment of as much as $5 billion from SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)
            for commercial mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Nela will bring strong global experience in sales,
            relationship management and team leadership,' Lou Jug, head of
            investor services for MetLife Investment Management, said in the
            statement. 'Her extensive relationship management
            expertise and client service capabilities are valuable assets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier at Goldman Sachs, D'Agosta was global head of
            insurance client relationship management. Andrea Raphael, a
            spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;D'Agosta also worked at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) and graduated from Villanova University in 1990 with a
            bachelor's degree in business administration. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Leads Wall Street Tapping Taiwan Insurer Cashpile</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks including Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are rushing to issue U.S.
            dollar bonds in Taiwan after a rule change unlocked $586 billion
            of funds held by the island's insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman sold $974 million of 30-year notes last month in
            the largest such issuance on the island, leading $7.3 billion in
            greenback debt offers this year, versus zero a year earlier.
            J.P. Morgan Securities LLC estimates U.S. issuers can obtain
            lower costs than they would at home, after lawmakers in May
            excluded locally issued foreign-currency bonds from a 45 percent
            cap on the amount insurance firms can invest in overseas assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taiwanese insurers' yearly premium income has more than
            doubled in the past decade as China's export-manufacturing boom
            boosted the island's wealth. Their hunt for fixed-income
            investments has cut the 10-year sovereign yield 116 basis points
            in the past 10 years to 1.71 percent, the 13th-lowest globally,
            compared with 2.49 percent in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With Taiwan's very low benchmark-rate environment, a lot
            of domestic-currency investments have low yields,' said Godwin Chang, head of Taiwan at Societe Generale AG,
            which sold $1.21
            billion of bonds in the territory this year. 'Life insurers are
            better off having more foreign-currency investments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Negative Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank cut its policy rate to a record low 1.25
            percent in 2009 and maintained it at 1.875 percent in the past
            13 quarters. As domestic rates fell, life insurance firms
            boosted holdings of foreign assets to 44 percent as of June 30
            from 38 percent at the end of 2011, according to the Taiwan
            Insurance Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurance industry's 3.8 percent weighted average
            liability cost was significantly higher than its recurring
            investment yield of 2.8 percent in 2013, according to a June
            presentation by the financial regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman issued its zero-coupon, 30-year bonds at a price to
            yield 4.96 percent last week. Morgan Stanley's notes due 2044
            paid a coupon of 4.7 percent and Citigroup's similar-maturity,
            zero-coupon debt was sold at 4.88 percent. All of the dollar
            notes sold on the island since May's amendment are callable by
            the issuer and mature in 20 or 30 years, while 74 percent pay
            zero coupon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign-currency notes issued in Taiwan are called
            Formosa bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Callable notes are popular among insurers, which can demand
            higher yields to boost returns, J.P. Morgan strategists led by
            Joshua Younger wrote in an Aug. 22 note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because they are considered domestic investments from a
            regulatory perspective, Formosa bonds are generally compared
            against Taiwan dollar-denominated fixed-income products,' the
            strategists wrote. 'With Taiwan dollar rates quite low by
            comparison, yield-sensitive investors are likely to lower their
            return targets for U.S. dollar callable Formosa bonds relative
            to those registered overseas.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bond Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The May 20 amendment also spurred issuances in yuan bonds,
            with lenders such as Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of
            China Ltd. selling 9.3 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of debt in
            Taiwan since then, compared with 1.5 billion yuan in the first
            four months of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Local insurers' total annual premium income grew an average
            8 percent in each of the last 10 years to NT$2.7 trillion ($90
            billion) in 2013 from NT$1.2 trillion in 2003, according to
            Financial Supervisory Commission data. Premiums collected added
            up to 17.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, the
            world's highest penetration rate, a Swiss Re Ltd. report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Insurer Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For insurers whose investments abroad haven't yet neared
            the 45 percent limit, the locally issued foreign-currency bonds
            are not the most attractive. Cathay Life Insurance Co. (2882), the
            largest in the industry with NT$4.3 trillion of assets, has
            bought very few of the foreign-currency notes as they offer
            rates lower than similar securities overseas, executive vice
            president Joseph Wang said at an Aug. 29 briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other companies have been more enthusiastic. Shinkong
            Insurance Co. (2850) has spent NT$42.8 billion on locally issued
            foreign debt and plans to buy more to boost returns, according
            to an Aug. 28 presentation. Fubon Life Insurance Co. aims to
            increase its holdings to NT$100 billion within a year, the
            Economic Daily News reported on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All of the dollar debt sold in Taiwan since May's rule
            change has been bought by the insurance industry, according to
            Mark Liu, Taipei-based head of global markets at Societe
            Generale. The French bank is speaking with European companies
            both in and outside the financial sector regarding bond
            issuances in Taiwan, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Expectations Tempered &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This may be a good time to sell debt as borrowing costs
            will probably rise. Eight of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg poll
            expect Taiwan to raise its policy rate at least once by the end
            of this year. The island's economy is showing signs of a
            recovery this year. Data yesterday showed exports grew 9.6
            percent in August, the most in 20 months. Sixty-six percent of
            Taiwan's shipments went to China, which this week posted a
            record trade surplus for August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., 62 of 74 economists in another survey see a
            Federal Reserve interest-rate increase by the third quarter of
            next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have already tempered their expectations for a
            rate increase, according to Cosmas Lu, chief executive officer
            at the Taipei branch of Barclays Plc, which lists its $600
            million of 30-year bonds on the bond exchange GreTai Securities
            Market today. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have declined 54
            basis points in 2014 as Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled the
            monetary authority's commitment to low borrowing costs amid
            mixed U.S. economic data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Taiwan's investors have been pretty quiet in the first
            half of the year, waiting for interest rates to rise, which
            didn't happen,' Lu said in an Aug. 27 phone interview. 'So
            they're very cash-rich and they realize they can't wait forever.
            There's definitely very big demand from investors.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dow Jones Industrials to Add Goldman Sachs, Nike Shares</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Visa (V) Inc.
            and Nike Inc. (NKE) will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU),
            replacing Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Alcoa
            Inc. (AA) in the biggest reshuffling since April 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes will boost the influence of banking and
            computer companies in the 30-member gauge as the fifth-biggest
            U.S. bank by assets and the largest payment network join seven
            other financial and technology firms, such as JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Cisco Systems Inc. Bank of America exits even after
            rising 109 percent in 2012, the Dow's largest gain. The changes
            will take effect after the close on Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moves announced today by a committee that includes editors
            of the Wall Street Journal will give extra influence to the
            average's newest members, due to the way the gauge is designed.
            Since Dow proportions are determined by stock price rather than
            market value, shares of Visa and Goldman Sachs, which trade
            above $160 apiece, will have about seven times the weighting as
            the constituents they replace. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Dow is going to look and act very differently,' Dan Greenhaus, a strategist at BTIG LLC, said
            in a note to clients.
            'Visa would become the second-most important stock in the index
            and Goldman Sachs the third-most important.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs in $2 Billion Partnership With N.Y. Pension</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;New York state's pension fund is
            giving Goldman Sachs Asset Management $2 billion to invest in
            global stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's the first time the $180.7 billion fund has formed such
            a partnership, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the pension's
            sole trustee, said today in a statement. In addition to
            investing the funds with equity managers, the unit of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will also provide advice across the pension's
            remaining $98 billion equity portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Identifying new opportunities is key to the continued
            growth of the fund's long-term value,' DiNapoli said. It will
            give the pension 'full access to world-class global equity
            investment opportunities and the nimbleness to take advantage of
            them on a timely basis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York joins public pension funds including New Jersey,
            New York City and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas in
            making big allocations of capital to investment managers that
            can be deployed more quickly and across different strategies.
            Such separately managed accounts offer cheaper fees and more
            control for investors, who in turn agree to commit large sums
            for a decade or more. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Landmark' Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Texas committed as much as $3 billion each to KKR
            Co. (KKR) and Apollo Global Management LLC, while New Jersey gave as
            much as $1.5 billion to Blackstone Group LP. New Jersey's State
            Investment Council said the deal would save the state about $120
            million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's partnership with New York state is the
            largest it has ever done, said Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for
            the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2008, the South Carolina Retirement System Investment
            Commission created several strategic partnerships, including one
            with Goldman Sachs. The firm managed $1.15 billion as of June
            30, 2013, according to a report from the state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, New York-based Goldman Sachs received $500 million
            from the Alaska Permanent Fund to manage with a goal of
            returning 5 percentage points more than inflation. The bank had
            $725 million at the end of July, and had returned 8.03 percent
            in the past three years, ahead of its 6.79 percent target,
            according to a report from the Alaskan fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Timothy O'Neill and Eric Lane, global co-heads of the
            investment management division at Goldman Sachs, said the New
            York deal is a 'landmark assignment' for the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are excited to provide customized access to our broad
            open-architecture platform, due diligence expertise and
            portfolio construction capabilities,' they said jointly in the
            e-mailed statement from DiNapoli. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's alternative investments and manager
            selection group, run by Chris Kojima, supervises $156 billion,
            Raphael said. The unit selects and performs due diligence on
            long-only portfolio managers for institutional investors, in
            addition to running funds of funds in private equity and hedge
            funds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Lead $350 Million Buyout of Fund Holdings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s asset-management arm is the lead investor in a transaction to
            purchase stakes in two older distressed-debt funds overseen by a former unit of Carlyle Group LP's TCW Group
            Inc., two people with knowledge of the deal said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management agreed
            to lead a syndicate that will buy stakes from investors in 2002 and 2005 funds run by Crescent Capital Group
            LP, which separated from TCW in 2011, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            information is private. The deal size would be about $350 million, including net asset value and new
            investment capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital, the Los Angeles-based firm headed by co-founders
            Mark Attanasio and Jean-Marc Chapus, hired UBS AG to run the sales process, which would offer its investors
            a way to exit their holdings, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's asset-management arm,
            which oversees $935 billion, is deploying capital in a competitive secondary market where deal volume is
            expected to exceed $30 billion this year as buyers bid up prices to post-crisis highs, according to a July
            report from Dallas-based investment bank Cogent Partners. Goldman Sachs bid 94.8 percent of net asset value
            for stakes in the 2002 fund in August, according to memo on the Fresno County Employees' Retirement
            Association website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman at New York-based Goldman Sachs,
            declined to comment on the deal, as did Bill Mendel, a spokesman for Crescent Capital with Mendel
            Communications and Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for UBS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fresh Capital &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several
            private-equity firms have sought to restructure older funds to gather fresh capital or secure time to sell
            investments in recent years. Chicago-based Lake Capital Partners LP, after deciding against raising another
            buyout fund more than a decade ago, was considering allowing clients to sell their stakes in its 2002 pool,
            two people briefed on the matter said in July. Diamond Castle Holdings LLC, the New York-based firm started
            by executives from Credit Suisse Group AG, and Boston-based J.W. Childs Associates LP have explored similar
            deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital is letting investors exit TCW Shared Opportunity Fund IV, a $250
            million pool nearing the end of its life. Crescent would manage the fund on Goldman's behalf while it sells
            the remaining investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors agreed to extend the term of the fund, originally
            scheduled to expire in December 2010, until the end of this year, according to the Fresno County memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California's Fresno County committed $15 million to the 2002 fund, which was producing a 6.5
            percent net internal rate of return as of June 30, another memo shows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Crescent Capital
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital raised its last distressed-focused fund almost a decade ago. TCW
            Shared Opportunity Fund V, which gathered about $525 million in 2005, has backed Banc of California Inc. and
            First PacTrust Bancorp Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The private-equity firm, which invests in corporate debt
            securities, managed about $15 billion in commitments and capital as of Dec. 31, according to its website.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which oversees $935 billion, invests in fixed income,
            money markets, public equity, commodities, hedge funds, private equity and real estate. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>ViroPharma Said to Hire Goldman Amid Sanofi Interest</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM), a producer of
            drugs that treat rare diseases, has attracted interest from
            suitors including European drugmakers Sanofi (SAN) and Shire Plc (SHP), said
            people with knowledge of the process. ViroPharma's shares
            surged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ViroPharma began working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a
            possible auction after fielding an unsolicited approach, said
            the people, who asked not to be named because talks are private.
            Goldman Sachs has actively sought other suitors for the Exton,
            Pennsylvania-based drugmaker since then, said one person.
            ViroPharma's market value was about $2 billion before
            Bloomberg's report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
            have pursued acquisitions this year as they seek new drugs to
            replace products whose patents are expiring. After Amgen Inc.'s
            agreement to buy Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) for $10.4 billion in
            August, the value of deals in the two sectors has risen 14
            percent from a year earlier to more than $70 billion, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ViroPharma shares gained 28 percent to $39.13 at the close
            in New York, the biggest single-day increase since August 2005.
            Representatives at Sanofi, ViroPharma, Shire and Goldman Sachs
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Scores Coup With Lead Position on Twitter IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), on pace to be the top adviser on U.S. initial public offerings for
            the first time since 2009, scored a coup by landing the lead role on Twitter Inc.'s sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter,
            which announced yesterday that it filed for an IPO, gave Goldman Sachs the job of running the sale, a person
            with knowledge of the matter said. JPMorgan Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley (MS) will also be bankers for the
            IPO, said another person, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Deutsche Bank AG
            also has a part, another person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost out to rival Morgan Stanley on
            similar roles in the highest-profile technology IPOs in recent years, including Facebook Inc. (FB)'s $16
            billion sale last year and offerings by Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. the year before. San Francisco-based
            Twitter may have opted for Goldman Sachs after the other offerings drew criticism and complaints from
            shareholders, according to Michael Holland of Holland Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The Facebook experience was
            one that was so egregious that Twitter did a fairly predictable thing,' said Holland, who oversees more than
            $4 billion as chairman of the New York-based money manager. 'When the biggest and best have needed IPO
            services, Goldman is always a finalist.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
            insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            and George Soros, filed to raise $287.5 million in an initial
            public offering as investors pour capital into companies that
            guaranty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase Co. and Barclays Plc are
            managing the offering, Bermuda-based Essent said today in a
            regulatory filing. The offering size is a placeholder amount used
            to calculate registration fees and may change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgages insurers MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and Radian Group
            Inc., which are recovering from years of losses, have sold stock
            and notes to investors including hedge fund manager John Paulson
            who has been betting on the recovery of the U.S. housing market.
            The guarantors cover losses when homeowners default and
            foreclosures fail to recoup costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering may be used for 'capital
            contributions to support the growth of our insurance
            subsidiaries,' Essent said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Even with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sounding the all-clear, Stephen Jen is
            inclined to stay in the bunker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The co-founder of London-based hedge fund SLJ Macro
            Partners LLC and former chief currency strategist at Morgan Stanley is pushing back against research by
            economists at his one-time employer and Goldman Sachs that the U.S. and global economic expansions have long
            to run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I don't find their argument persuasive at all,' Jen wrote in a Sept. 9 note to
            clients. 'I see the probability of recessions being higher, not lower.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His reasoning is
            that the U.S. and other developed countries still have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis and
            recession that accelerated with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., six years ago yesterday.
            Government debt, for example, has ballooned, leaving economies less secure than in previous expansions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The weak recovery is another reason for Jen to worry. He says it leaves economies prone to small
            shocks that could tip them into another contraction. The euro area stalled in the second quarter, while a
            harsh winter was enough for the U.S. to shrink in the first -- leaving the return to historically normal
            interest rates an unpredictable force. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Easy Money &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley
            said in a Sept. 2 report that a prolonged period of deleveraging in the U.S., alongside global growth, could
            mean the current five-year-old expansion lasts to 2020. It last week extended its analysis to the world
            economy, saying it could grow another five years amid easy money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making a similar
            argument, Kris Dawsey of Goldman Sachs said in a report last month that most economic indicators and asset
            markets suggest the U.S. expansion is not at a late stage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jen says the financial crisis
            changed how economies work, limiting the value of comparisons with past business cycles. He notes Japan had
            six recessions and contracted 37 percent of the quarters since its own asset bubbles burst in 1989-1990.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There are so many features of the macro economy that have been strange and different
            since the global financial crisis of 2008,' said Jen. 'I'm not sure one can be too confident about drawing
            lessons from the pre-crisis period.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>AIG Hires Goldman's May to Boost Image After U.S. Repaid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG),
            the company that repaid a $182.3 billion U.S. bailout last year,
            hired David May from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help revive the
            insurer's brand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;May, 54, was named to the newly created post of chief
            marketing officer and reports to Christina Pretto, senior vice
            president of corporate communications, according to a note she
            sent to colleagues. May's team at AIG includes Mark Clowes, who
            oversees corporate advertising, and Danny Glantz, who handles
            sponsorships, Pretto wrote in the memo, which was obtained by
            Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AIG restored the use of its name in U.S. television ads in
            2011 and struck a deal last year to sponsor six New Zealand
            rugby teams including the All Blacks. The branding revival was a
            reversal for the New York-based insurer, which focused on the
            identities of subsidiaries after then-Chief Executive Officer
            Edward Liddy dismissed the AIG name in 2009 as 'wounded and
            disgraced' by the bailout a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With the financial crisis well behind us, our businesses
            seek to employ best practices and the power of our global scale
            as they leverage the AIG brand,' Pretto wrote. The effort will
            involve 'marketing activities aimed at growing sales, expanding
            distribution channels, and deepening the trust our clients hold
            in us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robert Benmosche, who took over as CEO in 2009, finished
            repaying the rescue in 2012 after selling units to help raise
            funds. This year AIG restored a dividend, the company's first
            since 2008 when the insurer was hobbled by losses on bets tied
            to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gupta, Siewert &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;May worked for 17 years at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
            posts including director of global brand marketing, according to
            the memo. He has an MBA from Harvard University and a bachelor's
            degree from Princeton University, according to AIG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Insurers including Allstate Corp., the largest publicly
            traded provider of U.S. auto coverage, have been recruiting
            marketing executives from outside the industry. Northbrook,
            Illinois-based Allstate last year filled the chief marketing
            officer post with Sanjay Gupta, who had led rebranding at Ally
            Financial Inc.'s bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also worked to burnish its brand after
            fending off accusations that the bank's actions contributed to
            the financial crisis. The company last year hired former U.S.
            Treasury Department aide and presidential spokesman Jake Siewert
            as global head of corporate communications. David Wells, a
            spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn't immediately return a message
            seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AIG climbed 0.6 percent to $50.01 at 1:20 p.m. in New York.
            The insurer has rallied 42 percent this year, beating the 31
            percent advance at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman-to-Soros Backed Mortgage Insurer Essent Files for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
            insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            and George Soros, filed for an initial public offering as
            investors pour capital into companies that guaranty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc are
            managing the share sale, Bermuda-based Essent said yesterday in
            a regulatory filing. The proposed $287.5 million offering size
            is a placeholder amount used to calculate registration fees and
            may change. The prospectus didn't include information about the
            insurer's implied valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers have rallied this year as the U.S.
            residential real estate market rebounds and the government
            weighs scaling back its role in housing finance. MGIC Investment
            Corp. (MTG) and Radian Group Inc. sold stock and notes this year to
            rebuild capital. Losses had mounted at the companies as
            homeowners defaulted during the housing slump, triggering
            payouts on policies sold prior to the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Essent was created 'to serve the U.S. housing finance
            industry at a time when the demands of the financial crisis and
            a rapidly changing business environment created the need for a
            new, privately funded mortgage insurance company,' the firm
            said in the filing. Its mortgage guarantee unit was formed in
            late 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The following year, Essent agreed to pay as much as $30
            million for software and other assets from Triad Guaranty Inc.,
            a mortgage insurer hobbled by losses from soured home loans.
            Competitor PMI Group Inc. ceased writing new coverage and filed
            for bankruptcy in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Essent's Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As those companies stopped writing new business, Essent
            expanded. The firm accounted for 9.2 percent of coverage sales
            in the first six months of this year, up from 5.2 percent a year
            earlier, according to data compiled by Inside Mortgage Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer posted net income of $30.8 million in the six
            months ended June 30, compared with a net loss of $12.5 million
            a year earlier, according to the filing. Premium revenue more
            than tripled from the same period in 2012, as losses and
            expenses were almost unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering may be used for 'capital
            contributions to support the growth of our insurance
            subsidiaries,' according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Essent's investors include New York-based Goldman Sachs and
            Valorina LLC, which is majority owned by an entity that's
            managed by Soros Fund Management LLC, according to the filing.
            The company is planning to list its shares on the New York Stock
            Exchange under the ticker ESNT. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers may benefit as the U.S. retools the
            housing-finance system. President Barack Obama said in a speech
            last month the government should play a smaller role covering
            soured home loans and that private capital should take more risk
            as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are wound down. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Loan Leads Bahrain's Arcapita Out of Chapter 11</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment house that filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S.
            last year, exited bankruptcy after receiving a $350 million loan
            from Goldman Sachs International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the restructuring deal, a new entity
            named RA Holding Corp., owned by the creditors, will realize the
            value of Arcapita's investment portfolio, the bank said in a
            statement on its website. The Goldman Sachs-led loan will fund
            cash flow requirements of the new entity and pay obligations
            connected to the restructuring, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies including Kuwait's Global Investment House KSCC,
            Dubai World Corp. and Dubai-based Nakheel PJSC were forced to
            restructure billions of dollars of debt after lending evaporated
            and asset values plummeted during the global credit crisis.
            Arcapita filed for bankruptcy in March 2012 after negotiations
            with creditors over a $1.1 billion syndicated loan failed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chapter 11 was a challenging experience, but one which
            has enabled us to deliver a solution in the best interests of
            our investors, creditors, and other stakeholders,' Chief
            Executive Officer Atif Abdulmalik said in the statement. 'We
            will be able both to assist RA and investors to maximize the
            value of the existing investment portfolio and to undertake new
            investment opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The existing management team at Arcapita will continue to
            lead the bank's investment portfolio with the aim of maximizing
            sale values. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reorganization is effective from Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Serves Crucial Physical Commodities Role, Blankfein Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s physical
            commodities unit is a 'core' business that provides a crucial
            service to clients, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
            said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The role we play in that business is very, very important
            to users in the market,' Blankfein, 58, said in an interview
            with CNBC. 'Without us in that market, a good credit, a
            regulated company, the outcomes won't be very good for the users
            of the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have questioned whether banks should be
            allowed to own physical commodities businesses and the Federal
            Reserve said it's reviewing a decision it made a decade ago that
            allowed commercial banks to enter the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn't been pressured by regulators to exit
            its physical commodities units, Blankfein said. The New York-based firm is in a different position than some
            commercial banks
            because Goldman Sachs was already in the commodities business
            when it became a bank holding company and didn't need approval
            from regulators later on, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein worked in the firm's J. Aron commodities unit,
            which also produced Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz
            and President Gary D. Cohn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That is a core, strategic business for us,' Blankfein
            said. 'Commodity hedging is no different to people who have
            risks in the commodities markets -- which are real, iconic
            American companies -- as their credit risk or interest-rate
            risk. And we provide that service.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Hatzius Sees 'Significant Impact' From Rate Projection</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve projections for
            where the federal funds rate will be in 2016 are a central piece
            of information being released in conjunction with the policy-maker meeting ending today, said Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. chief
            economist Jan Hatzius. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That is the first time that FOMC participants are going
            to be telling us where they see monetary policy that far out in
            the future,' Hatzius said of the Federal Open Market
            Committee's two-day session on Bloomberg Television's Market
            Makers with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker. 'Our
            expectation is that most of the participants will project
            something in the low two's, but I think there will be a
            significant impact from whatever they do.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fed policy makers will also probably decide today whether
            to taper $85 billion in monthly bond buying at their meeting in
            Washington, dialing down monthly Treasury purchases by $5
            billion to $40 billion while maintaining mortgage-backed
            securities purchases at $40 billion, according to a Bloomberg
            News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'No tapering would definitely be a surprise,' Hatzius
            said. 'Investors are very much on board with the idea that you
            get some tapering.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed will also release its economic forecasts today, and
            Hatzius said 'it is pretty clear that 2013 growth numbers are
            going to have to come down.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Leme Says Brazil Unit Returned to Profitability</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Brazil
            unit returned to profitability in the fourth quarter as the
            departure of several managing directors helped cut costs and
            fixed-income gains offset an investment-banking revenue drop. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We made the right decision in anticipating that this year
            would be less vibrant for investment banking, and had some
            opportunities for cost reductions when some executives left
            after receiving good job offers,' Paulo Leme, named Goldman
            Sachs's president and chief executive officer for Brazil today,
            said in an interview in Sao Paulo. Leme, 59, didn't say how long
            the New York-based company had been losing money in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs eliminated bonuses for some bankers in Brazil
            this year, contributing to the departures of five executives in
            January, people familiar with the matter said in February. The
            company reduced employees in investment banking to 25 from 45,
            the people said. Fabio Bicudo, the former co-head of investment
            banking, left in January to become CEO of Rio de Janeiro-based
            power company Eneva SA, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs began trading Brazil Treasury bonds in the
            second half of last year, 'and now we are the most active bank
            in the primary market and one of the top four in the secondary
            market, competing head-to-head with local players,' Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, whom Leme is replacing, said
            in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vollbrechthausen will move to New York after Leme's
            appointment is approved by Brazil's central bank, to become
            Goldman Sachs's head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities
            sales for Latin America. Leme was previously chairman for
            Brazil, a position that will be eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drag from lower investment-banking revenue is also
            being offset by gains in private equity, structured credit,
            mezzanine financing and non-performing loan acquisitions, said
            Vollbrechthausen, who is a Goldman Sachs partner, a nod to the
            firm's history as a private partnership before going public in
            1999. Leme is a managing director, one level below partner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With about 300 employees in Brazil, about the same as the
            level at the start of last year, the bank is 'well-staffed'
            for now, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
            Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
            the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
            Sachs's revenue from investment banking had been falling in
            Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
            people familiar with the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Treasury Error Said to Block Goldman Sachs From Auction of Bills</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
            prevented from participating in the Sept. 9 auction of three-month U.S. Treasuries because of a malfunction
            with the
            government's online order system, according to a person with
            direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One bidder couldn't participate in the sale of three-month
            bills due to a 'technical error' with the government's TAAPS
            system, the Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt said Sept. 10 on
            its website. Goldman Sachs was the firm that was locked out,
            according to a person briefed on the event, who asked not to be
            identified because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The disruption in the Treasury auction comes as U.S.
            regulators press for improvements in the infrastructure of
            American equity and derivatives markets. Following Nasdaq OMX
            Group Inc.'s three-hour trading halt on Aug. 22, Securities and
            Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White told U.S. stock
            markets on Sept. 12 to collaborate on bolstering technology
            systems. On Sept. 9, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
            requested industry input on safeguarding markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Public Debt 'continues to test its systems
            to maintain the smooth functioning of Treasury auctions,' it
            said on Sept. 10. The government said attempts to address the
            Sept. 9 malfunction 'ultimately resulted' in the bidder buying
            more than 35 percent of the six-month bills that were sold,
            which normally isn't allowed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Becomes Second Biggest Holder in Batista's OSX</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. became the
            second-largest shareholder in Eike Batista's OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) as
            the shipbuilding unit of the former Brazilian billionaire faces
            a possible restructuring of $500 million in bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired OSX shares on Sept. 3 to reach a
            5.22 percent stake, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a
            regulatory filing today. OSX is the worst-performing stock in
            Batista's commodities group this year with a 92 percent slump. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Batista, Brazil's richest person until November, is selling
            assets and restructuring his group of publicly traded
            commodities and logistics startups after a series of missed
            operational and financial targets eroded investor confidence.
            Creditors representing about 60 percent of OSX bondholders hired
            law firm Bingham McCutchen LLP in preparation for the possible
            restructuring of the company's 2015 bonds, two people briefed on
            the arrangements told Bloomberg News on Sept. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
            declined to comment on the share purchase in an e-mail sent by
            an external public relations representative in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a minority investment that does not involve a
            change in the composition of corporate control or a change in
            the management structure of the company,' the firm said in a
            letter accompanying the OSX filing. 'Currently, the shareholder
            does not target any quantity of the company's shares.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OSX fetches 0.06 times book value, making it the cheapest
            stock among 264 companies trading in Brazil with a market value
            of at least $100 million, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The entrepreneur created OSX to supply vessels to
            sister company OGX Petroleo Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3), which is in
            talks with creditors in a bid to avoid bankruptcy protection. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OSX rose 1.3 percent to 80 centavos in Sao Paulo today, the
            highest since Sept. 9. This year's slump is the steepest in the
            Ibovespa small cap index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Start Hedge Fund for Asia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Investment Partners,
            set up to allow clients to invest with some of the bank's top
            proprietary traders, is raising capital for a new Asian fund,
            said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund, named Oryza Capital, started early this month,
            said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            information is private. It is overseen by a team led by Hideki Kinuhata in Tokyo and Hong Kong-based Ryan
            Thall, said the
            people, who didn't disclose how much money the fund is seeking
            to gather. Kinuhata and Thall didn't reply to e-mails seeking
            comment on the new fund. Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based
            spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asia's economic growth that has outperformed the U.S. and
            Europe, and renewed interest in Japan, where Prime Minister
            Shinzo Abe has committed to ending deflation, are attracting
            global investors. Inflows into Asia-focused funds took regional
            hedge-fund assets to $98.4 billion as of the end of June, the
            highest since 2007, according to Chicago-based data provider
            Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Asia is still one of the fastest-growing regions in the
            world, albeit at a slower pace, so it's no surprise that there
            is continued interest in notable Asian launches,' Will Tan, a
            managing director who focuses on the hedge-fund industry at
            Singapore-based recruiting firm Principle Partners Pte, said.
            'The past year especially has seen renewed global interest in
            Japan resulting in a surge in hiring for Japan-focused
            investment professionals.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hedge Funds Keen on China Exchange Link, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds may drive initial
            demand for Shanghai-listed stocks through a linkage of the
            city's bourse with that in Hong Kong, which opens up a new route
            for foreign investors to buy Chinese shares, according to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The link will tap into pent-up demand from hedge funds to
            buy yuan-denominated class-A shares traded in Shanghai, said
            Shane Bolton, head of Asia prime brokerage at the New York-based
            bank. Long-only managers may grapple with pre-trade requirements
            that are different from their usual practice at the beginning,
            he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign investors so far can only buy yuan shares listed in
            Asia's second-largest stock market through the qualified foreign
            institutional investors, or QFII, and the renminbi QFII
            programs. The link, set to start next month, will allow
            investors, with or without their own QFII licenses, to buy as
            much as 13 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) of Shanghai-traded yuan
            stocks a day, according to a Sept. 4 statement posted on the
            Hong Kong stock exchange's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Stock connect will be a game changer for most hedge
            funds, allowing them to access A shares for the first time
            without having to use banks' QFII quota,' Bolton said in an
            interview in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Estimates Cut by Atlantic</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks' fixed-income trading revenue will probably fall 20 percent in the
            third quarter from a year ago on lower volumes, according to
            Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staite cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s per-share earnings 18 percent to $2.47
            and Morgan Stanley's 25
            percent to 38 cents, according to a research note today. Staite
            also cut his estimate at Citigroup Inc. (C) by 14 percent to $1.05. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, and Barclays
            Plc have told investors that third-quarter trading revenue will
            probably drop from a year earlier. Jefferies Group LLC said last
            week that revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent
            in its fiscal third quarter that ended Aug. 31 compared with the
            same period in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'July and August were very slow months as investors sat on
            the sidelines waiting for more clarity on Fed tapering, Syria
            and the emerging-market slowdown, and we believe the weakness
            has extended into September,' Staite wrote in a note, referring
            to uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would slow its $85
            billion-a-month bond-buying program. 'In contrast September
            2012 was very active in rates and foreign exchange due to
            improvements in the Eurozone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage production revenue at the biggest banks will
            probably be down 55 percent, Staite added. That's because the
            third quarter in 2012 was 'a strong period for both volumes and
            margins,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1,800 Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, said
            last week that it's cutting about 1,800 jobs in its home-loan
            production business as rising interest rates curb demand for
            refinancing. Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan said Sept. 9
            that the San Francisco-based bank may originate about $80
            billion in home loans during the third quarter, a 29 percent
            decline from the three months that ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staite previously cut his estimates for JPMorgan by 14
            percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) by 10 percent following their
            comments at a conference, he wrote. Wells Fargo's estimates were
            held flat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think Bank of America will show better underlying cost
            and revenue trends than its major peers,' Staite said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Atlantic Equities has an 'underweight' recommendation on
            Morgan Stanley (MS), U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo, a 'neutral'
            rating on Goldman Sachs, and an 'overweight' recommendation on
            Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and PNC Financial Services
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said in Talks for Stake in Brazil Toll Collector</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private-equity fund and General Atlantic LLC are in talks to buy a 12.75
            percent stake in STP -- Servicos Tecnologia de Pagamentos SA,
            the Brazilian electronic-toll-collection company, two people
            with direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toll-road operator EcoRodovias Infraestrutura Logistica
            SA hired Banco Itau BBA SA to sell its stake in Osasco-based STP
            for about 250 million reais ($114 million), the people said,
            asking not to be identified because the negotiations are
            private. The talks, which include additional potential buyers,
            are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of vehicles traveling Brazil's toll roads rose
            4.2 percent in the past 12 months, according to Brazil's
            Association of Highway Concessionaires. STP sells Sem Parar and
            Via Facil tags, which car owners use to pay tolls and parking
            fees. CCR SA (CCRO3), the biggest toll operator by revenue, and CCBR
            Catel Construcoes do Brasil Ltda are STP's biggest shareholders,
            with a combined 73.25 percent, according to data on STP's
            website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;STP said last month it agreed to sell a 10 percent stake to
            Raizen Energia SA, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc
            and Cosan SA Industria Comercio, for 250 million reais, in a
            capital increase that will dilute holdings of most existing
            shareholders when completed. Highway-concession company Arteris
            SA will retain its 4.68 percent stake after the deal, which must
            still to be approved by Brazil's antitrust regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FleetCor Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FleetCor Technologies Inc., a Norcross, Georgia-based
            provider of fuel cards and workforce payment products to
            businesses, said on Sept. 10 it agreed to acquire DB Trans SA, a
            provider of payment solutions for independent truckers in Brazil
            and also an electronic-toll-collection company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;STP, EcoRodovias and Itau declined to comment, according to
            officials who asked not to be named in keeping with company
            policies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to
            comment in a e-mailed statement. Pat Hedley, a spokeswoman for
            General Atlantic, said the company's policy is not to comment on
            investments it may be considering. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Expand Electronic Bond-Trading Sessions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has added
            trading sessions and increased the money it makes available to
            buy securities on its electronic bond-trading platform as the
            industry grapples with changes in market structure, according to
            a person briefed on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will hold two daily sessions on its platform,
            up from twice weekly when it started last year, and will offer
            $300 million in guaranteed liquidity, said the person, who asked
            not to be identified because the change hadn't been publicly
            announced. The platform, known as GSessions, was halted last
            month amid a lack of demand, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bond dealers and investors have started
            electronic-trading platforms as they seek to reduce costs and
            improve their ability to convert investments into cash amid new
            capital rules. The world's biggest dealers have cut inventories
            of corporate debt by three-quarters since the 2007 peak, leading
            to concerns that waning liquidity provides greater potential for
            market disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While clients have been wary of trading on so-called
            single-dealer platforms run by one bank, the sell-side hasn't
            agreed on parameters that would allow one multidealer platform
            to emerge, according to two people involved in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs began trading on GSessions in June 2012,
            after a year of development. The expansion will allow clients to
            trade 35 bonds -- including investment-grade and high-yield
            securities -- each day, the person said. GSessions is housed
            within the New York-based bank's credit-trading unit and remains
            a small part of that group's revenue, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Technology Shifts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
            comment. The Financial Times reported the changes to Goldman
            Sachs's system yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The corporate bond market is unsuitable for full electronic
            trading, according to a study last month by McKinsey Co. and
            Greenwich Associates. The bond market has more securities
            compared with listed stocks and its issues trade at a lower
            frequency, making a full transition to computer-based buying and
            selling unlikely, the consultants said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, set up
            an internal electronic bond-trading system that would match
            orders from buy-side investors, allowing them to bypass Wall
            Street dealers. The system failed in April because it couldn't
            attract a critical mass of customers, even as small dealers
            stood ready to aid trading. The New York-based firm said in
            April it would instead route trades through MarketAxess Holding
            Inc.'s electronic system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) revamped its electronic brokering system,
            called Bond Pool, last year, offering sessions based on client
            interest. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. announced
            plans to start electronic bond-trading platforms this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While technology and shifts in market structure have added
            to the appearance of fixed-income market liquidity, they have
            added little depth, according to a July report by the Treasury
            Borrowing Advisory Committee. Trading volumes of investment-grade debt dropped in August to the lowest since
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Parikh, 35, is resigning to trade currencies at an investment firm, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the move isn't public. Parikh, who worked in London, didn't respond to a message
            left with a colleague or to e-mails to his work address. He joined Goldman Sachs in July 2002, according to
            his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His departure marks the continued exodus of traders from banks amid cost cutting and increased
            regulation that prevents proprietary trading and limits the capital trading desks may put at risk. The
            number of bankers doing business in the Group of 10 currencies shrank to 2,278 in the first half of this
            year from 2,929 in the same period of 2010, according to London-based consulting firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are also probing the $5.3 trillion-a-day market over allegations dealers leaked
            confidential client information and colluded to rig benchmarks. The scandal may cost lenders as much as $15
            billion in fines, according to Chirantan Barua, a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Parikh's
            move is unrelated to any investigations, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Talented Individuals' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's no surprise to see talented individuals looking to move to a less constrained environment,'
            said John Purcell, chief executive officer of London-based executive-search firm Purcell Co. 'In the
            political heat generated during the recent downturn, regulators became over zealous trying to out do each
            other with their 'bash the banks, tough-guy approach.'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Citigroup's
            Jeffrey Feig and Deutsche Bank AG's Christopher Fahy were hired by Fortress Investment Group LLC, the first
            publicly traded private-equity and hedge-fund manager in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rohan Ramchandani,
            Citigroup's former European head of foreign-exchange spot trading, began at an online-trading firm earlier
            this month. Darren Coote, global head of spot foreign exchange at Lloyds Banking Group Plc, resigned for
            personal reasons in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank's global head of foreign exchange, Kevin
            Rodgers, left in June after 15 years to join the performing arts. He recently sang the parts of four
            villains in Jacques Offenbach's 'Tales of Hoffmann' and is set to appear in the Gilbert and Sullivan
            operetta 'The Mikado' in London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
            Chase Co. and billionaire George Soros are poised for gains
            from a housing bet placed in the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), the Bermuda-based mortgage insurer that
            raised $500 million from a group including those backers in
            2009, filed last week to sell shares in the first initial public
            offering of a home-loan guarantor in almost two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The industry is rebounding from record homeowner defaults
            that triggered payouts, forced almost half the companies out of
            the business and pushed some of the biggest survivors to the
            brink of default. With property prices now rising at the fastest
            pace since 2006 and the government reducing its role backing
            home loans, firms that sold policies before housing collapsed --
            Radian Group Inc. and MGIC (MTG) Investment Corp. -- are attracting
            new investors to replace capital lost in the slump. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We still think it's the best way to play the housing
            recovery,' Jack Micenko, an analyst at Susquehanna
            International Group LLP in New York, said of mortgage insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Radian and MGIC, which were unprofitable for most of the
            past six years, have more than doubled in 2013 in New York
            trading. Homebuilders in comparison are down 0.6 percent this
            year after slumping 20 percent since a May peak. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Bank of America Fund Context Relevant</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant Inc., a maker of
            software that analyzes data and makes predictions, raised $13.5
            million from a group of investors including Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Corp. to fund expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each bank will get a seat on the Seattle-based company's
            board, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Purpura, who founded
            the company in 2012. The banks will also use Context Relevant's
            technology, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant also raised funds from New York Life
            Insurance Co. and existing venture investors Formation 8 and
            Bloomberg Beta. The company raised $21 million three months ago,
            and total funding to date is $42 million. Bloomberg Beta is a
            unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We raised another round because we are growing
            exponentially and achieved all the goals set by the previous
            round,' Purpura said in an interview. He declined to comment on
            the company's valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant's technology can be used to predict
            external and internal threats such as hacking, data theft and
            insider trading, and the company generates revenue from annual
            software licenses. The software developer is seeking to boost
            the number of employees to 200 from the current 50, and needs to
            hire analysts, sales staff and customer-service representatives,
            Purpura said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant also said it hired Richard Clarke, former
            U.S. National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism, as
            acting head of its security products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Data, Security &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the wake of recent breaches at banks, exchanges, hedge
            funds, payment processors and retailers, it is clear that there
            is a market for Context Relevant to deliver automated
            intelligent systems to help address these challenges,' Clarke,
            who was already advising Context Relevant, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. and at least other four banks were
            attacked last month by Russian hackers who stole gygabites of
            customers' data people familiar with the investigation have
            said. Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Target Corp. (TGT) have also been the target
            of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other startups such as Palantir Technologies Inc., a
            software maker co-founded by Formation 8 partner Joe Lonsdale,
            and DataRobot Inc. also develop predictive software that can
            analyze data and detect potential threats. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Aabar Said to Work With Goldman Sachs on Options for RHB Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Aabar Investments PJSC, owned by
            Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, is working with Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) as it explores options for its stake in RHB Capital
            Bhd. (RHBC), according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aabar, the Malaysian bank's second-largest shareholder with
            a 21.2 percent stake, is seeking to protect the value of its
            investment as the lender negotiates a three-way, $27 billion
            merger with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) and Malaysia Building
            Society Bhd., the people said. It hasn't yet signed a formal
            mandate with Goldman Sachs, one person said, asking not to be
            identified as the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIMB, Malaysia's second-biggest bank, and RHB are
            discussing structuring the deal as a reverse takeover, people
            familiar with the matter said this month. The structure of the
            transaction, which would value RHB at about 1.4 times book
            value, is designed to overcome any potential resistance from
            Aabar as it would require approval from only a majority of RHB
            investors, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment. Aabar officials didn't respond to
            several e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aabar bought its RHB stake from Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
            PJSC for 10.80 ringgit per share in 2011, when RHB was the
            target of a takeover battle between the country's biggest lender
            Malayan Banking Bhd. and CIMB. RHB shares traded at 8.86 ringgit
            at 3:07 p.m. today in Kuala Lumpur, 18 percent below Aabar's
            purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EPF's Vote &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIMB, RHB and Malaysia Building Society (MBS) in July announced
            plans for a three-way merger that would create the country's
            largest banking group by assets. The companies, which have a
            combined market value of about $27 billion, entered into a 90-day exclusive agreement to negotiate and
            finalize the price and
            structure of the merger, according to a July 10 joint statement
            from the lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under a proposal being discussed, RHB would issue new
            shares to acquire CIMB, whose market value is two and a half
            times bigger, people familiar with the talks said earlier this
            month. An outright acquisition by CIMB would require approval
            from 75 percent of RHB shareholders, leaving Aabar in a stronger
            position to scuttle the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even so, engaging with Aabar may become more important amid
            uncertainty about whether Malaysian pension manager Employees
            Provident Fund, which owns stakes in all three banks, will be
            allowed by the country's stock exchange to vote on the deal. EPF
            controls 40.9 percent of RHB. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EPF wrote to the three lenders on Aug. 26, saying it should
            be given a waiver allowing the fund to vote on the proposed
            merger, Malaysian newspaper The Star reported Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIMB and RHB are discussing making the merger proposal
            conditional on EPF being allowed to vote, three people familiar
            with the talks said. The exclusivity period for the merger talks
            expires Oct. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Global Atlantic Buys Forethought for Post-Goldman Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic Financial Group,
            the insurer divested by Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. this year,
            agreed to buy closely held Forethought Financial Group Inc. to
            expand sales of life and retirement products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase will increase assets at Global Atlantic to
            more than $31 billion, the Bermuda-based insurer said today in a
            statement that didn't include terms. Forethought had $6.3
            billion in assets as of Dec. 31, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic, led by Chief Executive Officer Allan Levine, is expanding distribution after
            Goldman Sachs sold a
            majority stake in the firm to private investors. The insurer
            announced in May that it would buy Aviva Plc's U.S. life
            business, with $10 billion of assets, in a reinsurance deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Forethought's leading annuity distribution and pre-need
            business will further diversify our product mix and position us
            to provide a full range of innovative life and annuity
            solutions,' Levine said in today's statement. Pre-need policies
            provide funds that can pay funeral costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic was founded in 2004 at Goldman Sachs and
            acquired Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Co. in 2005.
            The firm also offers reinsurance under the Ariel Re brand.
            Global Atlantic had $1.75 billion in equity, the company said in
            a May 1 statement announcing the separation from New York-based
            Goldman Sachs, which maintained a stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forethought's surplus, a measure of assets minus
            liabilities, was about $470 million as of Dec. 31. The Houston-based company agreed in 2012 to acquire an
            individual annuities
            distribution unit from Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.,
            and entered the variable annuity market this year, according to
            Forethought's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Caskets, Funerals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hillenbrand Industries Inc., a maker of caskets, agreed to
            sell Forethought to Devlin Group LLC in 2004 for about $280
            million, according to a statement at the time. Hillenbrand
            started Forethought to sell coverage that paid for funerals when
            policyholders died. Mark Kollar, a spokesman for Global Atlantic
            at Prosek Partners and David Entrekin at Forethought declined to
            comment on terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic's transaction is expected to be completed
            in early 2014, according to the statement. Debevoise Plimpton
            LLP provided legal advice to Forethought, the law firm said in
            an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said capital requirements by international
            banking regulators pushed the retreat from insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Alfa Said to Hire Citigroup, Goldman for Sigma Food Unit IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA), the Mexican maker of car
            parts and petrochemicals, hired Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. for an initial public offering of its Sigma Alimentos
            SA food division, according to two people with direct knowledge
            of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB also
            are among the banks working on the transaction, said the people,
            who asked not to be identified because details of the planned
            sale, including the timing and size, haven't been set. Alfa fell
            0.5 percent to 36.67 pesos at the close in Mexico City, after
            earlier advancing as much as 3.7 percent. The benchmark IPC
            index of 35 companies fell 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sigma's IPO would be the second in two years from San Pedro
            Garza Garcia-based Alfa, which sold shares of petrochemical
            division Alpek SAB in April 2012. Sigma has been expanding
            through acquisitions, with purchases in the second quarter of a
            Costa Rican cheesemaker and a Mexican processor of beef, poultry
            and pork. In 2010 Sigma bought Phoenix-based Bar-S Foods Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enrique Flores, a spokesman for San Pedro Garza Garcia,
            Mexico-based Alfa, didn't respond to e-mails and phone calls
            seeking comment on the company's plans for Sigma. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Angeles Meraz, a press official with Citigroup's Banamex
            unit, declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a Goldman
            Sachs spokesman, and Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for Bank of
            America. Ayax Carranza, a press official with Banorte, didn't
            respond to phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alfa shares have soared 35 percent this year, the fourth-best performance on the nation's benchmark
            IPC index, giving the
            company a market value of 189.4 billion pesos ($14.5 billion) at
            yesterday's close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sigma accounted for about a quarter of Alfa's 2012 earnings
            before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure
            of profit known as Ebitda. It contributed about 23 percent of
            sales. &lt;/p&gt;

            estimate by 15 percent to $2.62 and the full-year estimate by
            8.6 percent to $15.59 per share, according to a note today about
            the two New York-based banks. Morgan Stanley's per-share third-quarter estimate was decreased 20 percent to
            41 cents, and the
            2013 figure dropped 4.8 percent to $1.98. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While the third quarter is typically seasonally soft, Q3
            2013 appears to be turning into a full-scale rout in trading as
            weak activity and limited risk-taking constrained performance,'
            Hintz wrote. Fixed-income trading volume could decline 20
            percent to 25 percent on average in the three months ended Sept.
            30, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts have been reducing their third-quarter earnings
            estimates for the biggest U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase Co., the
            nation's largest lender, said trading revenue will probably fall
            this period and Jefferies Group LLC said revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent in its fiscal
            third quarter,
            which ended Aug. 31, compared with a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marty Mosby, an analyst for Guggenheim Securities LLC,
            downgraded shares of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Corp.,
            the second-biggest U.S. bank, to neutral from buy as revenue
            from capital-markets and mortgage banking declines, according to
            a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading revenue at the biggest U.S. banks will
            probably fall 20 percent in the third quarter from a year
            earlier amid lower volume, Richard Staite, an analyst at
            Atlantic Equities LLP, said in a note this week. That led him to
            cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs's per-share third-quarter
            earnings by 18 percent and Morgan Stanley's by 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Be Among Buyers of $1.5 Billion Dong Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is part of
            a group that's close to buying a stake in Dong Energy A/S,
            Denmark's largest utility, a person involved in the transaction
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group, which includes a unit of New York-based Goldman
            and Danish pension funds ATP and PFA, will pay more than 8
            billion kroner ($1.5 billion) for a stake that's greater than 20
            percent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
            the talks are private. Danish newspaper Borsen reported earlier
            today that Goldman and the two funds are seeking a stake,
            without saying how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denmark's government said in February it will sell a stake
            in the Skaerbaek, Denmark-based utility which is restructuring
            after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Goldman would be
            the lead buyer taking a greater stake than the pension funds,
            the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman wouldn't say if the bank is seeking to buy a stake
            in Dong, according to an e-mail from Joanna Carss, a London-based spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parties are still negotiating terms for how they would
            exit the investment, the person said. The buyers want a clause
            allowing them to sell their stake to the government or a
            timetable for an initial public offering of Dong shares, the
            person said. &lt;/p&gt;

            Dong is selling shares as part of a financial restructuring announced in February to cut costs, reduce debt
            and bolster investments in oil and gas exploration as well as offshore wind farms. Close

        <headline>Buffett Poised to Get $2 Billion Goldman Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
            Inc. (BRK/A) will get more than $2 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            stock through warrants acquired during the depths of the 2008
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Berkshire will receive about 13.1 million shares in Goldman
            Sachs, according to an agreement that uses the average closing
            price on the 10 trading days through today to calculate
            Buffett's stake. The bank fell 1 percent to $158.21 at 4:15 p.m.
            in New York, valuing the holding at $2.07 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs turned to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in
            2008 to bolster capital and shore up market confidence when
            shares plunged following the collapse of Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc. Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive
            officer, invested $5 billion for a preferred holding and got
            warrants to buy $5 billion of stock for $115 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Buffett used his position as a white knight and his
            reputation to prop up an institution at a time of crisis,' said
            Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook Bynum Capital Management LLC.
            'Goldman Sachs is almost certainly better off for it, even
            though it was very expensive. And certainly Berkshire
            shareholders are better off.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, redeemed the
            preferred stake in 2011 at a 10 percent premium. Buffett agreed
            in March to exercise the warrants through a cashless
            transaction, in which he passed on a chance to spend $5 billion
            for stock at below-market prices. He instead gets an amount of
            stock equivalent to his paper profit, based on closing prices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Citigroup Reviewing Trading Rules After Goldman Move</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. will review its conflict-of-interest policy for investment bankers after Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. barred some employees from owning individual securities, said a person with direct
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Executives at Citigroup still regard its less-restrictive
            policy as strong enough to prevent conflicts, according to the person, who asked for anonymity because the
            review isn't public. The New York-based bank also may consider how the rest of the industry reacts to
            Goldman Sachs's decision before taking action, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which
            previously required bankers to get approval before they could trade individual securities, told employees
            about the change on Sept. 26, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said at the time. Banks monitor
            staff investments to prevent insider trading and to counter claims that they put the interests of employees
            ahead of clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's six years after the crisis and they are still facing continued
            litigation, so if you were in that foxhole wouldn't you do something?' said Roy Smith, a finance professor
            at New York University's Stern School of Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. 'You protect yourself
            by causing these restrictions.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs changed its policy on the day that public
            radio and ProPublica reported the story of a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York examiner who secretly
            recorded her ex-colleagues' dealings with the New York-based bank. The examiner, Carmen Segarra, sued the
            New York Fed last year, alleging she was fired in 2012 because she refused to change her finding that
            Goldman Sachs didn't have a conflict-of-interest policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup's current rules, amended in June, include a list of stocks that employees are forbidden
            from trading, according to Robert Julavits, a bank spokesman. Staff must seek approval from managers and the
            compliance unit to trade other stocks and bonds, and bankers are restricted from investing in securities or
            funds from the industries they cover, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup also requires managing
            directors and directors to disclose stakes they hold in companies that hire the bank, Julavits said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are always looking at ways to enhance our policies and procedures,' he said in an e-mailed
            statement. He declined to comment on the bank's plans to review its policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen
            for JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp., the two largest U.S. banks, declined to comment, as did a
            representative of Morgan Stanley, owner of the world's biggest brokerage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Restricting
            Transactions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. 'has long-standing policies and monitoring controls in
            place that require team members to obtain pre-approval for personal securities transactions' and may
            restrict trades if the company believes there could be a conflict, Elise Wilkinson, a bank spokeswoman, said
            in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2012, a Delaware judge rebuked Goldman Sachs over its
            'incomplete and inadequate' handling of a conflict of interest in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc.'s
            $21.1 billion purchase of El Paso Corp., the investment bank's biggest takeover assignment the previous
            year. Stephen D. Daniel, a former Goldman Sachs partner who was lead banker on the deal, failed to disclose
            ownership of about $340,000 in Kinder Morgan stock, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Sued With Goldman in Aluminum Antitrust Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, was sued with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Glencore
            Xstrata Plc (GLEN) over claims they restrained aluminum supplies and
            drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed by a Jacksonville, Florida, direct
            purchaser, Master Screens Inc., and by individual plaintiff
            Daniel Price Bart of Tallahassee, who is described in the filing
            as a 'purchaser of beverages sold in aluminum cans.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks and Glencore are accused in the complaint filed
            yesterday in federal court in Tallahassee of racketeering and
            conspiring with the London Metal Exchange, hoarding aluminum in
            Detroit-area warehouses and violating federal antitrust laws.
            Goldman Sachs was first sued over similar claims by a Michigan
            company on Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By inserting itself into a healthy industry producing
            widely needed commodities, severely degrading functionality and
            widely distributing costs while itself benefiting, Goldman Sachs
            and JPMorgan couldn't fit a more archetypal description of a
            parasite on the markets,' according to the Florida complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are no queues at our warehouses and we believe this
            suit has no merit,' Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe this suit is without merit and we intend to
            vigorously contest it,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New
            York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail. 'We also note that
            aluminum prices are down 40 percent from their peak in 2006.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Warehousing 'Giant' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 1 million tons of aluminum are stored in the
            Detroit warehouses, many of which are owned by Goldman Sachs,
            which charges rent for the storage, according to the complaint,
            while London Metal Exchange load-out rules curtail how much of
            the metal leaves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan-owned Henry Bath Son Ltd., acquired in 2010, is
            described in the complaint as a 'metal warehousing giant.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Florida plaintiffs are seeking class action, or group,
            status, to represent other aluminum buyers and consumers, as
            well as compensatory damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
            commodities group Glencore, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DuVally last week said the complaint filed against Goldman
            Sachs in Detroit was without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A third lawsuit, naming as defendants Goldman Sachs and its
            warehouse unit, Metro International Trade Services LLC, as
            defendants, was filed yesterday in federal court in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaintiff River Parish Contractors Inc. of Reserve,
            Louisiana, also alleges the Goldman Sachs entities inflated
            aluminum prices and restrained supplies in violation of U.S.
            antitrust laws. Neither London Metal Exchange nor JPMorgan are
            named as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Florida case is Master Screens Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., 13-cv-00431, U.S. District Court, Northern District
            of Florida (Tallahassee). The Michigan case is Superior
            Extrusion Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 13-cv-13315, U.S.
            District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). The
            Louisiana case is River Parish Contractors Inc. v. Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., 13-cv-05267, U.S. District Court, Eastern District

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the world's biggest trading firms, had their
            revised capital plans for 2013 cleared by the Federal Reserve
            yesterday, a month before next year's submissions are required. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Fed didn't object to the banks' proposals in
            March, the New York-based firms were required to resubmit them
            after weaknesses were found in projections of revenue and
            potential losses, a Fed official said at the time. The
            submissions from all 18 banks in this year's Comprehensive
            Capital Analysis Review, or CCAR, are now approved ahead of
            the next round due the first week of January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators, intent on preventing a repeat of the 2008
            credit crisis, run annual stress tests to see how the largest
            lenders would fare in a recession or economic shock. Banks need
            Fed approval to raise dividends and increase share buybacks.
            Yesterday's announcement is a welcome development for JPMorgan,
            the subject of more than a half dozen U.S. probes, said Marty Mosby, a bank analyst with Guggenheim
            Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Though this is more of a procedural holdover from the
            2013 CCAR, it just reassures JPMorgan investors that while there
            were significant overhang issues, and still are to a degree,
            there is still a base of capital and risk management that
            regulators generally believe is more than adequate,' Mosby
            said. 'That makes this a little more newsworthy than it
            would've been otherwise.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSGEPPA) hired Neill Nuttall from JPMorgan Asset Management to join
            its multi asset investment strategy team. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuttall was appointed co-chief investment
            officer of Goldman's Global Portfolio Solutions Group and chairman of the GPS investment committee. He
            joined the firm in June and is based in London, said a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirming his
            appointment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuttall left JPMorgan in April after 30 years at the firm, where he most
            recently headed the Global Multi Asset Group, or GMAG, which oversees about $153 billion. JPMorgan last
            month appointed John Bilton from Bank of America Corp. to head the global strategy team, a role Nuttall also
            previously covered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are delighted to have further strengthened our investment team
            with the recent appointment of Neill,' Andrew Wilson, Goldman Sachs Asset Management's CEO for Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, said by e-mail. 'With over 30 years of investment experience, Neill will serve as
            the head of all of our investment activities, overseeing strategic and tactical allocation' for the GPS
            Group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Firms including Invesco Perpetual and Aviva Investors have sought to capitalize
            on the growing demand for multi asset investing, where money is deployed across asset classes from equities
            to infrastructure. Two-thirds of money managers expect multi-asset investment strategies will be the biggest
            contributor to growth in the next three years, according to a State Street Corp. survey last month. &lt;/p&gt;

            of foreign-exchange trading at Goldman Sachs. He declined to
            comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
            investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
            industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
            bank's currency business had 'difficulty managing inventory'
            in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
            trading revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost at least two partners from its currency-trading business this year. Leland Lim,
            co-head of macro trading
            for Asia ex-Japan, left to start a hedge fund. Steven Cho,
            global head of spot and forward trading of G-10 currencies in
            New York, also departed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least a dozen regulators are investigating allegations
            first reported by Bloomberg News in June that traders colluded
            to rig benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market.
            That is boosting demand from clients for greater transparency in
            pricing and transaction charges, accelerating a longer-term
            shift in trading onto electronic platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Electronic Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Electronic dealing, which accounted for 66 percent of all
            currency transactions in 2013 and 20 percent in 2001, will
            increase to 76 percent within five years, according to Aite
            Group LLC, a Boston-based consulting firm that reviewed Bank for
            International Settlements data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mirza had served as JPMorgan's head of foreign-exchange
            trading in Europe, Middle East and Africa and global head of FX
            options trading. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Hire JPMorgan's Strain for Real Estate Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired
            Jonathan Strain as a managing director in its commercial-mortgage bond business, according to two people
            familiar with
            the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strain, previously at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), will be co-head
            of the U.S. real estate finance group alongside Ted Borter, said
            one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            move hasn't been announced. He will be based at the lender's New
            York headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is bolstering the team that underwrites bond
            deals linked to everything from skyscrapers to strip malls as
            Wall Street banks vie for the most lucrative lending assignments
            amid growing competition. The number of firms originating
            property loans to be packaged into securities has almost tripled
            to 27 since issuance revived in 2010 following the financial
            crisis, according to Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strain, who started at JPMorgan in 2007, is joining Goldman
            Sachs after the departure earlier this year of Dan Bennett, who
            held a similar position. Justin Perras, a spokesman for
            JPMorgan, and Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
            they couldn't comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of commercial-mortgage backed securities is
            falling short of predictions of a banner year, pushing
            underwriters to be more aggressive to meet their origination
            goals. Banks have arranged about $25 billion of CMBS this year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg, on track to disappoint
            Wall Street forecasts for as much as $100 billion in 2014
            issuance after sales doubled to $80 billion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the fourth-ranked underwriter of U.S.
            CMBS last year, according to industry newsletter Commercial
            Mortgage Alert. JPMorgan was second, behind top-ranked Deutsche
            Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Sued by Zinc Buyer Over Warehousing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), Glencore PLC (GLEN) and the London Metal Exchange were
            sued by a company that claimed they conspired to restrict zinc
            supplies and drive up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duncan Galvanizing Corp. alleged that in 2010 Goldman
            Sachs, JPMorgan and Glencore each acquired one of the world's
            three biggest metals warehouse operators, giving them control
            over the London Metals Exchange, where 90 percent of zinc metals
            futures are traded, according to a complaint filed today in
            Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duncan, based in Everett, Massachusetts, provides
            protective coatings for steel. It claims the defendants
            conspired to drive up prices by artificially limiting zinc
            supplies. Duncan is seeking to represent a class of purchasers
            of LME-grade zinc for physical delivery in the U.S., from May
            24, 2010, to the present. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, said the firm intends to contest the lawsuit. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York based
            JPMorgan Chase, and
            Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Glencore, based in Baar,
            Switzerland, both declined to comment. Miriam Heywood, a
            spokeswoman for the London Metal Exchange, didn't immediately
            respond to an e-mail sent after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Manhattan courthouse where the zinc suit is filed has
            become a hub of commodities price-fixing claims in recent
            months. Suits have been filed over aluminum warehousing and oil
            futures. U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni is overseeing 24
            suits claiming manipulation of the benchmark used to set prices
            in the $18 trillion global gold market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The zinc suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
            tripled under U.S. antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Duncan Galvanizing Corp. v. The London Metal
            Exchange Ltd., 14-cv-03728, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Hires JPMorgan's Moge for Insurance Investing Post</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired Neil Moge from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to lead a London-based
            team
            overseeing investments for insurers amid an expansion of asset
            management in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moge was named executive director and head of insurance
            portfolio management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
            according to a memo last month from Mike Siegel, global head of
            Goldman Sachs's insurance asset management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, and
            No. 1 JPMorgan are among firms vying to manage money for
            insurance companies facing pressure from low bond yields and new
            regulation. New York-based Goldman Sachs manages $133 billion
            for insurance clients, according to June 30 figures on the
            company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Neil will play an integral role as we continue to expand
            our insurance business in Europe and the United Kingdom,'
            Siegel said in the memo. 'Neil has an extensive background in
            investment management for insurance companies.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moge had been an executive director at New York-based
            JPMorgan's global insurance solutions team, where he managed
            client relationships. Prior to joining JPMorgan, he was an
            investment director at RSA Insurance Group Plc and also held
            money-management roles at Axa SA and Prudential Plc's MG
            business, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He will report to John Melvin, chief investment officer of
            the insurance asset management unit, and Iain Lindsay, co-head
            of global fixed income portfolio management. Moge has a
            bachelor's degree in history and a master's in medieval studies
            from the University of Bristol in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's asset management unit in June announced the
            hiring in London of Prashant Sharma from Goldman Sachs as head
            of international fixed-income investments for insurance clients.
            Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
            comment on the departure. She said the company has about $90
            billion in assets under management at the global insurance
            solutions business. &lt;/p&gt;
