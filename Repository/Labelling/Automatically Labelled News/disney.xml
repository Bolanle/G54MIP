&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Pixar announced
plans to release 'Finding Dory,' a sequel to its 2003 animated
blockbuster 'Finding Nemo,' with Ellen DeGeneres returning as
the voice of the forgetful blue tang fish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film is scheduled to reach theaters on Nov. 25, 2015,
Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement.
Director Andrew Stanton, who won a best animated picture Oscar
for the original film, will return to helm the sequel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequel, set partly on the California coast, will
include returning characters, such as Nemo and his father
Marlin, as well as new ones, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I have waited for this day for a long, long, long, long,
long, long time,' DeGeneres, a talk show host, said in the
statement. 'I'm not mad it took this long. I know the people at
Pixar were busy creating 'Toy Story 16.' But the time they took
was worth it. The script is fantastic.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Finding Nemo' took in $921.7 million worldwide in ticket
sales on a budget of $94 million, according to researcher
BoxOfficeMojo.com. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) said
it will file an immediate appeal when the final judgment is
entered in its patent dispute with Carnegie Mellon University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hamilton, Bermuda-based chipmaker made the statement
after a federal judge in Pittsburgh on March 31 added another
$367 million to the damages Marvell must pay the school for
patent infringement. That ruling brought total damages to more
than $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge did reject the school's request for double or
triple damages, saying the company wasn't sufficiently
capitalized to withstand such a penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Carnegie Mellon University v. Marvell
Technology Group Ltd., 09-cv-00290, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple-Samsung Jury Is Seated in $2 Billion Patent Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s and Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)'s opening
arguments in a $2 billion trial over smartphone technology were
heard by a jury that includes a retired International Business
Machines Corp. software systems manager, a medical billing
administrator and a community service officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury was chosen March 31 in the same San Jose,
California, courtroom where jurors two years ago found that
Samsung infringed Apple's patents and awarded $1.05 billion in
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patent 'Troll' Dig Gets Congress to Ponder What's in a Name &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes 'patent trolls,' even if they're not quite
sure what they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a term without clear definition and yet it's being
used to push Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court right now to
curb abusive litigation without damaging a centuries-old system
designed to promote advances in science and industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers and companies like Google Inc. (GOOG) say they are too
often targets of lawsuits and have taken out newspaper and radio
advertisements deriding 'trolls.' Companies like 3M Co. (MMM), Eli
Lilly  Co. and General Electric Co. (GE) warn that proposals to
limit litigation could go too far and damage a part of the
economy that the Commerce Department says generated 5.3 percent
of U.S. gross domestic product in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase 'patent troll' originated with Intel Corp.,
which was sued for libel in 1999 after its spokesman, Chuck
Mulloy, called a firm that had sued the chipmaker a 'patent
extortionist' in the Wall Street Journal. A group of company
lawyers came up with the replacement phrase, Mulloy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel executives have said over the years the term refers
to anyone who stands under the bridge of progress exacting a
toll on those who try to cross, a reference to the Three Billy
Goats Gruff fairy tale. One of the lawyers who came up with the
name, Peter Detkin, now works for Bellevue, Washington's
Intellectual Ventures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disney Tells U.S. It May Oppose 'DeadMau5' Mark Issuance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), holder of the Mickey Mouse trademarks,
told the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office it may try to block
issuance of a trademark to DeadMau5, a performer who wears a
mouse head mask with crossed-out eyes, according to the
Hollywood Reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel Zimmerman, who performs as DeadMau5, filed the
application in the name of his Ronica Holdings Ltd. and said he
plans to use the mark -- a mouse-head caricature -- on products
including food and BMX bikes and in entertainment, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;False Assignment Papers Don't Bar Settlement Pay, Court Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal magistrate judge overstepped his authority in a
copyright-infringement case by ordering the repayment of money
received in settlement from various plaintiffs, a Minnesota
court ruled March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came in a case involving alleged unauthorized
film downloading. A California court found that the copyright
assignment documents used in both courts were fraudulent. The
magistrate then ordered the law firm representing the plaintiff
-- a maker of adult films -- to repay money received in the
settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal court in Minnesota said the submission of the
assignment documents -- 'legitimate or not, authorized or not'
-- didn't amount to a fraud on the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are AF Holdings LLC v. Doe, 12-cv-01445, 12-cv-01446, 12-cv-01447, 12-cv-01448 and 12-cv-01449, U.S.

&lt;h2&gt;Kardashians Seek Confidentiality for Licensing Agreements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kardashian family, described in court papers as 'among
the most famous, recognizable and widely viewed public figures
today,' asked a federal judge to seal documents relating to the
family's licensing agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family is involved in a 2012 trademark dispute with Lee
Tillett, a Florida makeup artist, over its use of 'Khroma.'
Releasing the details of various licensing deals 'could be used
by other prospective licensors and competitors of the
Kardashians, to their advantage,' the family said in a March 26
court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Boldface Licensing Branding v. By Lee Tillett

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is halting video-
game development at its recently acquired Lucasfilm division in
an effort to cut costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, will
focus on licensing 'Star Wars' content rather than developing
games internally, Miles Perkins, a Lucasfilm spokesman, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney acquired Lucasfilm, the business founded by director
George Lucas last year for about $4 billion. LucasArts, the
company's video-game unit, was established in 1982 and its
catalog has included titles such as 'Lego Star Wars' and
'Star Wars Battlefront,' according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from internal development to licensing is designed
to minimize 'risk while achieving a broader portfolio of
quality Star Wars games,' the company said in a statement. 'As
a result of this change, we've had layoffs across the
organization,' according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perkins declined to say how many Lucasfilm jobs will be
affected. The company employs more than 1,800 people in San
Francisco and other locations, he said. Lucasfilm is looking for
external partners to complete games currently in development
such as 'Star Wars 1313,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell less than 1
percent to $57.25 at the close in New York. The shares are up 15
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was reported earlier by the website
GameInformer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Enterprises Inc., Warner
Bros. Entertainment Inc. and four other movie studios accused
the closed file-sharing service Megaupload.com of massive theft
of intellectual property in a copyright-infringement lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While billing itself as a private data storage provider,
Megaupload.com functioned as a hub for uploading and downloading
copyrighted movies and TV shows, according to the complaint
filed today in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, which
names Megaupload Ltd., the owner of the Megaupload.com website,
company founder Kim Dotcom, a second company and two other
individuals as defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom was accused in an indictment unsealed in January
2012 of belonging to a global criminal organization prosecutors
called Mega Conspiracy that was involved in copyright
infringement and money laundering and generated more than $175
million in illicit proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'When Megaupload.com was shut down in 2012 by U.S. law
enforcement, it was by all estimates the largest and most active
infringing website targeting creative content in the world,'
Steven Fabrizio, senior executive vice president and global
general counsel of the Motion Picture Association of America,
said in today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com had 'a business model designed to encourage
theft -- and make its owners very rich in the process,'
Fabrizio said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Bogus' Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The @MPAA repeats bogus DOJ claims that we induced
copyright infringement. No. 1 reward rule published on MU site:
'No copyright infringement,'' according to a post on Kim
Dotcom's Twitter feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studios' lawsuit is a meritless re-hash of issues
raised in the criminal case, Ira Rothken, Dotcom's San Rafael,
California-based attorney, said in a phone interview. 'We will
vigorously defend against the claims,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com built up its library of illicit offerings by
encouraging users to upload movies and other entertainment
through an 'Uploader Rewards' program. Amounts paid through
the program were based on how often pirated material was
downloaded for viewing by others, according to the studios'
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megaupload.com made money by charging subscriptions
enabling faster downloads and by selling advertising on the
heavily trafficked website, the movie makers said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rewards Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothken said the rewards program was limited to files that
are far too small to transmit movies. The studios' assertion the
rewards program encouraged copyright infringement 'wouldn't
pass the giggle test,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dotcom and two others named in the complaint, Mathias
Ortman, a German citizen, and Bram van der Kolk, a Dutch
citizen, are fighting extradition from New Zealand, according to
Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortman and van der Kolk provided technological expertise to
Megaupload and are part-owners of it, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, a New Zealand appeals court ruled that search
warrants used in a 2012 raid on Dotcom's home were valid,
bolstering the U.S. effort to extradite him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit also names Vester Ltd., a Hong Kong company of
which Dotcom is the sole shareholder. Vester is majority
shareholder of Megaupload Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the unit of Burbank, California-based Walt Disney (DIS)
Co., plaintiffs in the case include Paramount Pictures Corp.,
Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, Columbia Pictures
Industries Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Twentieth Century Fox v. Megaupload.com, 14-cv-362, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

Ahearn" datetime="Apr 08, 2013  1:53 PM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-08/annette-funicello-tv-s-beloved-disney-mouseketeer-dies-at-70.html"><headline>Annette Funicello, TV's Beloved Disney Mouseketeer, Dies at 70</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Annette Funicello, whose youthful
charm made her the most popular of the original Mouseketeers on
Walt Disney's 'The Mickey Mouse Club' television show, has
died. She was 70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died today at Mercy Southwest Hospital in Bakersfield,
California, according to a statement from Walt Disney Co. (DIS), based
in Burbank, California. The cause was complications from
multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease. In 1992
she said she had been diagnosed with the ailment since 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one of the most popular children's TV shows of the
1950s, Funicello established herself as the most beloved of the
two dozen young performers known as Mouseketeers. Her Italian-
American ancestry gave her, at 12, dark brunette curls to go
along with a dimpled smile that was at once shy and enticing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picked personally by Walt Disney for the cast, Funicello
became the only Mouseketeer kept on contract after the show's
four-season run. She went on to a career in music and film,
including a series of popular beach movies that paired her with
Frankie Avalon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She never was scantily clad in those movies, keeping a
promise to Disney that she wouldn't show her navel on screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'She's the perfect girl next door,' Avalon once said.
'She doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She's the sweetest
girl I know, and nothing's ever changed.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her 1994 memoir, 'A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,'
Funicello wrote that the carefully scrubbed innocence of 'The
Mickey Mouse Club' was 'an honest if exaggerated reflection of
an America that, sadly, has faded into history.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Accidental Stardom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An accidental celebrity, Funicello pronounced her last name
'Fun-is-sello' to downplay her heritage, she said, and once
proposed changing it to Turner. Disney instead urged her to
start using the correct pronunciation -- 'Foon-i-chello' -- in
public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Joanne Funicello was born on Oct. 22, 1942, in
Utica, New York, the first child of first-generation Italian-
Americans. Her father, Joe, was a master auto mechanic who met
his future wife, Virginia Albano, at her brother's diner, where
she worked as a secretary and hostess. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 2, Funicello could sing the words to every top popular
song, with a special affection for Johnny Mercer's 'Accentuate
the Positive,' she recalled in her memoir. Still, when her
parents packed up for California in 1946, when she was 4 and her
brother Joey was nine months, it was to chase not stardom but
warmer weather, she said. Another brother, Michael, was born
after the family settled in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Auditions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funicello took drum and dance lessons and, at 12, had the
lead role in her dance school's performance of 'Swan Lake.'
Among those in the audience was Disney, who was looking for
child performers for his new show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was invited to audition, then called back twice to try
out for what was, she later learned, the final spot in the cast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two dozen Mouseketeers were divided into three groups.
Funicello was among the eight who performed the show's opening
and closing numbers. Other original cast members included Johnny
Crawford, later a bandleader and a star of the TV series 'The
Rifleman;' Paul Petersen, who would appear on 'The Donna Reed
Show;' and two sons of actor Mickey Rooney, Tim and Mickey Jr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mouseketeers debuted in a national TV special on July
17, 1955, the day Disneyland opened. The series aired on ABC
from 1955 to 1958. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the show ceased production in 1959, the studio moved
Funicello into singing and film acting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first recording, 'How Will I Know My Love?' sold
several hundred thousand copies, and she broke the Top 10 in
1959 with 'Tall Paul,' which she performed on Dick Clark's
'American Bandstand.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Celebrating Innocence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first film was 'The Shaggy Dog' (1959), with Fred
MacMurray, followed by 'Babes in Toyland' (1961). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Beach Party' (1963) paired Funicello with her longtime
friend, Avalon, in a celebration of youth, sun, surfing and
innocent flirtation. Its success led to sequels including
'Muscle Beach Party' (1964) and 'Beach Blanket Bingo'
(1965). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I knew it would be a lot of fun,' Funicello wrote of her
first movie. 'But never in a million years did I or anyone else
associated with the film dream it would evolve into such a
timeless gem of pop-culture Americana.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and Avalon co-hosted a failed TV music-variety show in
1976 called 'Easy Does It.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of her final performances, she and Avalon returned
to the screen in 'Back to the Beach' (1987), playing parents
visiting their surf-loving daughter in California. She was
diagnosed with MS while making the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I think you only have two choices in this kind of
situation,' she said in making her diagnosis public in 1992.
'Either you give in to it or you fight it. I intend to fight.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She made few public appearances in subsequent years. To
help in the fight against the disease, she created the Annette
Funicello Research Fund for Neurological Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funicello was married to Jack Gilardi, her manager, from
1965 until their divorce in 1981. They had a daughter, Gina, and
two sons, Jack Jr. and Jason. She married horse trainer Glen
Holt in 1986. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven years after its acquisition by Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Pixar, the studio known for 'Toy Story' and 'Finding Nemo,' was facing three crises, according to a new book by its president, Ed Catmull. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of making animated films was rising, the DVD market was shrinking and there was a feeling among management that a tenet of the Pixar culture, employees' freedom to speak their minds, was faltering, Catmull says in 'Creativity, Inc.,' released today by Random House. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After buying Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, Walt Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger put Catmull and Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter at the helm of both their studio and Disney's animation unit. The wisdom of that decision has been evident in the unit's success, including with the Oscar-winner 'Frozen,' the top-grossing animated film of all time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Less well-known are what Catmull, 69, says were growing pains and soul-searching at Pixar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'How, we all wondered, could we maintain Pixar's sense of intensity and playfulness, beating back the creeping conservatism that often accompanies success while also getting leaner and more nimble?' Catmull writes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He quotes Lasseter as saying, 'There's a lightness and a speed at Disney that I want to see more of at Pixar.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Tough' Criticism &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catmull and others in management assembled more than 1,000 employees in the atrium of its headquarters in Emeryville, California, for an event it called Notes Day in March 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees were asked in advance to share suggestions for topics, their complaints and ways for the company to improve. Lasseter received two-and-a-half pages of criticism. Among them were concerns he was so tightly scheduled that people wasted time overpreparing for meetings and that he carried his emotions from one meeting to the next, leaving some thinking he was mad at them when he wasn't, according to the book. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Those two-and-a-half pages were really tough to read,' Lasseter told employees that day, according to the book. 'But it was so valuable for me to hear, and I'm already working to correct those things.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Ferguson, a former Disney animator who left last year and now teaches at the California Institute for the Arts in Valencia, said competition for Lasseter's attention was an issue at the studio. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's like children fighting over their parents,' Ferguson said in an interview. 'He was being spread awfully thin. Any time anybody had with him was precious.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Biggest Payoff' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catmull says in the book that one goal of Notes Day was figuring out how to cut costs by 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In November, Pixar fired about 5 percent of its 1,200 workers and closed a Vancouver, Canada, facility. The studio said at the time that it would delay the release of the film 'The Good Dinosaur' until November 2015, making this the first year since 2005 that Pixar isn't putting out a movie. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its last film, 2013's 'Monsters University,' grossed $738 million in theaters worldwide; its budget was $270 million, including the cost of distributing and marketing the film, according to Boxoffice.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees discussed 106 topics in 171 sessions during the the Notes Day event, according to the book. Afterward, they were treated to beer and hot dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I believe the biggest payoff of Notes Day was that we made it safer for people to say what they thought,' Catmull said in his book. 'Notes Day made it OK to disagree.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.3 percent to $78.88 at 11:46 a.m. in New York. The stock had gained 3.6 percent this year as of yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="Apr 10, 2013  1:08 PM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-10/disney-eliminates-jobs-from-studio-division-in-cost-cutting-push.html"><headline>Disney Eliminates Film Studio Jobs After Cost-Cutting Review</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world's
largest entertainment company, cut 150 jobs from its film studio
as part of a cost review, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firings amount to about 2 percent of the unit's 7,000
jobs, said the person, who sought anonymity because the number
isn't being publicly announced. Burbank, California-based Disney
announced the action in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firings took place across various studio operations.
Disney has been releasing fewer films and selling fewer DVDs.
The cuts are in addition to those made earlier this year in its
interactive businesses, where console-based video games have
lost ground to mobile and Facebook games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'As part of an ongoing review to ensure that the studios'
operational structure and economics align with the demands of
the current marketplace, we have made the difficult decision to
reduce our staffing levels in several divisions of the studio,'
the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is releasing 10 movies in 2013, down from 38 a
decade ago, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. Sales from
the home-entertainment unit, part of the film studio, fell 9
percent to $2.22 billion last year, on a 12 percent drop in
units, according to the company's annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company finished fiscal 2012 with 166,000 employees
overall, up 6.4 percent. Disney earned $5.68 billion on sales of
$42.3 billion in the 12 months ended Sept. 29, a second year of
record profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the company, Disney closed its Junction Point
Studios video-game operation in Austin, Texas, in January and
announced April 3 it was reducing staff at the games unit of
recently acquired Lucasfilm Ltd. to focus on licensing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from interactive games and subscriptions dropped 20
percent to $613 million in the latest fiscal year, reflecting a
29 percent decrease in games for console-based systems such as
Sony Corp.'s PlayStation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, has been making new
all-time highs in recent days. The stock gained 1.1 percent to

&lt;p&gt;The former Maker Studios Inc. chief
executive officer who last year accused the board of ousting him
and taking control of the company through fraud is seeking to
delay a shareholder vote on the acquisition by Walt Disney Co. (DIS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny Zappin and three other co-founders of Maker yesterday
asked California state court judge in Los Angeles to block the
April 15 vote because, they said, the notice to shareholders is
misleading. They had sought a hearing as early as today. No
hearing was held today, according to court staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will pay as much as $950 million for the supplier of
video content for Google Inc.'s YouTube, the Burbank,
California-based entertainment company said last month. With
more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and 5.5
billion views a month on YouTube, Maker is one of the top
online-video networks for young audiences, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Certain Maker directors illegally issued shares to
themselves and diluted the common stock for their own financial
gain to the detriment of other Maker shareholders and take
control of Makers' board so that they could rapidly create a
liquidity event,' Zappin said in yesterday's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Spiegel, a lawyer representing Culver City,
California-based Maker, and Dean Kitchens, a lawyer representing
the company's board members, didn't immediately respond to phone
calls seeking comment on yesterday's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Katz v. Donovan, BC513284, California Superior
Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMC Entertainment Inc., the second-
largest U.S. cinema chain, said it isn't selling advance tickets
to the Marvel film 'Iron Man 3' because it hasn't worked out
terms with distributor Walt Disney Co. (DIS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We hope to reach agreement and get tickets on sale as
soon as possible so it doesn't affect opening weekend,' Ryan
Noonan, an AMC spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, is set
to release 'Iron Man 3' on May 3 in the U.S. to kick off the
summer movie season. The film, which stars Robert Downey Jr. and
Gwyneth Paltrow, is projected to gross $151 million in its first
weekend, the estimate of researcher Boxoffice.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be the biggest opening weekend so far in 2013.
Disney is using the blockbuster sequel to seek better terms on
future films with theater owners, Deadline.com reported
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, didn't respond to
requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestic box office receipts are down 11 percent this year
to $2.62 billion, according to Hollywood.com. Disney's Marvel
had the top-grossing film last year with 'The Avengers.'
Disney also owns Pixar and Lucasfilm, the maker of the 'Star
Wars' movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Version &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said on March 30 it will release a separate version
of 'Iron Man 3' in China, and won't seek official Chinese co-
production status for the comic-book based film. The picture was
partly made in China with Beijing-based partner DMG
Entertainment. A release date for the Chinese version wasn't
announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney slipped 0.1 percent to $60.68 at the close in New
York, down from yesterday's all-time high. The shares have
advanced 22 percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent gain
for the SP 500 Stock Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMC, second to Regal Entertainment Group (RGC) in the U.S., was
acquired by China's Dalian Wanda Group in September 2012. The
chain is based in Kansas City, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russ Nunley, a spokesman for Knoxville, Tennessee-based
Regal, declined to comment on any discussions with Disney. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regal Entertainment Group (RGC), the
largest U.S. theater chain, stopped selling advance tickets to
Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s 'Iron Man 3' in a fee dispute with the
studio, a person with knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regal joins the second-largest cinema operator, AMC
Entertainment, in halting sales for the film from Disney's
Marvel unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regal's action was reported earlier by Deadline.com. and
the Los Angeles Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="Apr 17, 2014  6:14 PM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-17/disney-officials-say-online-offerings-boost-espn-audience.html"><headline>Disney Officials Say Online Offerings Boost ESPN Audience</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) executives said
consumers who listen to ESPN radio and interact with the sports
channel's websites spend triple the amount of time with the
company as those who just watch the TV network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans who take part in ESPN.com's fantasy football or use
the Watch ESPN app are with the company 17 hours a month on
average, versus five hours for people who only watch TV. The
data demonstrate that online and mobile offerings boost
engagement with ESPN, as well as the potential for ad sales,
executives told analysts today at ESPN's offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's exploded the misconception that digital media would
cannibalize television,' Arthur Bulgrin, ESPN's senior vice
president of global research and analytics, said at the investor
event in Bristol, Connecticut. 'The overall time spent with
ESPN media more than triples and at the same time TV viewing
goes up. It's a rising tide that floats all boats.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, is using
the event to showcase ESPN, one of the company's most profitable
businesses, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new studio ESPN plans to begin using next month for its
flagship 'SportsCenter' news show is a 'great example of us
investing in the value of a franchise, investing not only to
continue to protect it but to continue to grow its value,' Iger
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN's online offerings attract larger audiences than Yahoo
Sports, Bleacher Report and NFL.com, Bulgrin said. Mobile use by
customers also exceeds the time spent on desktop computers, he
said. Watch ESPN's typical user is 29 years old, compared with
age 47 for the traditional TV viewer. The median income of
$74,000 is 54 percent more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing Habits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TV networks, which accounted for more than half of Disney's
profit, face challenges from new video options, the migration of
ad sales to online media and escalating costs for sports rights,
ESPN President John Skipper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal Disney signed last month that lets Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) create a Web-based service with its programming will
attract customers who don't have pay TV now, rather than ones
who trade down from an existing service, Skipper said. He
expects more such deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Pay television is going to remain a large business,
though it will exist in a more complicated and dynamic
atmosphere, which will require some evolution of our current
business model,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 1.3 percent to
$79.99 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 4.7
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="Apr 17, 2014 11:21 AM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-17/disney-offers-obama-minimum-wage-to-florida-park-workers.html"><headline>Disney Offers Obama Minimum Wage to Florida Park Workers</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has offered to
raise starting pay at its Florida theme parks by 25 percent to
$10 an hour over two years, almost matching the federal minimum
wage sought by President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney presented the proposal yesterday to the Service
Trades Council, a consortium of six labor groups, the company
and union representatives said. They are scheduled to resume
bargaining over a contract on May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unions, which represent more than 30,000 employees at
Walt Disney World near Orlando, asked for at least $10.10 an
hour, the amount congressional Democrats and Obama propose as a
new U.S. minimum. Starting pay at the Florida parks is now $8.03
an hour, according to Burbank, California-based Disney. That
would reach the rate Disney is offering by July 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I'm very pleased,' Ed Chambers, president of the
council, said in a telephone interview. 'We're well on our way
to getting a deal done.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract being negotiated covers full-time hourly
employees at the world's most-popular theme-park complex. Disney
reported record profit of $6.6 billion on revenue of $45 billion
last year from its TV networks, parks, studios and consumer
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It is more generous than they have been in the past,'
said Donna-Lynne Dalton, secretary-treasurer of the council.
'It comes at a cost.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also told the unions it wants to stop offering
pensions to new hourly employees starting in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New hires would be offered a 3 percent company match to a
401(k)-style retirement plan, said Dalton. The company doesn't
currently contribute to that plan, which is available to
employees from bell staff to costumed entertainers, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Union Opposition &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chambers said the union would oppose the pension change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This offer reflects our appreciation and care for our
cast members and our commitment to providing a leading
employment package,' Kim Prunty, a Disney World spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. 'We look forward to working with
the union and engaging in constructive negotiations to finalize
and reach a collective bargaining agreement.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's last contract with the council took effect in
October 2010, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The pact
included annual raises of 3 percent to 4 percent for workers who
hadn't already reached the top of their pay scales, as well as
$650 one-time bonuses for non-tipped, full-time employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's parks and resorts business, the company's second-largest division after television, generated operating income of
$2.22 billion last year on sales of $14.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer,
said at the annual meeting in March the company has good
relations with its unions and doesn't expect that to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It is our intention to behave very responsibly and fairly
with all of our cast members and compensate them in ways that
reflect the value that they create for the company and for our
customers,' Iger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.7 percent to $79.53 at 11:18 a.m. in New
York. The stock had gained 30 percent in the past year through
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Anousha Sakoui and Jon Erlichman" datetime="Apr 22, 2014  1:38 PM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-22/filming-of-disney-s-star-wars-movie-under-way-in-abu-dhabi.html"><headline>Disney's 'Star Wars' Filming Gets Under Way in Abu Dhabi</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The first 'Star Wars' movie to be
made under Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has begun shooting in Abu Dhabi,
according to Alan Horn, chairman of the company's film division,
who said the casting will be announced soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horn spoke at a Bloomberg Business of Entertainment event
today in New York, before heading to the U.K. with other Disney
executives overseeing the project. Filming thus far has involved
secondary scenes, he said. The U.K.'s Pinewood Studios will be
the primary site, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We have to give it that 'Star Wars'-ian look,' Horn
said. 'So we need to go to different places that give us the
right look and feel.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie, to be released in December 2015, will be the
seventh 'Star Wars' picture from Lucasfilm, purchased in 2012
by Disney in a $4.05 billion bet on the franchise created by
George Lucas. Lucas is a consultant on the film, Horn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's studio chairman emphasized the importance of the
faster-growing international box office in approving projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The challenge is to have pictures that can travel,' Horn
said. 'We've learned that these tentpole movies are most
desired all around the world.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horn has led a revival of the Walt Disney Studios, which
include the company's original live-action and animation
businesses, along with Marvel and Pixar. Since his arrival in
June 2012, two Disney films have topped $1 billion in worldwide
ticket sales: 'Iron Man 3' and 'Frozen.' 'Captain America:
The Winter Soldier,' the latest Marvel superhero movie, has led
the box office for three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baseball Feature &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month, Disney is scheduled to release the baseball
movie 'Million Dollar Arm,' starring 'Mad Men' actor Jon Hamm. The film is testing 'extremely well,' Horn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' film is possible, Horn
said. While he hasn't seen a screenplay he's ready to approve,
he's 'very confident' Disney will get one. The four pictures
produced thus far generated worldwide ticket sales of $3.73
billion, according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Disney, Horn was president of Time Warner
Inc.'s Warner Bros. for 12 years, where he co-lead the studio
that made the 'Harry Potter' and 'Dark Knight' franchises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horn indicated Disney may revert to a May release for the
two additional 'Star Wars' films that are planned as part of
the latest trilogy. The current production will have a 'big
tentpole movie budget,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such films typically cost $175 million to $200 million,
give or take, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We need to give the audience, essentially, a full meal in
return for their affection and devotion and love for these
properties.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) won approval to
release 'Iron Man 3' in China on May 3, offering a separate
version aimed at enhancing the film's appeal in the world's
second-largest movie market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release date for the picture, produced by Disney's
Marvel unit and Beijing-based DMG Entertainment, was announced
yesterday in an e-mail. 'Iron Man 3,' one of the company's big
summer films, opens the same the day in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retooled version of 'Iron Man 3' will highlight
Chinese actors and include additional China footage, according
to the company. Burbank, California-based Disney, along with
other studios, is trying to meet local tastes and satisfy a
censorship board. A simultaneous release in both countries
reduces the risk of piracy cutting into sales in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There are very few foreign films that get that
opportunity,' said Robert Cain, a film producer and consultant
for studios working in China. 'It doesn't allow any time for
piracy to eat into 'Iron Man 3' grosses.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. opening of 'Iron Man 3' has been clouded by a
dispute between Disney and large U.S. and Canadian cinema
operators over how ticket revenue will be shared. Regal
Entertainment Group, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., Cinemark
Holdings Inc. and Toronto-based Cineplex Inc. aren't offering
advance sales during negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,
the second-largest U.S. cinema chain, settled a revenue-sharing
dispute with Walt Disney Co. (DIS) over 'Iron Man 3,' leaving two
big U.S. chains in a stalemate over the first big summer movie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets are available for showings starting at 9 p.m. on
May 2, Kansas City, Missouri-based AMC Entertainment said today
in an e-mailed statement. Terms of the revenue-sharing agreement
weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We thank our partners at Disney for working with us to
achieve economical terms so we can present our guests with one
of the biggest blockbusters of 2013 and solidly kick off the
summer movie season,' AMC said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the accord, Disney has reached agreement with one of
the three largest U.S. chains, which have resisted the studio's
demand for a bigger share of ticket sales. Discussions are under
way with Regal Entertainment Group (RGC), the No. 1 U.S. chain, and a
deal may be reached today, according to a person with knowledge
of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, which also plans to release 'Monsters
University,' 'The Lone Ranger' and 'Planes' this summer,
has focused on big-budget movies since buying Pixar, Marvel and
Lucasfilm. Such films typically command a larger share of the
box-office take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Iron Man' is going to be a hit no matter what, but you
don't want this kind of tension going into the most lucrative
part of the year.' Phil Contrino, chief analyst for researcher
Boxoffice.com, said in a telephone interview. 'It's a relief.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movie's Open &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK), the third-largest U.S. chain,
wasn't selling tickets today through the website Fandango. As of
yesterday, Cineplex Inc. (CGX), the largest exhibitor based in Canada,
also wasn't selling tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrino estimates 'Iron Man 3' will take in $151 million
in its opening weekend, better than 2010's 'Iron Man 2' and
below last year's top-grossing film, 'Marvel's The Avengers,'
which generated $207.4 million domestically its opening weekend.
Contrino said the slate of movies being released in May could
lift results in the second-quarter above last year's. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Roeder, a spokesman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, didn't respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, added
0.1 percent to $62 at the close in New York. The shares have
climbed 25 percent this year. Regal, based in Knoxville,
Tennessee, added 1.4 percent to $17.66. Cinemark, based in
Plano, Texas, added 0.7 percent to $29.10. AMC is owned by
China's Dalian Wanda Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summer Season &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer accounted for $4.3 billion, or almost 40 percent of
last year's record $10.8 billion in ticket revenue in the U.S.
and Canada, according to the researcher BoxOfficeMojo.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, studios get about 52 percent of ticket revenue
after cinema operators deduct a small percentage for overhead,
according to Eric Wold, an analyst at B. Riley  Co. in San
Francisco. Bigger movies may command more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has asked for as much as 65 percent of the revenue,
the Los Angeles Times has reported. The newspaper reported the
agreement with AMC earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

The No. 3 chain, Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK), also agreed to sell
tickets, according to a Disney spokesman. Terms weren't
disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the accords, Disney's Marvel unit and the exhibitors
avert a potentially costly dispute. The chains had resisted the
studio's demand for a bigger share of ticket sales. 'Iron Man
3' is projected to be one of the biggest movies of the year,
with opening weekend sales of $151 million in the U.S.,
according to Boxoffice.com. The summer season accounts for about
40 percent of annual domestic cinema sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We thank our partners at Disney for working with us to
achieve economical terms so we can present our guests with one
of the biggest blockbusters of 2013 and solidly kick off the
summer movie season,' AMC said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has focused on
franchise pictures like 'Toy Story,' 'Iron Man' and 'Star
Wars,' and is using its most popular films to seek better terms
from theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negotiating Clout &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based company, which also plans to
release 'Monsters University,' 'The Lone Ranger' and
'Planes' this summer, has spent $15 billion since 2006
purchasing the Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm film studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big budget movies typically command a larger share of the
box-office take than the average for studios, which get about 52
percent of annual ticket revenue after cinema operators deduct a
small percentage for overhead, according to Eric Wold, an
analyst at B. Riley  Co. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney had asked for as much as 65 percent of the revenue,
the Los Angeles Times reported this week. Cinemark spokesman
James Meredith didn't respond to requests for comment. The other
companies declined to discuss their negotiations in detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Iron Man' is going to be a hit no matter what, but you
don't want this kind of tension going into the most lucrative
part of the year.' Phil Contrino, chief analyst for researcher
Boxoffice.com, said in a telephone interview. 'It's a relief.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Movie's Open &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Iron Man 2,' released in 2010, opened with $128.1
million in U.S. weekend sales, according to Box Office Mojo.
Last year's top-grossing film, 'Marvel's The Avengers,'
generated $207.4 million. Contrino said the slate of movies
being released in May could lift results in the second quarter
above last year's. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, was
little changed at $61.95 at 10:18 a.m. in New York. The shares
had climbed 25 percent this year through yesterday. Regal, based
in Knoxville, Tennessee, slipped 0.1 percent to $17.64.
Cinemark, in Plano, Texas, added less than 1 percent to $29.11.
AMC is owned by China's Dalian Wanda Group Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer accounted for $4.3 billion of last year's record
$10.8 billion in ticket revenue in the U.S. and Canada,
according to the researcher Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The love fest between little girls
and the film 'Frozen' helped Walt Disney Co. (DIS) maintain its
domination of the U.S. licensed toy industry last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsa dolls and other 'Frozen' merchandise sold better
than any other licensed toys in the first three months of the
year, according to NPD Group Inc. The animated movie, released
in November, has generated more than $1.1 billion in ticket
sales, according to Box Office Mojo. That's made it the highest-grossing animated film of all time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Disney, the 'Frozen' surge is helping continue its
winning streak in toy licensing. The company had four of the top
five toy franchises in the first quarter, including Disney
Princess, Mickey  Friends and Star Wars. The lone non-Disney
franchise was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, owned by Viacom Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Cars,' another Disney property, led the list last year,
when retail sales of from licensed toys climbed to $5.3 billion,
according to Port Washington, New York-based NPD. The toy
industry is increasingly relying on entertainment franchises to
spur sales. While total U.S. toy sales declined 1 percent last
year, revenue from licenses rose 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, also dominated the
list of fastest-growing licenses last quarter with three titles:
'Frozen,' 'Planes' and 'Sofia the First.' The top spot
went to toys based on 'Despicable Me,' owned by Comcast
Corp.'s Universal Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention is seeking a patent on the Ebola virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the application EP 2350270 A2, which was filed
in 2010, the CDC is claiming the rights to a strain of the virus
that was isolated from a patient in the Ivory Coast. It was
deposited with the center in November 2007, and the CDC says one
of its proposed uses is screening for an antibody that can be
used to treat infected patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has infected
more than 1,400 people and killed upward of 825 since March 1,
according to the World Health Organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Virginia Governor Declines to Address Redskins Trademark Debate &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said he won't weigh in on
the trademark controversy surrounding the name of the Washington
Redskins National Football League team, ESPN reported. The team
trains in his state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governor said all of the team's players live in
Virginia, with residents of the state holding the majority of
the team's season tickets, ESPN reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAuliffe, a Democrat, spoke at a visit to the team's
training camp. He said he's 'not in the business of telling
private businesses what to do,' and that what's important about
the team is the economic activity it creates for Virginia,
according to ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week Hillary Clinton said she opposed the team name,
which is the subject of proceedings at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office brought by native Americans who contend the
team name is racist, according to ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Australian Trademark Sought for Downed Malaysia Flight Number &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Malaysian company has applied in Australia to register
MH17 as a trademark, the Design  Trend news website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MH17 is the number of the Malaysia Airline System Bhd (MAS)'s
flight that crashed in the Ukraine July 17, killing all aboard,
according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remit Now International of Kuala Lumpur applied for the
mark in a category that can cover game shows, video games,
gallery services, film production and online games, according to
Design  Trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia operates a first-come, first-served trademark
registration system. Even though Malaysia Airline also submitted
an application, Remit Now's request is more likely to be granted
because it was in first, according to Design  Trend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New York Restaurant Changes Name After Infringement Suit Filed &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood  Sand LLC, a Buffalo, New York-based cocktail bar
and restaurant chain, is changing its name one day after the
filing of a trademark suit by a Missouri-based members-only bar
and restaurant with the same name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an Aug. 1 posting on its Facebook page, the Buffalo
establishment said that because of 'an unfortunate series of
legal complications,' the restaurant's name would be changed.
The restaurant, which is due to open Aug. 15, said it is
soliciting suggestions from the public for a new name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood  Sand, LLC of St. Louis filed the infringement suit
July 30, claiming the New York property's name infringed and
caused the public to be confused. According to court papers, the
Missouri restaurant registered its name with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Blood  Sand, LLC v. Blood  Sand LLC, 4:14-cv-01334, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St.
Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disney Must Face Infringement Claims Over 'Frozen' Trailer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) failed to persuade a federal court in
San Francisco to dismiss a copyright infringement suit filed by
a California resident who claims a trailer for the movie
'Frozen' infringes his computer-animated film 'The Snowman.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Wilson of Mill Valley, California, sued Disney March
28, claiming that the 'Frozen' snowman character Olaf as shown
in the trailer too strongly resembled the snowman in his film,
and that the lot, themes, dialogue, setting, pace, characters
and sequence of events in the Disney film trailer were
'substantially similar' to his film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his July 30 order, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria
said the plot and sequence of events in the Burbank, California-based Disney's trailer and the Wilson film 'have too much in
common' for a court to decide that no reasonable juror would
find 'substantial similarity' of ideas and expression. He did
dismiss Wilson's claim that the entire 'Frozen' film infringed
his 'The Snowman.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wilson v. The Walt Disney Co., 3:14-cv-01441,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Grifols's Trade Secret Case Can Go Forward, State Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grifols S.A (GRF)'s trade secrets case against three former
executives can go ahead, a North Carolina state court judge
ruled, according to the Triangle Business Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spanish blood-products company accused three ex-employees of plotting to bring the company's trade secrets,
customers and key employees to a competing venture, according to
Triangle Business Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ordered the former Grifols executives to quit
soliciting the company's employees, and barred them from using
any Grifols's confidential data, according to the publication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), becoming as well
known for Marvel superheroes as for Mickey Mouse, posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates, fueled by box-office hits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $2.25 billion, or $1.28 a share, from
$1.85 billion, or $1.01, a year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement. That beat the $1.16-a-share average of 28 analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, had two
big films for the quarter that ended June 30, with Marvel's
'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and 'Maleficent,'
according to Box Office Mojo. 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' also
from Marvel, opened last weekend with $94.3 million in domestic
cinemas, the best ever for an August release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'People said it came out of nowhere because those
characters were not well known,' Iger said of the latest film.
'The title was not well known, but the Marvel brand has become
something that, at least in the consumer's eyes, really means
something and should be trusted.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue grew 7.7 percent to $12.5 billion, surpassing the
$12.1 billion estimate, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Frozen' DVDs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income at the film studio more than doubled to
$411 million, the biggest gain among the company's five
divisions. 'Frozen,' the hit 2013 movie, continued to deliver
profit in home entertainment and international cinemas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world's largest
entertainment company, said third-quarter profit was little
changed amid costs to market the box-office disappointment 'The
Lone Ranger' and shrinking revenue at ABC television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose to $1.85 billion, or $1.01 a share, from
$1.83 billion, or $1.01, a year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement. Profit came to $1.03 a
share excluding items, compared with the $1.01 average of 30
analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Given the number of headwinds we faced, we are very
pleased with the financial results we delivered,' Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a call with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney expects to record a loss this quarter of as much as
$190 million on 'The Lone Ranger,' which cost $225 million to
make and has produced less in worldwide sales. The company's
ESPN, AE and domestic children's cable channels, along with the
popular theme parks, continue to spur growth for Disney as film
profits slide and the ABC broadcast division struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.7 percent to $65.88 in extended trading after
results came out. The stock rose 1.6 percent to $67.05 at the
close in New York and has gained 35 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co.

'Guardians of the Galaxy,' also from Marvel, opened last weekend with $94.3 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, the best ever for an August release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People said it came out of nowhere because those characters were not well known,' Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said of the latest film, in an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday. 'The title was not well known, but the Marvel brand has become something that, at least in the consumer's eyes, really means something and should be trusted.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue increased 7.7 percent to $12.5 billion, surpassing the $12.1 billion estimate, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Frozen' DVDs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operating income at the film studio more than doubled to $411 million, the biggest gain among the company's five divisions. 'Frozen,' the hit 2013 movie, continued to deliver profit in home video and international theaters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney's consumer products unit, which also benefits from Marvel-themed products, posted a 25 percent rise in profit to $273 million, while revenue grew 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The acquisitions of Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 has brought to Disney new material to attract teenage boys to its films, as well as characters for its toys, TV networks and theme parks. The film studio is well positioned for at least the next five years, Iger said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results were strong across most of Disney's businesses, according to Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst with Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'While the media networks business was roughly in line with our estimates, the company's parks, studio, consumer products and even interactive businesses showed strength,' Venkateshwar wrote in a research note. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Theme Parks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney gets the bulk of its profit from its TV division. Operating income at the unit, which includes ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channel, was little changed at $2.3 billion, as sports programming costs increased. While ABC earnings increased, profit at the much larger cable operation fell 7 percent because of higher costs at ESPN, the sale of a U.K. unit at ESPN and the shift in the timing of some revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Profit at Disney's parks increased 23 percent to $848 million, with attendance and guest spending up at its domestic resorts. The company raised daily admission prices at its Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida, twice in the past year, to $99 from $89, and benefited from the later Easter holiday, which pulled business into the quarter. Disney also is in the second year of introducing electronic wristbands that make purchases easier in the parks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The interactive unit, which makes video games, reported a profit of $29 million, compared with a year-earlier loss, fueled by sales of the company's Infinity gaming system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney's shares fell 0.2 percent to $86.59 at the close in New York today, giving them a gain this year of 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="Aug 07, 2013  4:13 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-07/disney-s-profit-stalls-as-lone-ranger-expenses-hurt-film-unit.html"><headline>Disney's Profit Stalls as 'Lone Ranger' Costs Hurt Film Unit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world's largest
entertainment company, said costs to market the box-office
disappointment 'The Lone Ranger' and shrinking revenue at ABC
television network held back third-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was little changed at $1.85 billion, or $1.01 a
share, compared with $1.83 billion, or $1.01, a year earlier,
Burbank, California-based Disney said yesterday in a statement.
Profit came to $1.03 a share excluding items, compared with the
$1.01 average of 30 analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney expects to record a loss of as much as $190 million
this quarter on 'The Lone Ranger,' which cost $225 million to
make and has produced less in box-office sales. The company's
ESPN, AE and domestic children's cable channels, along with the
popular theme parks, continue to spur growth for Disney as film
profits slide and the ABC broadcast division struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There has been a lot said I know about the risk of
basically high-cost, tentpole films, and we certainly can attest
to that given what happened with 'Lone Ranger,'' Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a call with
investors. 'We still believe that a tentpole strategy is a good
strategy. One way to rise above the din and the competition is
with a big film, not just a big budget, but a big story, big
cast, big marketing behind it.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.7 percent to $65.91 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 32 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If you strip everything aside, it was maybe a tad light
compared to what people were expecting,' Matthew Harrigan, an
analyst at Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said of the
earnings. He has a hold rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quarterly Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales increased 4.4 percent to $11.6 billion in the period
ended June 29, compared with the $11.7 billion average of 27
analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's film studio posted a 36 percent drop in profit to
to $201 million due to pre-release marketing costs of the 'The
Lone Ranger' and lower revenue from 'Iron Man 3' compared to
last year's megahit 'The Avengers.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The Lone Ranger,' featuring Armie Hammer in the title
role and Johnny Depp as his sidekick Tonto, has collected $176
million in worldwide ticket revenue since its July 3 release,
according to Box Office Mojo, an industry website. Studios split
those receipts with theater owners and incur additional costs
marketing their pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cable, TV &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney's media networks, the company's
largest group, rose 8.2 percent to $2.3 billion. Growth in fees
from pay-TV services and advertising at networks, including
ESPN, countered higher programing costs and lower revenue from
the ABC broadcast business. Sales increased 5.3 percent to $5.35
billion, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs at the ABC network rose as the broadcast division
aired fewer shows made internally and acquired more programming
from outside producers, according to the statement. The ABC
network lost about 6 percent of its audience in the TV season
that ended in May and saw a 10 percent drop in the younger
viewers that advertisers target, according to Nielsen data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investments and an improving economy lifted profit at
Disney resorts and theme parks, where earnings increased 9.4
percent to $689 million on 7 percent higher attendance and more
spending by tourists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said projects such as MyMagic+, a wristband for
guests that serves as an admission ticket, room key and credit
card, led to higher costs. The Florida parks are benefiting from
the new Disney's Art of Animation resort and the expansion of
the Magic Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer products profit rose 4.8 percent to $219 million,
while losses at the company's interactive division increased to
$58 million from $42 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s 'Planes,' a low-cost animated feature that began life as a direct-to-DVD
project, is shaping up as a potential moneymaker for theaters in
a summer marked by slow sales for big-budget films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie, inspired by Pixar's 'Cars,' opens today. The
picture went from DVD-only to cinemas when Disney, the world's
largest entertainment company, saw how test audiences responded
to a rough cut, Dave Hollis, the studio's executive vice
president for sales and distribution, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It was off the charts,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced for about a fourth of what big budget movies cost,
'Planes' could generate $21 million this weekend and $81
million in its domestic run, according to Boxoffice.com.
Animated films typically do more outside the U.S., and Disney
already has 'Planes' toys and apparel in stores. The film was
made for about $50 million, according to a company official who
asked not to be named because the figure isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Planes' could be a surprise success because of its lower
price tag, according to David Weitzner, a movie marketing
consultant who teaches at the University of Southern
California's School of Cinematic Arts. 'The Lone Ranger,' a
July release from Burbank, California-based Disney, may lose as
much as $190 million, the company said on Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney executives 'see where the market is going, what
families are looking for, and are bringing it in at a price that
makes sense,' Weitzner said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DisneyToon Studios &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Planes' is about a cropdusting aircraft named Dusty with
a fear of heights and dreams of racing. It has a similar look
and feel as the two 'Cars' movies, from Disney's Pixar, which
have collected a combined $1 billion worldwide in ticket sales,
according to researcher Box Office Mojo. Comedian Dane Cook
supplies the voice for Dusty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Planes' was produced by DisneyToon Studios, a division
specializing in low-budget animated features mostly for home
video. 'The Jungle Book 2,' a $20 million theatrical release
from the division in 2003, had $135.7 million in worldwide
sales, according to Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Lasseter, who joined Disney as chief creative officer
of the animation studios following the company's acquisition of
Pixar in 2006, scaled back the unit's production after voicing
dissatisfaction with the quality of direct-to-home features.
DisneyToon Studios has been releasing about one movie a year,
down from six a decade ago, according to researcher IMDB.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Action Films &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing of 'Planes' may help, according to Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box-office division at market
researcher Hollywood.com. It comes on a weekend when other new
pictures are aimed at older theatergoers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'August can be the land of opportunity for movies that
aren't hardcore action films,' Dergarabedian said. 'It's sort
of like counter programming.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Elysium,' a science-fiction film from Sony Corp.
starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, also opens today. 'Percy
Jackson: Sea of Monsters,' based on a series of young-adult
novels, opened Aug. 7 and targets older kids than 'Planes'
because of its PG rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Planes' will compete with three animated films still in
theaters: 'The Smurfs 2,' in its second week, the hit film
'Despicable Me 2' in its sixth week, and 'Turbo,' in its
fourth week. The picture is opening in 3,700 theaters, according
to Hollywood.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Planes' Toys &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Cars' is among Disney's largest toy franchises,
generating more than $10 billion in retail sales since the first
picture's release in 2006, the company has said. Last year's
Cars Land addition to the company's California Adventure park in
Anaheim, California, led to a 23 percent jump in attendance,
according to the Themed Entertainment Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has already released 'Planes' related merchandise,
including $6 diecast airplanes, $13 story books and $18
children's jackets. A sequel, 'Planes: Fire  Rescue,' is
scheduled for theaters in July 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising and word-of-mouth from the theatrical release
could lead to higher sales of the DVD and merchandise tied to
the film, according to David Paiko, vice president of business
development at Rentrak Corp. (RENT), a media measurement firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'All those marketing dollars to promote it theatrically
puts an awareness into people's minds,' he said in an
interview. 'It's 'Cars' in the sky.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A London judge said HTC Corp. (2498)
couldn't sell its One Mini phone in the U.K. starting Dec. 6
after it was found to have infringed patents owned by Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Judge Richard Arnold also ruled that HTC's One phone
contained microchips that breached Nokia's patent, he delayed an
injunction against the product so HTC could appeal. Blocking
U.K. sales of the One would cause 'considerable' damage to
HTC, he said in a ruling today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC One, released globally including the U.K. in March, is
the Taiwanese company's flagship handset for 2013 and was lauded
by reviewers for its sleek metallic design. HTC One Mini and HTC
One Max, smaller and larger variants of the device, were
released in the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Nokia is also claiming financial compensation for the
infringement of this patent,' the Espoo, Finland-based company
said in a statement. HTC has agreed not to import any more of
the products into the U.K. pending the appeal, Nokia said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two calls and an e-mail to HTC public relations after
Taiwan office hours weren't immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTC had argued the microchips found to infringe Nokia
patents were 'a very small component' and didn't justify a
sales ban, Arnold said in the ruling. HTC sold about 750,000
smartphones worth about 221 million pounds ($363 million) in the
U.K. between January and September, according to the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia also sued Apple Inc. (AAPL) over the chip patent and settled
the case in April 2011 after agreeing to grant Apple a license.
In September, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to buy Nokia's devices and
services business for 5.44 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are HTC Corporation v. Nokia Corporation, High
Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, HC12A02048
and HC12C02909. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ParkerVision Requests Royalties, Ban on Qualcomm Chip Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ParkerVision Inc. (PRKR) asked a federal judge to order Qualcomm
Inc. (QCOM) to pay as much as 70 cents for each infringing mobile-phone
chip sold in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dec. 2 request follows a $173 million award a jury made
to ParkerVision in October in a patent lawsuit. The federal jury
in Orlando, Florida, rejected ParkerVision's argument that the
infringement was intentional. Had the jury found willfulness, it
would have allowed U.S. District Judge Roy Dalton to triple the
award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ParkerVision, which filed the infringement suit in July
2011, also asked for an order barring the sale of the disputed
chips. Qualcomm is seeking to have verdict overturned and
damages reduced.      The case is ParkerVision v. Qualcomm, 11-cv-00719, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida
(Jacksonville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disney Tells Australian Chip Shop to Forget About Frying Nemo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. told a fish-and-chips shop in a suburb of
Adelaide, Australia, to change its name or face a trademark-infringement action, the U.K.'s Drum magazine reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of Frying Nemo told the magazine that she had
consulted with a graphic design firm and that she thought the
image it used was sufficiently removed from the original -- seen
in Disney's 2003 'Finding Nemo' film --  to differentiate it
from the studio's intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said other businesses use the 'Frying Nemo' name
without being targeted by Burbank, California-based Disney,
according to Drum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Black Friday' Registered as 'Cyber Monday' Trademark Sought &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two shopping days after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday
known, respectively, as 'Black Friday' and 'Cyber Monday'
mark the beginning of the Christmas shopping season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American Philatelist reported 'Black Friday' was
first used by the Philadelphia Police Department to describe the
traffic jams that the shopping rush created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Cyber Monday' was created in 2005 by a unit of the
National Retail Federation to describe the surge on online
shopping that occurs the Monday after Thanksgiving, when many
workers order holiday gifts online after they've returned to
their offices following the holiday, according to the
association's website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several retailers and providers of advertising services
have either registered or sought to register the terms,
according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Wisconsin brewery registered 'Black Friday' as a
trademark in December 2012. Lakefront Brewery Inc. of Milwaukee
said in its filing that it began using the mark in November
2012, and that it would use the mark with beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second application for use of the term with advertising
and marketing services is pending. It was filed in September
2012 by a resident of Cleveland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Signature Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, registered 'A
Month of Black Fridays' in December 2012. That application
specified it's to be used for retail stores selling furniture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)'s Sears Brands Unit registered
'Better than Black Friday' in September 2010 for use with
retail department-store services. Also in retail, DealNews.com
Inc. registered 'dealnews Where every day is Black Friday' as
a trademark in March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although San Jose, California-based EBay Inc. (EBAY) filed two
applications in November 2008 to register 'Everyday is Black
Friday on eBay!!' the company abandoned both in November 2009.
According to patent office data, the applications were
considered abandoned in September 2009, for either failing to
respond to an office inquiry or responding too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only one 'Cyber Monday' trademark. It was
registered in August to a resident of Gilbert, Arizona, who said
in the application that the mark would be used for advertising
services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Time Warner Unit Turns Back Screenwriter's Infringement Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc. (TWX)'s Warner Bros. unit successfully
challenged a copyright-infringement lawsuit brought by a
Massachusetts writer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael P. Kenney and his Shamrock Films sued the studio in
federal court in Boston April 30, claiming that its film
'Ghostman' infringes the copyright to his 'Ghostman,'
currently in post-production editing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court said Nov. 29 that Kenney was unable to prove
Warner Bros. had access to the script on which his film was
based or that there was a 'substantial similarity' between the
two works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to court papers, Kenney's film is based on his
comic-book hero Ghostman, 'a masked thief who seeks to avoid
the FBI by using ghost-like abilities.' The Warner Bros.
project is based on Roger Hobbs's novel 'Ghostman,' to which
the studio acquired the rights, the court said in its ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elements that Kenney claimed are infringed, such as
plots, subplots or themes, aren't protectable under U.S.
copyright law, the court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kenney v. Warner Brothers Entertainment Inc.,
13-cv-11068, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Youku Tudou Wins China Copyright Infringement Suit Against Baidu &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU), the Beijing-based provider of streaming
video, prevailed in a copyright infringement lawsuit against the
Chinese search engine company Baidu Inc. (BIDU), China Radio
International's English-language website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baidu was accused of broadcasting 18 Chinese television
programs to which Youku had exclusive rights, according to CRI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search-engine company was ordered to pay 481,000 yuan
($80,600) by the Haidian District People's Court in Beijing, CRI
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ruling comes after infringement accusations made
against Baidu Nov. 13 by the Motion Picture Association of
America, several Chinese online video services and other content
owners, according to CRI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copyright Agency in Australia Says Costs Are Justified &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia's Copyright Agency said the A$16.5 million ($15.1
million) in costs levied against the A$121.5 million it
collected in royalties are justifiable, according to the
Australian newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandy Grant, who leads the agency, told the Australian that
its fees are cheaper than most other collection agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government departments, schools and universities account
for about 85 percent of the revenue the agency collects,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dairy-Equipment Company Awarded $22.7 Million in Secrets Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Minnesota state court jury awarded a dairy-equipment
company $22.7 million in a trade-secrets case against former
employees, according to a statement from the company's counsel,
Gray Plant Mooty PA of Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relco LLC of Willmar, Minnesota, sued the former employees
in May 2011, alleging they took confidential information to
their new jobs at Custom Fabricating  Repair Inc. of
Marshfield, Wisconsin, and violated terms of their employment
agreement with Relco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom Fabricating will be responsible for 90 percent of
the damages award, according to the statement. Custom
Fabricating didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for confirmation of the damages award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Relco LLC v. A. Kent Keller Technologies Inc.,
34-cv-11-396, Minnesota 8th Judicial District, Kandiyohi County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) may quickly enlarge
its Shanghai resort after it opens in late 2015 in order to meet
rising demand in the world's most populous country, Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Disney Resort will be almost 1,000 acres (404.7
hectares) in size when it opens, putting it third behind Walt
Disney World in Orlando, Florida, and Disneyland Paris among the
company's resorts, Rasulo said at the UBS Global Media and
Communications Conference in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We're opening the park for a pretty healthy number of
attendees but more importantly both we and our partners and the
Shanghai government are eager and willing to expand rapidly
after that,' Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance could ultimately top the company's second-most
popular property, Tokyo Disney Resort, which has 28 million
annual visitors, Rasulo said, reiterating remarks he made in
September. Disney, the world's largest theme park operator, is
building a 29 billion-yuan ($4.78 billion) resort in Shanghai
that will include two hotels and an outdoor recreational area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based company owns 43 percent of
the venture with the state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group Co., a
consortium of three businesses, holding the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resort is part of a larger focus by Disney on China,
where entertainment spending by consumers has lagged the growth
of the middle class, Rasulo said. The new park is within a
three-hour drive of 330 million people, many of them young
families, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Attractions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney in the past four years invested in new attractions
at its Hong Kong resort, where business is now 'growing in
leaps and bounds,' Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said last month that its capital expenditures
in its current 2014 fiscal year may be about $1 billion higher
than 2013 due to the investment in the Shanghai park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Disney announced its first corporate sponsor of
the new park. Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. will
feature its brand in the Garden of the Twelve Friends, part of
an 11-acre compound at the center of the park where each animal
of the Chinese Zodiac will be represented by a Disney or Pixar
character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We believe we're developing a park that will absolutely
blow people away,' Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney rose 0.6 percent to $71.57 at the close in
New York yesterday. The stock has gained 44 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring Las Vegas-style gambling to
Florida, casino operators like Sheldon Adelson are sending more
than 100 lobbyists to the state Capitol to battle their biggest
adversary: Mickey Mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clash pits casino operators Genting Bhd. (GENT) and Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS), controlled by billionaire Adelson, against Walt
Disney Co. (DIS), which runs theme parks and resorts near Orlando, and
may face new competition for convention business. Companies on
both sides of the dispute are sending lobbyists and campaign
checks to Florida lawmakers, who say they'll consider expanding
gambling this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state-commissioned study found that full-service casinos
and their associated hotels could generate $1.5 billion in
spending annually in Florida, making the fourth-most populous
state an attractive target for the gambling industry as it
pushes to expand in the U.S. The outcome is critical for Disney,
as the world's largest entertainment company seeks to protect
its Walt Disney World Resort, which includes theme parks and
five convention facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Gambling interests in Las Vegas and Atlantic City are
looking for new territory, and opening Florida to them would be
tremendous,' said Robert Jarvis, who teaches gambling law at
Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale. 'The fear for
Disney is that instead of people going to Disney and dropping
their disposable income there, they'll go to the destination
casinos and drop their money there.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX), adding to its growing
role in kids' online videos, obtained exclusive streaming rights
to an animated TV series based on George Lucas's 'Star Wars'
movies from Walt Disney Co., including the new final season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Canadian subscribers will be able to view the 13-episode sixth season of 'Star Wars: the Clone Wars' beginning
March 7, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said today in a
statement. The series ran for five seasons on Time Warner Inc.'s
Cartoon Network, according to the Star Wars website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Star Wars' is one of the most iconic franchises of all
time, and this series joins a long line of Disney content that
Netflix members are and will continue to enjoy for years to
come,' Ted Sarandos, the streaming-video company's chief
content officer, said in the statement. 'The 'Clone Wars' marks
an important moment as Netflix welcomes more and more first-run
content from the Walt Disney Co. and its subsidiaries.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix is focusing on delivering a mix of exclusive TV
shows and movies, including children's fare, as it battles
Amazon.com Inc., the largest online retailer, and Hulu LLC for
online viewers. The company has exclusive deals with both Disney
and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland (DIS) plans to open
its third and largest hotel by early 2017 to accommodate an
influx of visitors from countries including China and South
Korea amid intensifying competition from a local theme park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 750-room hotel will cost HK$4.26 billion ($550
million), the company said in a statement today. Hong Kong
Disneyland posted a profit of HK$242 million, its second annual
gain, in the 12 months ended September, more than double the
HK$109 million a year ago, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors from China to Hong Kong Disneyland, part-owned by
the city's government, jumped 15 percent last year, while those
from South Korea surged 27 percent, Hong Kong Disneyland
Managing Director Andrew Kam told reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The hotel expansion will support increasing demand from
the booming tourism industry in the region,' Kam said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland, 48-percent owned by Burbank,
California-based Walt Disney Co., will create an area that
features Marvel characters in late 2016 after new attractions
including Toy Story and Grizzly Gulch helped it turn a first
profit in fiscal 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland's sales rose 15 percent to HK$4.9
billion for the fiscal year, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme park has had to contend with government-owned
Ocean Park, which drew 7.7 million visitors in the fiscal year
ended June. Ocean Park plans to add around 30 attractions by
2017 and a 495-room hotel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visitors from China to the former British colony jumped
16.7 percent to 40.8 million last year and accounted for 75
percent of total visitor arrivals, according to the Hong Kong
Tourism Board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) started an online
movie service, Disney Movies Anywhere, with Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iTunes
to increase sales of films such as 'Toy Story' that can be
stored in Web-based accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movies can be played on Apple's iPad, iPhone and iPod
Touch, as well as through the Internet, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a statement. Users will be able to
link to iTunes and import films they've previously purchased
there to Disney Movies Anywhere accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The service underscores a longstanding TV and film alliance
between Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, and
Apple. Disney's ABC television programs were the first to appear
on iTunes in 2005, and former Apple Chief Executive Officer
Steve Jobs sat on Disney's board. Both companies stayed out of a
movie-industry initiative called Ultraviolet, meant to let users
buy movies from any studio or retailer and store them in a
cloud-based library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Disney Movies Anywhere could stabilize Disney's home-entertainment business, which has experienced lower results for
five consecutive years,' Drew Crum, an analyst with Stifel
Nicolaus  Co., said in a report. He recommends buying Disney
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.6 percent to $80.21 at the close in New York.
The shares have advanced 5 percent in 2014, while the Standard 
Poor's 500 Index is little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movie studios have been struggling with a decline in DVD
sales since the mid-2000s, when home-video revenue accounted for
more than two-thirds of film-industry sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing Habits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audiences at home have turned to subscription services such
as Netflix Inc., or one-time movie rentals, available on iTunes,
Amazon.com, or through their pay-TV provider. These transactions
provide smaller profit margins to the studios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of DVD and Blu-ray discs fell 8.1 percent to $7.8
billion in the U.S. last year, according to the industry's
Digital Entertainment Group, while electronic sales advanced 47
percent to $1.19 billion. Total sales declined 3.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subscription streaming advanced 32 percent to $3.16
billion. Total home-video spending increased 0.7 percent to
$18.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Marvel announced
plans to film four television programs and a miniseries in New
York as part of its plans to create shows for Netflix Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans were announced today by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo
and Robert Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer.
Filming is set to start later this year and will create at least
3,000 jobs in the state, including as many as 400 full-time
positions, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will include almost 60 one-hour episodes
focused on the 4 Defenders characters: Daredevil, Jessica Jones,
Luke Cage and Iron Fist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will film a live-action series for Netflix Inc. (NFLX) with Marvel superheroes in New
York City, the biggest production commitment in state history,
Governor Andrew Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuomo, who announced the deal today in Manhattan, is
providing incentives valued at about $4 million, said an aide,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details
aren't public. In November, Disney agreed to create four
television series for Netflix using Marvel characters such as
Daredevil, adding to the online-streaming video service's
growing lineup of orginal content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'New York is where the entertainment industry started, and
this unprecedented commitment from Disney and Marvel is further
evidence that we're bringing it back bigger and better than ever
before,' Cuomo said in an e-mailed statement. 'The competition
for these projects is fierce.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's Marvel TV will start bringing the shows to Netflix
in 2015, according to a November statement. They will focus on
heroes battling villains in New York's Hell's Kitchen. Netflix
committed to a minimum of four 13-episode series, culminating in
the miniseries 'The Defenders.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is gaining more
Disney content following an agreement in 2012 for rights to show
movies including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Our Marvel series for Netflix will inject millions
directly into the local economy and create hundreds of new
jobs,' said Robert Iger, chief executive officer of Burbank,
California-based Disney, in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ), the bankrupt
photography company, was sued by Japan's Kyocera Corp. (6971) for
allegedly infringing more than a dozen U.S. patents with its
printers and digital cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, will cause
'irreparable harm' to Kyoto-based Kyocera if the infringement
isn't stopped, plaintiff's lawyers said in a complaint filed
Dec. 4 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kyocera is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages
from Kodak, which has been trying to sell some of its own
patents to pay creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kodak sought bankruptcy protection in January 2012, citing
$5.1 billion in assets and $6.75 billion in debt, as the
transition to digital photography eroded the company's film-
based business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Veronda, a Kodak spokesman, didn't immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Seeks U.S. Patent on Computer Game Controller With Lens &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has filed an application for a patent
on a gaming console that can use images from everyday reality
and allow a user to manipulate and animate those images. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application 20130002698, published in the database of the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 3, covers what Disney
calls 'virtual lens-rendering for augmented reality lens.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application noted that while some game devices already
capture images from outside the game, the colors shown on the
screen may not match up with the actual object. While some
devices can allow the user to make adjustments so the image more
closely aligns with the object, these adjustments may produce
'an unrealistic display' in other environments.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney applied for the patent in
June 2011. CNet News reported Jan. 4 that the technology
described in the patent application may be related to the
forthcoming Toy Box console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;USPTO Seeks Public Input on Improvement of Software Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will hold two public
meetings aimed at the improvement of software patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a notice published Jan. 3 in the Federal
Register, roundtable meetings will be held in California and New
York in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford University is the site of the Feb. 12 meeting, and
the New York event will be held at New York University Feb. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the topics under discussion is the establishment of
clear boundaries for patent claims that use functional language.
Another subject is the office's request for comments on the
preparation of patent applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office is also seeking input on topics for future
discussions related to software patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attendees at both events will have opportunity to
provide input, the office said group-consensus advice won't be
sought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advance registration may be made by sending an e-mail to
softwareroundtable2013@USPTO.gov. Applicants should specify
name, title, applicable company or organization, address, phone
number and e-mail address, and which presentation they wish to
attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who wish to make a presentation should send final
electronic copies of their remarks to the same address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential attendees are asked to register by Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'Scottish Wild Salmon' Now a Protected Name Indicator in EU &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Scottish Wild Salmon' is now a protected geographic name
indicator in the European Union, according to a December
publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the term to describe either non-wild salmon or
salmon from outside the specific geographic area was barred
beginning Dec. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Salmon Net Fishing Association of Scotland is the
organization that had sought the designation, Scotland's
Montrose Review reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Aberdeen, Scotland-based association's
website, all rights of salmon fishing in that country are held
as private titles that can be inherited, regardless of whether
the fishing is done in fresh water or in the sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 107-year-old association's membership is comprised of
owners and lessees of salmon fisheries on the east coast of
Scotland, and is Scotland's oldest fishermen's organization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apple Fined in Beijing Court for Infringing Writers Copyrights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), the maker of the iPhone and iPod, must pay 1.03
million Chinese yuan ($165,300) in a Chinese copyright case,
XinHua's English language news reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling came from Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's
Court, which found that Cupertino, California-based Apple had
violated the copyrights of eight Chinese writers and two
companies, XinHua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suits were related to alleged unlicensed electronic
versions of books sold as downloads by Apple, according to
XinHua. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge against Apple was violation of the writers
'right of communication through information networks,' XinHua
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DC Comics' 'Batmobile' Case Set for Jan. 30 Motion Hearing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 30 in the copyright-
infringement case Time Warner Inc. (TWX)'s DC Comics unit brought
against a builder of custom autos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Comics sued Mark Towle of Santa Ana, California, in
federal court in Los Angeles in March 2011, claiming he
infringed copyrights by producing replica Batmobiles through his
Gotham Garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court will hear both sides' presentations on motions
for dismissal of the case, according to a Dec. 26 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That document specifies that Towle has made and distributed
copies of the Batmobile seen in the 1996 'Batman' television
series, and car kits with which others could also reconfigure
their cars to resemble the Batmobile. Towel didn't stipulate
that his replicas contained all the 'separable, non-functional,
artistic elements' that DC Comics contends it owns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement specifies that all the stipulations the
parties made in that document are valid only in connection with
the motion for dismissal of the case. Should the case go forward
beyond that point, the stipulations would have 'no force and
effect,' according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is DC Comics v. Mart Towle, 2:11-cv-03934-RSWL-OP,
U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los
Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdero's Starfire, Extreme Environment Materials Settle Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verdero Capital LLC's Starfire Systems said in a Jan. 3
statement that it has resolved a trade-secret and trademark-
infringement case against Extreme Environment Materials
Solutions unit and two former Starfire employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Starfire engineers polymer-based ceramic
components for its customers. They are used in armor, aerospace
and electronics. The company sued Extreme Environment and the
ex-employees in federal court in Syracuse, New York, in July
2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a Dec. 21 court filing, all the defendants are
permanently barred from developing , manufacturing, purchasing,
selling or brokering products based on a process outlined in
some 'highly confidential' Starfire documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also barred from using Starfire's trademarks as a
name for or description of any products not made by Starfire.
They must also discontinue use of the 'Starfire.co' Internet
domain name, and from any involvement with any other domain name
that directly or indirectly contains the terms 'Starfire' or
'Starfire Systems.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No financial terms were mentioned in this court filing,
which specified that all claims and defenses are now dismissed
and parties had to pay their own litigation costs and attorney
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Starfire Systems Inc. v. Extreme Environment
Materials Solutions LLC, 1:11-cv-00888-GLS-CFH, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of New York (Syracuse). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Greg Stohr and Edmund Lee" datetime="Jan 09, 2014 12:00 AM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-09/disney-fox-bid-to-end-web-tv-threat-nears-court-action.html"><headline>Disney and Fox Near Showdown With Aereo at Top Court</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Major broadcasters are heading for a
showdown in their bid to block a Barry Diller-backed company
from upending the industry's economics by offering subscribers
live television over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court will say as soon as tomorrow whether
it will consider the claim by companies including Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)'s ABC and 21st Century Fox Inc. (FOX) that Aereo Inc.'s business
is built on copyright violations, obtaining broadcast signals
for free and distributing them for a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides in the dispute are seeking a high court hearing,
increasing the chances the justices will step in. If so, the
case will determine the fate of Aereo, a startup that threatens
the billions of dollars in retransmission fees broadcasters get
from pay-TV systems that provide signals to subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's nothing short of a watershed moment,' said David Bank, a media analyst with RBC Capital Markets. 'If the Supreme
Court agrees to hear it, we're going to finally resolve the
issue.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn't violating broadcasters'
copyrights. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) are
joining Disney and Fox in urging reversal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision to take up the case this month would mean a
Supreme Court ruling by early July. The justices could also ask
the Obama administration for input, a step that would delay a
resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retransmission Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retransmission fees have become increasingly important for
broadcast networks, supplementing advertising revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters are expected to reap more than $4.29 billion
in fees paid by satellite and cable companies this year, a 30
percent gain from last year, according to research firm SNL
Kagan. That revenue is projected to reach $7.15 billion by 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fox and CBS have said they may abandon their broadcast
signals and become cable networks if Aereo continues unabated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We need to be able to be fairly compensated for our
content,' 21st Century Fox President and Chief Operating
Officer Chase Carey said at an industry conference last year.
'We can't sit idly by and let an entity steal our signal. We
will move to a subscription model if that's our only recourse.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversion to a cable network would mean that broadcast
signals would no longer be freely available over the airwaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cable Switch &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should broadcasters make the switch, it would affect about
12 percent of households, according to estimates based on data
from SNL Kagan and Nielsen. About 100 million of 114 million
U.S. homes with televisions subscribe to pay-TV services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diller, the billionaire investor who helped create the Fox
network, says New York-based Aereo may eventually get as much as
35 percent of U.S. households to subscribe if it overcomes legal
challenges. The service charges customers $8 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DirecTV, Time Warner Cable Inc. and Charter Communications
Inc. are considering using the same approach, capturing free
broadcast-TV signals to avoid paying retransmission fees,
according to people with knowledge of the companies' plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable companies could use Aereo's approach in an effort
to bypass or reduce the fees they now pay, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court fight centers on a provision in the federal
copyright law that gives owners the exclusive right to perform
their works 'publicly.' The appeals court said Aereo's service
was legal because the separate antennas let each customer create
a distinct copy of a broadcast program for viewing, so no public
transmission was taking place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Technical Detail' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broadcasters argued in their appeal that Aereo is
trying to use a 'technical detail' to circumvent well-established legal rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There is no dispute that Aereo has developed a business
model around the massive, for-profit exploitation of the
copyrighted works of others,' the broadcasters argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aereo is taking the unusual step of encouraging Supreme
Court review of a ruling in the company's favor, saying it wants
to resolve legal doubt. That stems in part from rulings by two
federal trial judges declaring another company's similar system
to be a copyright violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation has 'created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo's efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business,' the company told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chet Kanojia, chief executive officer of Aereo, told
Bloomberg Television yesterday that 'it will become clear what
the road map looks like on the legal front over the next few
months' if the Supreme Court takes up the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFL Backing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower court disagreement often prompts the high court to
consider a case, though the justices tend to wait until the same
issue has been decided differently at the appeals court level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Football League and Major League Baseball,
whose games appear on broadcast TV, are backing the media
companies. The broadcasters also have support at the high court
from companies that produce television programs, including Time
Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) is taking a middle ground in the
debate, saying that while Aereo's service violates the copyright
laws, the broadcasters' arguments go too far and threaten
legitimate services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local TV broadcast industry is run separately from the
national networks and would face a different challenge if Aereo
is found to be legal. Local broadcasters act as affiliates of
the national networks and negotiate separate deals with pay-TV
operators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidating Business &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local broadcasters have consolidated in the last few years,
a move partly spurred by the growth in retransmission revenue as
well as the value of their broadcasting bandwidth, also known as
spectrum, parts of which could be sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation led to more than $10 billion in acquisitions
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Aereo's
legality could threaten the value of those deals, according to
Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's super-complicated from an investor perspective,' he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is American Broadcasting Companies
v. Aereo, 13-461. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) didn't infringe a patent
owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Motorola Mobility unit over mobile-phone
technology, a U.S. appeals court ruled Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling, posted on the website of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, affirms a victory
Apple won at the U.S. International Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility had unsuccessfully claimed Apple
infringed six patents in a case before the ITC. The sole patent
on appeal involves a way to control the delivery of data to
applications on a wireless device. The three-judge panel of the
Federal Circuit said the commission was correct to rule that
Cupertino, California-based Apple used a different technique. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, inherited the
case when it bought Motorola Mobility in 2012 for $12.4 billion.
The purchase was made in part to get Motorola Mobility's trove
of more than 17,000 patents, which Google hoped would be used to
counter attacks that its Android operating system was infringing
Apple and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) patents. Thus far, the strategy hasn't
resulted in a significant legal victory against either company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent in this case also has been asserted against
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Motorola Mobility LLC. V. U.S. International
Trade Commission, 13-1666, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain
Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data
Processing Devices, Computers and Components Thereof, 337-745,
U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technology Patent Case Accepted by Top Court at Google's Urging &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review a patent ruling
that Google Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) say threatens to open
information-technology companies to new infringement lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices on Jan. 10 said they will hear an appeal by
Limelight Networks Inc., which is fighting a suit by Akamai
Technologies Inc. (AKAM) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
over Akamai's patented method for redirecting requests for
Internet content to ensure access during periods of high demand.
The companies compete with one another in that field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court said Akamai could sue Limelight
even though no single company performed every aspect of the
patented method. Akamai says Limelight takes all but one step
and induces its customers to perform the final step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
specializes in patent cases, ruled that Limelight could be sued
for inducing infringement. The ruling marked a change for the
Washington-based court, which had previously barred such suits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Cisco, Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Red Hat Inc. (RHT), Symantec Corp. (SYMC)
and Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) are backing Limelight, which is based in Tempe,
Arizona. Those companies said in a court filing that the
decision would leave technology companies vulnerable because
products like smartphones 'can be used in an almost infinite
combination of ways by other companies and consumers.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration also urged the nation's highest
court to intervene and rule for Limelight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told
the Supreme Court it shouldn't hear the case. The company said
the rule overturned by the Federal Circuit allowed circumvention
of patents 'in the form of contrived 'non-infringing' multiple-actor scenarios.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court is already preparing to consider another
technology patenting case in its current term, which runs
through June. In that case, the court will decide when software
can be patented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akamai won a $45.5 million jury award at an earlier stage
in the litigation. In a separate part of its ruling, the Federal
Circuit said a trial judge was correct to set aside that award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Pfizer
Inc. sided with Akamai at the appeals court level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Limelight Networks v. Akamai Technologies,
12-786. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Daiichi Sankyo Wins Dismissal of Apotex Suit Over Drug Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daiichi Sankyo Co. won dismissal of an Apotex Inc. lawsuit
that sought a court finding that its plan to market a generic
form of the blood pressure drug Benicar didn't infringe a
Daiichi-held patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in Chicago said
that because Daiichi had disclaimed the patent over which Apotex
sued, there was no legal controversy over which she could rule.
Her decision was released Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotex sued Tokyo-based Daiichi in 2012. A finding of non-infringement would have enabled it to compete sooner with
generic drug maker Mylan Inc., which also plans to bring a form
of Benicar to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Daiichi disclaimed the patent and in 2006 asked the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to de-list it, the agency
never acted on that request, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Apotex Inc. v. Daiichi Sankyo, 12-cv-9295, U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broadcasters Get U.S. Supreme Court Review in Bid to Stop Aereo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters will get a U.S. Supreme Court hearing in their
fight to stop Aereo Inc., the company that is threatening the
industry's decades-old business model by selling live television
programming over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices on Dec. 10 agreed to hear an appeal by media
companies including Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ABC, 21st Century Fox
Inc. (FOX), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) They contend
that Aereo, which is backed by Barry Diller, is violating their
copyrights by using thousands of dime-sized antennas to obtain
broadcast signals without paying fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn't violating broadcasters'
copyrights. Broadcasters say the ruling created a blueprint that
might let cable and satellite providers avoid paying
'retransmission' fees to carry programming. With those fees
estimated to exceed $4 billion this year, some broadcast
companies say they may convert to cable channels if Aereo isn't
shut down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court decision 'is already transforming the
industry and threatening the very fundamentals of broadcast
television,' the broadcasters argued in their appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aereo joined the broadcasters in urging Supreme Court
review, saying the company needs legal clarity so it can pursue
plans for growth. In separate cases, two federal trial judges
ruled that another company's similar system was a copyright
violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation has 'created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo's efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business,' the New York-based company told the court. Aereo,
which offers service in 10 cities, said Jan. 8 that it has
raised $34 million to fund expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under its normal scheduling practices, the Supreme Court
will hear arguments in April and rule by early July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo,
13-461. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dow Jones Accuses Ransquawk of Misappropriating Its News &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA)'s Dow Jones  Co., the publisher of the Wall
Street Journal, accused the Ransquawk financial news aggregation
service of illegally redistributing news from its DJX subscriber
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-Time Analysis  News Ltd., Ransquawk's U.K.-based
owner, republishes on its website and through audio broadcasts
Dow Jones's news headlines within seconds after they appear on
DJX, according to the complaint filed Jan. 9 in federal court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Because Ransquawk distributes news copied verbatim from
DJX in competition with DJX without incurring the costs Dow
Jones incurs to originate the news, Ransquawk is able to offer
its products and services at a substantially lower price than
Dow Jones can offer similar products and services,' according
to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company seeks at least $5 million in damages for
misappropriation of 'hot news' as well as for interfering with
contractual relationships by obtaining the news without a DJX
subscription, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of Real-Time Analysis  News didn't
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Dow Jones in providing financial news and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dow Jones  Co. v. Real-Time Analysis  News

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects software sales decline in 10th paragraph of
story published on Jan. 15.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), working to improve
results at its interactive division, unveiled a video-game
system that reduces development costs by incorporating
characters from multiple movies in the same game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infinity platform includes a base unit that connects to
computers and game consoles, Burbank, California-based Disney
said today in a statement. Plastic figures set on top of the
unit appear on screen in games. The company will sell the
figures, as well as discs that add scenery and features. A
starter kit with the base and three figures is priced at $75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Infinity, Disney will be able to add content without
developing new games from scratch each time a film comes out,
according to John Pleasants, co-president of Disney interactive.
That's critical for a division Disney Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger has said will be profitable in
2013 after losses of $1.6 billion in the past six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's something we expect to be able to live on for years,
and we can continuously add to it,' Pleasants said in an
interview. 'It's not just a game that we're shipping.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasants, who joined Disney with the acquisition of
social-game maker Playdom in 2010, urged his designers to
'think big' in developing the system, according to John Blackburn, vice president of Disney's Avalanche Software unit in
Salt Lake City, Utah, which oversaw the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Player Freedom &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinity is Disney's largest game project in terms of the
cost and characters involved, Blackburn said, without giving
specifics on the finances. The initial release will involve 20
Disney and Pixar characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventures within Infinity leave a lot to the player, the
executives said. Captain Jack Sparrow, from the 'Pirates of the
Caribbean' films, could go on missions with Buzz Lightyear, one
of the 'Toy Story' characters, while riding in Cinderella's
coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's like your parent's living room floor, where nobody
told you what to do with your toys,' John Vignocchi, an
executive producer of the game, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining collectible figures with video-game play, the
Infinity platform, which goes on sale in June, is similar to
Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)'s 'Skylanders' games, which generated
$500 million in sales of games and related merchandise last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pirates Games &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is changing direction as sales of traditional video
games have fallen. Video-game software sales declined 23 percent
to $6.71 billion in 2012, NPD said. Disney released six titles
for consoles last year, down from 23 in 2010, according to the
company and VGChartz.com, a research site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its products have sometimes disappointed consumers. A group
called Revive Potco gathered 2,000 signatures asking Disney to
invest more in its Pirates of the Caribbean game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Phillips, who follows the business on a blog called In
the Life of Nerd, was critical of that game and another called
'World of Cars,' tied to the popular Pixar films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It was a terrible waste of the Cars brand and one that
was likely designed and rushed out in an attempt to profit from
the movies,' Phillips wrote last February, the same month
Disney shut it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Lasseter, chief creative officer for Disney animation
studios, also thought some movie-themed games lacked substance,
according to Blackburn. He was reluctant to include Pixar
content in Infinity until the game makers showed him designs
where the disparate characters shared a common look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Challenges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney gained 1 percent to $51.09 at the close in New York.
The shares advanced 33 percent in 2012, compared with 13 percent
for the SP 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Gerbrandt, a long-time media analyst now with Media
Valuation Partners in Los Angeles, said he is skeptical the
interactive unit can ever produce the consistent earnings of
Disney's cable TV and theme-park businesses. He pointed to
challenges facing Zynga Inc. (ZNGA), the social game leader, which has
fallen 74 percent since it first sold shares in December 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's a very streaky business,' Gerbrandt said. 'All you
have to do is look at Zynga to see how hard it is to create hits
and come up with sequels. If they could be happy with the Disney
website, they'd be fine. It's when they move beyond that they
run into problems.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasants, co-president of the unit, disagrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Profitability is a goal for this division for sure, for
this year, for the future, for beyond,' he said. 'We are very,
very focused on that. We are growing nicely.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Iger, chairman and chief
executive officer of Walt Disney Co. (DIS), collected $40.2 million in
total compensation last fiscal year, based on regulatory
reporting rules, a 20 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger's pay included $2.5 million in salary, $9.53 million
in stock awards, $7.75 million in option awards and a bonus of
$16.5 million, according a regulatory filing today. A change in
the value of his pension plan and other compensation added
almost $4 million more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase came in a fiscal year when shares of Burbank,
California-based Disney returned 76 percent including dividends,
compared with 30 percent for the SP 500 index. Iger, 61, also
took on the added role of chairman. Walt Disney's profit rose 18
percent to $5.68 billion in the year ended Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, will
hold its annual meeting March 6 in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year's meeting 57 percent of shareholders supported
the company's executive pay plan, down from 77 percent the year
before. In today's filing, Disney said the vote 'fell below our
expectations.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company reconfigured its bonus terms after management
and the chairwoman of the compensation committee met with the
largest shareholders, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the previous plan allowed management to collect 100
percent of their bonuses even if shareholder returns were weak,
the new plan bases awards equally on stock performance and
earnings, according to the filing. The company said 92 percent
of Iger's targeted compensation is performance based. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds is proposing at
the annual meeting that investors vote to split the chairman and
CEO roles in the future, according to today's filing. Disney's
board opposes that plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.1 percent to $52.34 at the close in New York.
It has gained 5.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is closing Junction
Point Studios, the maker of the 'Epic Mickey' video games, as
the world's largest media company works to boost results in its
money-losing interactive division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Disney declined to say how many jobs were
eliminated by shuttering the Austin, Texas-based studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is
restructuring the company's interactive division, which designs
games and websites, and has said it will be profitable in 2013
after six years of losses totaling $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, Burbank, California-based Disney unveiled a new
game platform called Infinity that is designed to reduce some of
the cost in releasing new games. Characters and storylines from
new Disney movies can be added to the Infinity system without
all of the expense of developing games from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junction Point, founded by game designer Warren Spector,
designed the 2010 'Epic Mickey' game, a merger of current
video-game technology with classic Disney characters that sold
2.6 million copies. Last year's sequel, 'Epic Mickey 2,' has
sold 529,000, according to market researcher NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It was with much sadness that we informed our teams today
of changes to our games organization, which include the closure
of Junction Point Studios,' Disney said in a statement. 'These
changes are part of our ongoing effort to address the fast-
evolving gaming platforms and marketplace and to align resources
against our key priorities.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell 0.7 percent to $53.96 at 2:39 p.m. in New
York. Disney rose 33 percent last year compared with a 13
percent gain for the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost-cutting comes as sales of games for consoles such
as Sony Corp.'s (SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Xbox are in
decline. Video-game software sales fell 23 percent to $6.7
billion in 2012, according to NPD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney once operated six video games studios, three of
which have now been closed in the past three years. The company
added another with the acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd., which was
completed in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Junction Point closure was first reported by
Forbes.com. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is close to a
programming agreement that would settle litigation over Dish
Network Corp. (DISH)'s ad-skipping technology, according to two people
with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, could
receive compensation for technology, known as AutoHop, that lets
Dish subscribers skip commercials in broadcast shows they have
recorded, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolution of the dispute with Dish, the second-largest
U.S. satellite TV service, could make ad-skipping a regular
feature of TV viewing, and ease the tension between Dish and
other programmers. The company is also involved in litigation
with CBS Corp., Comcast Corp.'s NBC and 21st Century Fox Inc.'s
Fox over the feature, which threatens to undermine the
effectiveness of network ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions to settle the ad-skipping litigation are part
of wider contract talks between Burbank, California-based Disney
and Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, for future rights to
programming from ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel. An existing
accord between the parties expired in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By agreeing to let Dish customers skip ads on ABC network
programs they have recorded, Disney could receive higher monthly
subscriber fees, the people said. Broadcast networks have been
asking pay-TV providers for compensation for their over-the-air
programming, similar to what they get for their cable networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retransmission Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney has said such fees could bring in as much as $500
million annually by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AutoHop technology, introduced by Dish in May 2012,
lets the company's satellite-TV customers skip commercials on
recorded broadcast TV shows. The company had 14 million U.S.
subscribers as of the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish is working with TV networks to deliver more targeted
ads based on consumer information collected by set-top boxes,
Warren Schlichting, the company's senior vice president of media
sales and analytics, said in an interview in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.2 percent to $73.11 at 2:25 p.m. in New York.
The stock rose 53 percent last year. Dish gained 0.2 percent to
$56.60 and gained 59 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the owner of Marvel Entertainment, acquired the rights to four Marvel superhero movies held by Viacom Inc. (VIAB)'s Paramount Pictures, the studio that released the films from 2008 to 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement covers the first two 'Iron Man' movies, 'Thor' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger,' according to a statement today from Burbank, California-based Disney and Los Angeles-based Paramount. Terms weren't given. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal gives Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, more control over Marvel's film library as it seeks to expand those characters into television shows and theme-park attractions. Disney acquired the comic book and movie company in December 2009 for $4.2 billion in cash and stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney later purchased the distribution and marketing rights to 2012's 'Marvel's The Avengers' and this year's 'Iron Man 3.' Both were held by Paramount. Disney paid Paramount at least $115 million at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Marvel's The Avengers' was the top-grossing film last year, with $1.5 billion in worldwide ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo, an industry researcher. 'Iron Man 3' leads this year with $1.2 billion in worldwide box office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp (SNE). makes 'Spider-Man' movies under a longstanding agreement with Marvel. Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said in a May 22 interview with the fan website Ain't it Cool News, that the studio had no intention of selling Spider-Man rights. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;21st Century Fox has made the 'X-Men' and 'Wolverine' films under a similar arrangement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.1 percent to $63.26 at the close in New York. The stock is up 27 percent this year. Viacom, based in New York, declined 0.4 percent to $67.54 and is up 28 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri and Michael White" datetime="Jul 02, 2013  4:36 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-02/disney-rides-into-box-office-ambush-with-depp-s-lone-ranger-.html"><headline>Disney Rides Into Box-Office Ambush With 'The Lone Ranger'</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Johnny Depp's 'The Lone Ranger,' opening in theaters tomorrow to negative reviews and tough competition, looks poised to become Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s biggest flop since last year's $200 million loss from 'John Carter.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie, based on the 1930s radio show and 1950s TV series, is the type of project that's worked well in Hollywood of late. It features well-known characters and a proven star in Depp, with potential for sequels and merchandise sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Disney will struggle to turn a profit, after the budget climbed to $225 million and the film earned mostly unfavorable early reviews. The task is more challenging because 'The Lone Ranger' opens on a competitive summer weekend, against Universal Pictures' animated 'Despicable Me 2' and holdovers that include 'Monsters University,' from Disney's Pixar, and the zombie thriller 'World War Z.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It is a huge gamble,' said Doug Creutz, an analyst with Cowen  Co. in San Francisco, who predicts a $100 million write-off for Disney. 'You need the film to be really good.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics have been harsh. Of 62 reviews compiled by the website Rottentomatoes.com, 79 percent were labeled negative. That compares with 49 percent 'rotten' out of 218 reviews of 'John Carter,' Disney's March 2012 sci-fi fantasy about a Civil War veteran transported to Mars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) extended Robert Iger's tenure as chief executive officer of the world's largest
entertainment company to June 2016, a move that delays his
planned succession for 15 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 62, will now continue in both the chairman and CEO
positions until mid-2016, Burbank, California-based Disney said
yesterday in a statement. He was scheduled to relinquish the CEO
title on April 1, 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company cited a need for continuity and Iger's record
of success. Analysts have long cited Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and Tom Staggs, who leads the parks and resorts division,
as probable replacements. The two swapped roles in January 2010.
This year, Disney amended its compensation plan to allow for the
creation of new senior positions, such as chief operating
officer or president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Either the company does not believe that its current CEO
candidates are ready to take the helm or that Iger is not ready
to step down,' said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer
of Lisle, Illinois-based OakBrook Investments LLC, which
reported owning about 441,000 Disney shares as of June 28. 'I
doubt the Disney board would force Iger to retire at this point
anyway.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company credits Iger's leadership for total shareholder
return of 193 percent during his tenure, beating the 54 percent
return for the Standard  Poor's 500 Index, said Orin Smith,
Disney's independent lead director. Iger was named CEO in
September 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Now, Disney will continue to have the full benefit of Mr.
Iger's leadership as CEO and chairman for the duration of his
tenure,' Smith said in the statement, adding that the board
remains focused on finding a successor when his term ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.1 percent to $63.26 at the close in New York.
The shares have risen 27 percent this year, compared with 13
percent for the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said there will be no change to the terms of
Iger's compensation. He earned $40.2 million in 2012 in total
compensation last year, based on regulatory reporting rules, a
20 percent increase from the previous year. The company says 92
percent of his 2012 pay was performance based. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world's largest
entertainment company, resumed sales of new movies through Apple
Inc. (AAPL)'s online store in Japan after halting them temporarily in a
dispute over terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney said in a statement today that the transactions had
resumed, after the Burbank, California-based company had said on
its Japanese website yesterday that sales through iTunes of
films, including 'Frozen' and 'Thor: The Dark World,' had
stopped while rentals of existing titles continued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We deeply apologize to our customers for this enormous
inconvenience,' Disney said in the statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies have had close ties in the past and
Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger has been a board member
of Cupertino, California-based Apple since 2011. When video was
first added to iTunes, the entertainment company was the first
major studio to sign on with service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was a director at Disney before
his death in 2011. He became the entertainment company's biggest
shareholder after Disney in 2006 bought Pixar, the animation
studio he helped create. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls by Bloomberg News to the media office of Apple in
Japan seeking comment on the temporary halt weren't immediately
returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michael Eisner, who ran Walt Disney
Co. for 21 years, said his successor, Robert Iger, should
continue as chief executive officer beyond his recently extended
term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If I had my choice I would have him stay even longer, God
knows, maybe he will,' Eisner said in an interview yesterday
with Bloomberg Television at the Allen  Co. conference in Sun
Valley, Idaho. 'The longer he stays, the better it is for the
shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisner minimized the financial fallout from 'The Lone
Ranger,' a summer box-office failure for Disney. The company
also produced 2013's top picture, 'Iron Man 3,' which has sold
$1.2 billion in tickets worldwide, according to industry
researcher Box Office Mojo. Both men are attending the annual
gathering of entertainment, technology and finance executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The great thing about Disney (DIS) is this is such a big
company, as opposed to what it was when I went to it, that a
stumble like 'Lone Ranger' is going to have no effect,' Eisner
said. 'Their parks are strong, they have all those Marvel and
Pixar, Star Wars movies coming out.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 62, has been CEO of the world's largest entertainment
company since succeeding Eisner in 2005. Burbank, California-based Disney said on July 1 it extended his term another 15
months to June of 2016, citing the 193 percent total return to
shareholders during his tenure. Iger is also chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) and CBS Corp. (CBS) are being asked for information by U.S. antitrust officials probing Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s planned purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc., according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has reached out to the companies as it investigates whether the cable-industry merger is anticompetitive, said the people, who asked not to be named because the review isn't public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While none of the companies has publicly opposed the acquisition, some have said they want the U.S. to ensure that Comcast won't favor its own programming over their content if the merger is approved. Other media companies have also been approached, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among other issues, the antitrust division is asking about most-favored-nation clauses, one of the people said. The contracts are used by Philadelphia-based Comcast and other pay-TV providers to ensure competitors can't get better content-licensing deals with programmers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Media companies can help inform the Justice Department's assessment of whether the Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination risks hurting competition, said Amanda Wait, an antitrust attorney at Hunton  Williams LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Expanded Footprint' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'One of the big questions in the Comcast-Time Warner deal is how the expanded footprint of the cable company is going to affect its ability to deal with these content providers,' Wait said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department has been looking at most-favored-nation clauses, which stipulate that pay-TV operators such as Comcast can match subsequent deals networks get for their programming, for at least two years. In 2012, the antitrust division sent civil investigative demands, similar to subpoenas, to DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. about the agreements as part of a broader probe into whether pay-TV companies were squeezing out Internet-video competitors, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most-favored-nation contracts were also targeted in the Justice Department's 2012 lawsuit against Apple Inc. (AAPL) and five publishers over prices of digital books. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Individual Deals &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Vice Chairman Michael Burns criticized most-favored-nation clauses in April, saying contracts originally created to help smaller cable-TV companies compete now benefit larger players. The agreements prevent Lions Gate from doing individual deals, such as a promotion with one distributor, he said. That means consumers pay more, according to Burns. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, said in February it would spend $45.2 billion for No. 2 Time Warner Cable. In addition to the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission is also reviewing the deal. The FCC yesterday started its nonbinding 180-day clock for finishing the review. The Justice Department, which considers the effects on competition, could sue to block the acquisition, approve it with conditions or clear it without requiring changes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're all trying to figure out consolidation, what does it mean for all of us in the industry,' Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said at Allen  Co.'s media retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Higher Rates &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. and Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite TV provider, oppose the deal. Netflix, the video-streaming service, has said Comcast is already dominant enough to capture 'unprecedented fees,' and would gain more leverage combining with Time Warner Cable. Dish argues Comcast will extract lower prices from programmers, leading to higher rates for smaller competitors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comcast already won approval for its acquisition of NBCUniversal from the Justice Department in 2011. The company agreed to certain conditions as part of the deal, including making sure NBC's shows would be available on fair terms to pay-TV rivals such as Dish and DirecTV. Abiding by net neutrality rules were also a condition of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department could extend those same terms as part of any approval for Comcast's purchase of Time Warner Cable, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials with Comcast, Disney, CBS, Discovery and the Justice Department declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equal Footing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;CBS Chief Executive Officer Les Moonves told Bloomberg in May that equal access for his broadcast and cable channels on Comcast systems was an issue the company was studying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I am sure the DOJ will prevent NBC from getting any advantage or at least we assume so,' Moonves said on Bloomberg TV on May 15. 'We will be equally competitive with them on that basis.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;21st Century Fox Inc. Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey told Bloomberg News in May his company wants to make sure its online programs could be viewed on an equal footing with those of other services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is using the interviews with the media companies to understand the issues in the merger and guide the investigation, said one of the people. Discussions with the companies will probably be ongoing, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department typically has informal talks with third parties and then later can gather testimony under oath, according to Wait, the antitrust lawyer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They have a very complicated industry they're trying to understand,' Wait said. 'They're seeing a deal they may want to challenge in the future, so they're starting to put their ducks in a row in the event they decide to do that.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Phil Milford" datetime="Jul 15, 2013 10:07 AM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-15/disney-settles-antitrust-suit-over-recruiting-from-rivals.html"><headline>Disney Settles Antitrust Suit Over Recruiting From Rivals</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Units of Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the
world's largest theme-park operator, tentatively settled a
lawsuit alleging they violated U.S. antitrust law by agreeing
with competitors not to recruit one another's employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animation studio Pixar and visual-effects specialist
Lucasfilm Ltd. told U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose,
California, they agreed to settle all claims, according to court
papers filed July 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The parties anticipate completing documentation of the
proposed settlement and presenting it for the court's
consideration in the near future,' plaintiffs' lawyers said in
a letter to Koh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of high-tech employees sued the companies
complaining that industry agreements not to pursue cross-hires
amounted to a conspiracy 'to fix and suppress the compensation
of their employees,' according to an amended complaint filed on
Sept. 13, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, didn't immediately reply to an e-mail and a voice-mail
message seeking comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation,
11-cv-02509, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keith Olbermann, a TV host with a
history of drawing viewers and battling his bosses, will return
to Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ESPN sports network to host a nightly show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olbermann, 54, comes back to the network starting Aug. 26
with a daily late-night program airing at 11 p.m. New York time,
Bristol, Connecticut-based ESPN said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Olbermann' will air on ESPN 2, focusing on relevant
sports topics through a mix of commentary, interviews, panel
discussions and highlights. Olbermann, who hosted liberal-leaning shows on MSNBC and Current TV, won't discuss politics,
except as it relates to sports, he said on a conference call
with reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If George W. Bush wants to talk baseball, I'd be happy to
have him,' Olbermann said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olbermann had been a popular host on 'Sports Center,'
ESPN's nightly newscast, in the 1990s. The network is bringing
him back as it braces for competition from Fox Sports 1, a 24-hour channel from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox Inc. that
begins next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Clearly the timing of some of what we're doing is
intended to put us in a competitive position,' ESPN President
John Skipper said on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olbermann left ESPN in 1997 after falling out with
executives. Then after three years with Fox Sports Networks,
Olbermann landed at NBCUniversal's MSNBC. The political show
'Countdown With Keith Olbermann' ran for eight years and ended
with the host leaving in January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, Olbermann joined Al Gore's Current TV cable
channel in February 2011. The 13-month stint ended with lawsuits
and insults between Olbermann and the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There is no way to forecast my career path,'  Olbermann
said on the call. 'I've given up trying.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he appreciates the 'fresh start' at ESPN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.5 percent to
$65.36 at the New York close. The stock has climbed 31 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is eliminating perks including executive car allowances as the world's biggest entertainment company looks to further boost profitability. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're phasing them out,' Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said of the car allowances in an interview at last week's Allen  Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney has been reducing costs by firing hundreds of workers, closing offices and outsourcing duties like video-game development as it looks to widen profit margins and extend a more than doubling of the stock price in the past five years. Rasulo, who has been conducting a company-wide review of expenses, said he's seeking to modernize operations at Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We looked at the way technology is changing our businesses,' said Rasulo, who didn't discuss specifics. 'We're removing vestigial parts.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger has focused on efficiency since becoming CEO in 2005, said Robin Diedrich, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis who recommends the stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Operating margin, a measure of profitability, widened to 21 percent of sales in the most recent fiscal year from 13 percent in fiscal 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income has more than doubled to $5.68 billion, outpacing the 35 percent gain in sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry Ltd. (BB), the Canadian maker
of wireless communication devices, didn't infringe patents
belonging to a Michigan company, a federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc. sued
BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd., in
federal court in Delaware in June 2008, alleging that four
patents related to digital cameras in mobile telephones were
infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court entered a judgment against St. Clair in September
2012. St. Clair appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed
the trial court's ruling in a judgment delivered without
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellate case is St. Clair Intellectual Property v.
Matsushita Electrical Industries, 12-1652, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit. The lower court case is St. Clair
Intellectual Property v. Research In Motion Ltd.,08-cv-00371S,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney's Marvel Off the Hook for Spiderman Toy Patent Royalties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Marvel Enterprises unit didn't have to
continue pay royalties to an Arizona inventor after his patent
expired, a federal appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Kimble, whose patent 5,072,856 covers a toy web-shooting glove, sued Marvel for patent infringement in 1997,
claiming that the Spiderman Web Blaster infringed his patent. In
2001, the parties settled that dispute, granting Kimble an
initial cash payment and a percentage on future sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Marvel entered into an agreement with toymaker
Hasbro Inc. to produce the toy. Kimble and Marvel then disputed
the issue of further payment, and he filed another suit. The
court found that under his royalty agreement with Marvel, the
payments would stop when the patent expired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimble appealed that ruling, claiming the agreement covered
both patent and non-patent rights and that his compensation
should continue. The appeals court in a July 16 ruling said that
a license that covers both patent and non-patent rights is
unenforceable after the patent expires unless the agreement
provided for a discount for the non-patent rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a discount, the court said the post-expiration royalty payments were 'an improper extension of the
patent monopoly.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Kimble v. Marvel Enterprises Inc., 11-15605,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark Case Against VF's Vans Can Go Ahead, Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VF Corp. (VFC)'s Vans unit failed to persuade a U.S. court to
dismiss a trademark lawsuit brought by Airwair International
Ltd., a U.K.-based shoe manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airwair sued in federal court in San Jose, California, in
September claiming that Van's Gibson line of shoes infringed
trademarks and trade dress related to shoe design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vans asked the court to dismiss the case in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a July 17 order, U.S. District Judge Edward J. Davila
said that Airwair's complaint satisfied the requirements for the
case to go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Airwair International Ltd. v. Vans Inc., 12-cv-05060, U.D. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diller's Vimeo Seeks to End Vivendi Music Copyright Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vimeo, the video-sharing website owned by Barry Diller's
IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI), said federal law protects it against a
Vivendi SA (VIV) copyright lawsuit over music that includes recordings
by the Beatles and the Beach Boys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams heard arguments yesterday
on Vimeo's motion to throw out the case. She said at the end of
the three-hour hearing in Manhattan that she would rule later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi labels including Capitol Records sued Vimeo in 2009
claiming that the website 'induces and encourages its users to
upload' copyrighted videos and songs it wasn't authorized to
display. The songs include the Beatles' 'Let It Be,' the Beach
Boys' 'Surfin' USA' and Radiohead's 'High and Dry.' Users
post homemade videos in which they lip-synch to the infringed
songs, the labels said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vimeo, based in New York, denied infringing copyrights and
said that it's protected by the safe-harbor provision of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA. The safe-harbor rule
applies if a site removes infringing material when informed
about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which has more than 14 million registered
users, gets its revenue from subscription fees and advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels said that Vimeo can't be protected by law
because it knew that the uploaded videos contained unlicensed
copyrighted material and that it benefited financially from
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labels asked the judge to deny Vimeo's motion and grant
them partial summary judgment. If Abrams rejects the motions,
the case may go to trial by jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigation had been on hold pending a ruling in a
similar case, in which Viacom Inc. (VIAB) sued Google Inc.'s YouTube
for displaying Viacom's copyrighted television and movie content
on the web without authorization. The Second Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed a lower-court ruling in favor of YouTube and
sent the case back to district court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton then dismissed Viacom's
suit in April, saying YouTube was protected from liability by
the Copyright Act's safe-harbor provision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Capitol Records LLC v. Vimeo LLC, 1:09-cv-10101, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdated Mail Rule Helps Pangang, Kolon Elude U.S. Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's Pangang Group Co. and Korea's Kolon Industries Inc. (120110)
have eluded U.S. criminal charges of trade-secret theft for
months. Unlike fugitive security contractor Edward Snowden, they
aren't hiding from authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pangang and Kolon can't be forced yet to face the
accusations in court because federal rules dating to the 1940s
require prosecutors to issue a summons the old-fashioned way --
by mailing it to a U.S. address. The companies said they don't
have offices, employees or agents in the U.S. and can't be
served. Federal judges in California and Virginia have mostly
agreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors must file papers this week telling a judge in
San Francisco how they will proceed with Pangang while a judge
in Richmond, Virginia, is scheduled to hear arguments in Kolon's
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue threatens to derail the case against Pangang. The
company was charged in San Francisco last year with conspiring
to steal secrets from DuPont Co. (DD) about titanium dioxide, a white
pigment used in paint, plastics and paper. Kolon and five of its
executives were charged in October with stealing trade secrets
from DuPont related to the manufacture of Kevlar, the anti-ballistic fiber used in police and military gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are required to serve summonses on defendants
by delivering copies to officers or legal representatives and
mailing copies to the defendants' last known U.S. address,
according to federal rules of criminal procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department, saying the procedures have fallen
behind the 'new reality' of a global economy and electronic
communications, recommended the committee allow the serving of
summonses outside the U.S. by agreed-upon delivery methods with
foreign jurisdictions, according to an October letter from then-Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer to the committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Kolon Industries, 12-cr-00137, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond). The
Pangang case is U.S. v. Liew, 11-cr-00573, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) won a
U.S. appeals court ruling in a case of a former university
researcher who claimed his patents covered some of the
Internet's most basic interactive functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two patents owned by Eolas Technologies Inc. of Tyler,
Texas, and the University of California are invalid, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington ruled
yesterday. The decision, issued without a formal opinion,
upholds a jury verdict won by Google, Amazon.com, JC Penney Co.
and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year in Tyler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eolas founder Michael Doyle claimed functions including
music clips, search features, maps and embedded applications
used his inventions. Tim Berners-Lee, the British computer
scientist credited with inventing the World Wide Web, was among
those testifying against him in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eolas, in court papers, claimed the patents covered
inventions that 'took the Web from a primitive and static world
to today's seamlessly interactive environment.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its own filing with the court, Mountain View,
California-based Google and Plano, Texas-based JC Penney said
Eolas's claim was a 'fantastic assertion' rejected by the jury
'after hearing from the scientists who are actually responsible
for that achievement, including the father of the World Wide
Web.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a dozen companies had been named in the original
complaint, including Apple Inc., EBay Inc. (EBAY) and Citigroup Inc.
Most settled before the trial. Cases against Facebook Inc., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Walt Disney Co. (DIS) were stayed pending appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Eolas won a $521 million verdict against Microsoft
Corp. that was thrown out on appeal for a retrial on the
validity of the patents. The two companies settled before a new
trial could be held. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Eolas Technologies v. Amazon.com Inc., 12-1632,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower court case is Eolas Technologies Inc. v. Adobe Systems
Inc. (ADBE), 09-cv-00446, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Novozymes Loses Appeals Court Bid to Revive Danisco Verdict &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) lost its appeals court bid to revive an $18
million patent-infringement verdict against DuPont Co.'s Danisco
unit over an enzyme used in biofuel production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Novozymes patent for an enzyme that remains active in
high temperatures is invalid because it doesn't describe what
the company claims to have invented, the Washington-based U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in an opinion
posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute was patent 7,713,723, which was issued in May
2010, the same month in which Novozymes filed the infringement
suit in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court affirmed a trial judge's decision to
throw out the jury verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Novozymes A/S v. Danisco A/S, 3:10-cv-00251-BBC, U.S. District Court, Western District of Wisconsin
(Madison). The appeal is Novozymes A/S v. DuPont Nutrition
Biosciences, 12-01433, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Castel Group Loses Chinese Trademark Fight Over 'Kasite' Mark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castel Group, the French beverage maker, registered a new
Chinese trademark after losing a trademark dispute with a
Chinese wine distributor, Decanter reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French company had used 'Kasite' as a Chinese
translation of its name on labels for wine it began bottling in
China in 1999, according to Decanter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998 Panati Wine, the company owned by Chinese
entrepreneur Li Daozhi, registered 'Kasite' as a Chinese
trademark and sued Castel for trademark infringement in 2009,
according to Decanter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zhejiang Provincial Higher people's Court barred
Castel's use of 'Kasite,' levied a fine of 33.73 million
Chinese renminbi ($5.5 million), and ordered the company to
issue a public policy through a Chinese business publication,
Decanter reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taiwan District Will Use Folk Icon to Promote Regional Identity &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A district in Taiwan's Kaohsiung region has registered the
name of a Taoist folk icon as a trademark as a way to promote
the area, which lacks the kind of specialty agricultural
products often identified with a region, the Taipei Times
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saimin District registered 'Third Happy Prince' as a
trademark and then sponsored a public competition for the
creation of a modern image of the character, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cartoon figure was selected and his image includes the
district's landscape as a background, the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs Intellectual Property
Office approved the mark July 19, and the image will be used for
school bags, clothing and related items, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russian Patent Office Says Nyet to Boozy Trademark for Vodka &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian officials rejected a trademark application for a
new brand of vodka because it alludes to heavy drinking, the
Moscow Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 'Vyp/Buhalo' mark sought by Rusinvest 'contravenes
public interest and moral principles,' the Russian Patent
Agency said in its rejection notice, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Vyp' sounds like a colloquial Russian expression
meaning 'bottoms up,' and 'Buhalo' resembles a Russian word
for 'booze,' according to the Moscow Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent agency previously refused to register a phrase
that colloquially means 'delirium tremens.' That brand --
'Belochka. Ya prishla' -- got so much media attention over the
refusal that it was named the brand of the year in May, the
newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Artist Prints 3D Mickey Mouse, Challenges Disney IP Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artist and researcher at the U.K.'s Goldsmith College is
using 3D scanning and printing to challenge the intellectual
property policies of the Walt Disney Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Plummer-Fernandez 'uses scanning, digital
fabrication and computational approaches to making artifacts,
both physical and digital, that blur the distinction between the
two, referencing the digitization of the everyday,' according
to the biography posted on his website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has created several small figures of Disney's iconic
Mickey Mouse, using a powder composite and tinted binder. The
figures are fabricated by scanning and remixing the data derived
from the scan, according to his artist's statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plummer-Fernandez said he deliberately chose Mickey Mouse
as his subject in order to raise 'issues of potential clashes
with big copyright holders that could potentially choose to
lobby for legislation against 3D scanning.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney was a company of particular interest, he said, for
'paradoxically pioneering remix culture by creating their own
versions of public domain characters such as Snow White and
Cinderella, and yet the company take a hostile approach against
any attempts to copy their own creations.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his figures -- 'sekuMoi Mecy' -- is a distorted
figure covered in small geometric patterns in red and blue. The
name of his Mickey Mouse pieces comes from a computer-generated
anagram, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other figure is 'sekuMoi Mecy 3; Smooth() Operator,'
generated using what he called a 'mesh smoothing technique
pushed to the extreme.' That piece's contours are deliberately
much less detailed than the first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Blurring images has become both a widely recognized
cultural aesthetic,' he said. It is 'also used to obscure the
identity of persons photographed or filmed,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seagate Technology Wins Back $630 Million Trade-Secrets Award &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seagate Technology LLC won reinstatement of a $630.4
million arbitration judgment against Western Digital Corp. (WDC) over
allegations of misappropriation of trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arbitrator awarded Dublin-based Seagate $525 million
plus interest in 2011 against Irvine, California-based Western
Digital and a Western employee, Sining Mao, who previously
worked at Seagate. Some of the defendants' evidence was
fabricated on three trade secrets, the arbitrator found,
entering a judgment against Western and Mao as a sanction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state court judge set aside the award in October, finding
that the arbitrator didn't consider any evidence by the
defendants countering the allegations. Minnesota's Court of
Appeals reinstated the arbitrator's judgment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The district court erred by determining that the
arbitrator did not have authority to impose sanctions,' the
appellate court said. 'The district court should not have
reviewed the merits of the arbitrator's decision.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellate case is Seagate Technology LLC v. Western
Digital Corp., A12-1944, Minnesota Court of Appeals (St. Paul).
The lower-court case is Seagate Technology LLC v. Western

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney fighting with a malfunctioning robot of Abraham Lincoln -- what great fodder for a juicy operatic scene. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You wouldn't guess that from watching Philip Glass's 'The Perfect American,' having its U.K. premiere at English National Opera. At the end of Act 1, robo-Lincoln and Walt tussle. The music chugs without excitement. The curtain comes down quietly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's a robotic American president going crazy, for heaven's sake. Shouldn't there be a chorus screaming? Some brass playing comical raspberries? Some tension? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There should, and there isn't. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's symptomatic of the problems in Glass's 25th opera, which presents the imaginary memories of Disney as he lies dying in 1966. Even though Rudy Wurlitzer's libretto (based on a novel by Peter Stephan Jungk) is bitty, it does offer a few moments which cry out for big musical brush-strokes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The malfunctioning Lincoln-bot provides one such scene. There's another when megalomaniacal Walt insists he will never die, and forces his family and friends to salute the American flag and repeat the words 'Never say die.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could be a chilling set piece. Glass simply repeats the same few familiar chord progressions, and studiously avoids emotional peaks and troughs. You'd find more variety in the monitor of a coma patient going beep-beep-beep. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s California
Adventure, bolstered by a $1.1 billion expansion, led the
world's largest theme parks with a 23 percent surge in visitors
to 7.78 million last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance at the top 25 parks worldwide increased 5.2
percent to 205.9 million visitors in 2012, according to a report
today by the Themed Entertainment Association and the consulting
firm Aecom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The market in North America was, this year as last year,
driven by major reinvestment at the major operators' parks,'
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest theme park operator, tripled
its investment in its resorts division between 2008 and 2012,
spending $9.2'billion on two new cruise ships and improvements
to its properties. The company's net income jumped 32 percent to
$1.51 billion in the second quarter, in part due to higher
attendance and a surge in profits at its parks business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's California Adventure park in Anaheim opened its
Cars Land attraction in June 2012, drawing tourists to a new
area based on the Pixar 'Cars' films. Neighboring Disneyland
was the only park among the world's largest to register fewer
visitors last year, with attendance shrinking 1.1 percent to 16
million, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central Florida county is building
a toll road through swampland near Walt Disney World to speed
the commutes of local workers, financing the project by selling
low-rated debt to yield-hungry investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $70 million tax-exempt deal from Osceola County drew
Vanguard Group Inc., the world's biggest mutual fund company,
whose head of municipal securities, Chris Alwine, foresees
demand for more infrastructure funding. Citigroup Inc. (C) predicts
next year will bring the most muni toll-road issuance since 2010
as officials ramp up investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Poinciana Parkway being dug from the muck outside
Orlando shows how America's aging road system stands to benefit
from the search for yield with interest rates close to
generational lows. Investing in the project is like wagering on
a start-up venture: The bonds bear the lowest investment grade
and are backed by tolls to be collected on an unproven route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There's inherent demand given the level of congestion in
the area,' said Alwine of Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based
Vanguard. The company oversees about $130 billion in munis,
including about $42 million of the Osceola toll bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We look at the route relative to alternatives, the fares
that are proposed, and then the cushion, and we're comfortable
with the deal,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) showcased 'Lone
Ranger' and 'Monsters University' characters tied to its
Infinity video-game platform, which goes on sale in August and
is designed to boost the company's money-losing interactive
unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The play sets, drawing on characters from the forthcoming
Disney movies, feature plastic figurines that are set on top of
a base unit and appear on screen. The characters were shown
yesterday with the Infinity system at E3, the video-game
industry's annual conference in Los Angeles that runs through
this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, unveiled
Infinity in January, saying it would reduce costs and improve
earnings at its interactive division by incorporating characters
from multiple Disney movies in the same game. The company also
has been promoting other characters for the platform, including
from its 'Cars' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'You play your way and it is as fun for you as anyone
else,' said John Blackburn, chief executive officer of
Avalanche Software, a Disney Interactive unit. 'We want this to
be deep enough for a father to play with his sons but we wanted
it to be easy enough where kids can play as well.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burbank, California-based Disney will sell the figures,
which will come with 'power discs' that add special powers,
weapons and vehicles from Disney movies. A starter kit with the
base and figures from the 'Pirates' and 'Monsters'
franchises and 'The Incredibles' is priced at $75, and the
game can be played by four people over an Internet connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players can use characters from the starter pack across
other games. An area called 'Toy Box' allows users to create
their own game in genres including racing, sports, fighting and
world-building. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strong 'Buzz' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinity's combination of video-game play with collectible
figures is similar to 'Skylanders,' a game from Activision
Blizzard Inc. (ATVI) that generated more than $500 million in sales in
the U.S. last year. Infinity comes out Aug. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I think the buzz around Infinity is very strong,' Sean McGowan, an analyst at Needham  Co., said in an e-mail. 'It
comes at a time when parents are being asked to shell out a lot
of money for gadgets -- tablets and new consoles that already
have a solid claim on some of that discretionary budget, but if
it's a quarter the success of 'Skylanders,' it's a big hit.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney earlier this year pushed back the release date for
Infinity from June and said in a May 7 conference call that the
interactive division would report a loss in the current fiscal-third quarter similar to the $54 million shortfall it
experienced in the prior three-month period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We believe in Infinity,' Bob Iger, chairman and chief
executive officer, said on the call. 'We think it will be a
great product and it's going to help drive profitability for
fiscal year 2014.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.6 percent to $63.83 at the close today in New
York. The stock has gained 28 percent this year, compared with a
15 percent advance for the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toontown Online, loosely based on the 1988 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) film 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit,' was a multiplayer Internet game for kids and families that drew more than 1 million users after it was introduced in 2003. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney shut it down last year amid a shift away from subscription-based games. Now, it's getting a second life thanks to fans who have created a knockoff version without the company's permission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the original game, animal characters called Toons tried to prevent the takeover of their town by corporate robots called Cogs. After Disney closed Toontown Online in September to focus on other projects, about two dozen developers, many in high school or college, created Toontown Rewritten. The site is flourishing: traffic has grown so fast that users have to wait in line to play, according to the 16-year-old project leader. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're all just a bunch of nostalgic players who think that the game deserves to live a little longer,' said the teenager, Joey Ziolkowski, in a telephone interview from his parents' home in Princess Anne, Maryland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether to allow Toontown Rewritten to continue is a tricky decision for Disney. If the company lets Ziolkowski and his collaborators keep going, it builds goodwill with fans. On the other hand, Disney may want to sell the content in the future, and the company could suffer reputational damage if something bad happens to players online, according to Scott Landsbaum, a copyright attorney in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hachette Book Group agreed to buy
Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Hyperion, a 22-year-old publisher of books
such as Mitch Albom's 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the deal is completed, Hachette will become the
publisher of the more than 1,000 books for adult readers that
Hyperion has put out since it was started in 1991, according to
a statement today. Disney will continue to publish Disney-Hyperion branded kids' books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction gives Hachette more than 250 best-selling
works, including 'Always Looking Up' by Michael J. Fox and
'Jamie's Food Revolution' by chef Jamie Oliver. Hyperion also
is scheduled to publish about 25 new books that Hachette will
now oversee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Hyperion's strong nonfiction list in particular is a

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. (DISH) reached a
groundbreaking agreement to carry Walt Disney Co. programming,
gaining rights to offer Disney, ABC and ESPN shows over the Web
in addition to its satellite pay-TV service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiyear deal, which also ends legal standoff between
the companies over Dish's AutoHop ad-skipping technology, is the
first between Disney and a pay-TV provider to include so-called
over-the-top program rights. It will allow Englewood, Colorado-based Dish to offer Disney shows as part of a future  Web-based
subscription-TV service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The creation of this agreement has really been about
predicting the future of television with a visionary and
forward-leaning partner,' Joseph P. Clayton, Dish's chief
executive officer, said in a statement yesterday. The deal
creates 'a model from which to deliver exciting new services
tomorrow.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In signing Disney, Dish and its chairman, Charlie Ergen,
gain a head start against other pay-TV providers contemplating
selling monthly programming packages over the Internet. Such
products would break cable-TV companies free of their geographic
boundaries, and allow satellite systems such as Dish to offer
interactive features their services now lack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Phones, Tablets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Disney agreement, Dish customers will have access
to shows via televisions, smartphones, tablets, game consoles
and other connected devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV service, and
Disney, the largest entertainment company, reached the deal
after months of negotiations. As part of the accord, Dish will
delay the availability of its AutoHop feature, which lets
customers skip ads on recorded programs on the broadcast
networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AutoHop will now be available three days after the original
broadcast. Previously it was available after 24 hours. The
three-day window is important to broadcast networks because they
can sell advertising based on the extended viewing, Disney
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said in a
conference call last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We knew early on we had a responsibility with this deal
to not only do what was best for our business, but to also
position our industry for future growth,' Anne Sweeney, co-chairman of Disney's Media Networks division, said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AutoHop Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is the first content renewal for Dish with a major
television network since it launched AutoHop, Drew Crum, an
analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus  Co., said in a research note. It
provides opportunities for incremental revenue at Disney and
removes the risk of a blackout, said the analyst, who recommends
buying Disney stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AutoHop, introduced in May 2012, embroiled Dish in
litigation with ABC, CBS Corp., Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s NBC and 21st
Century Fox Inc.'s Fox over the feature. The deal announced
yesterday dismisses the litigation between Disney and Dish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish was little changed yesterday at $58.88 in New York
trading. Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 1.7 percent
to $79.46. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) investors turned
back calls for a future split of the two top jobs held by
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger, rejecting the
demands of three state pension funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty five percent of shareholders voting opposed the
split, Disney said today at its annual meeting in Phoenix. The
company's executive compensation and bonus plans passed, and
Iger was re-elected to the board with 98 percent support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Disney, the world's largest entertainment
company, were considering a proposal by the Connecticut
Retirement Plans  Trust Funds to split the roles of chairman
and CEO going forward. Iger, who plans to step down as CEO in
March 2015, led Disney to a 76 percent total shareholder return
for the fiscal year ended in September, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'He's had phenomenally good performance,' said Kannan
Ramaswamy, a professor of management at the Thunderbird School
of Global Management in Glendale, Arizona, who spoke before the
meeting. 'Shareholders should be happy. This was not the most
opportune time to pick a fight.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney reached an all-time closing high yesterday of
$56.48. The shares fell 0.2 percent to $56.36 at the close today
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is cutting 700 jobs,
a quarter of the employees at its interactive unit, in a
realignment of its video-game and Internet advertising
businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future games for consoles such as Sony Corp.'s PlayStation
and Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox will be licensed, James Pitaro,
president of Disney Interactive, said today in an interview.
Burbank, California-based Disney is also paring its online ad
sales team to focus on 'fewer and bigger partners.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will continue to invest in interactive,
including the Infinity game system and the upcoming 'Fantasia'
title, mobile game development in Japan and short-form videos on
the Web. It's also extending the Club Penguin online virtual
world to iPhone and Android platforms. The cuts announced today
are part of an effort to make the division profitable on a
consistent basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive division lost $87 million on sales of $1.06
billion in the year ended Sept. 28. While the unit made a profit
of $55 million in this year's first quarter ended in December,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said in February results this
period would be comparable to the $54 million loss in the second
quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division had one of the top 10 video games of 2013 with
its Infinity system, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.
Mobile traffic on its websites has about doubled since a
redesign two years ago, according to data from ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Ads &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling ads based on the mobile traffic has been
challenging, Pitaro said, explaining why the company is shifting
to more extensive sponsorships from display ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playdom, a maker of games for social media that Disney
acquired for $563 million in 2010, has also struggled to come up
with hits as the business shifted to mobile and customers balked
at paying even 99 cents for games, Pitaro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The industry has shifted from social games to mobile
games,' Pitaro said. 'Our focus is now mobile first.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pitaro became sole president of interactive in November. He
previously shared that title with former Playdom Chief Executive
Officer John Pleasants, who left at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose less than 1 percent to $83.34 at the close in
New York. The stock has advanced 9.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Anousha Sakoui and Christopher Palmeri" datetime="Mar 18, 2014  4:40 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-18/disney-in-compromise-with-shareholders-over-chairman-ceo-role.html"><headline>Disney Compromises With Shareholders on Chairman-CEO Role</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) reached a
compromise with shareholders, saying it will split the roles of
chairman and chief executive officer in the future under what
the company called 'normal' circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, amended
governance guidelines that already say the chairman will be an
independent director, unless the board decides 'the best
interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,'
according to a regulatory filing today. The change outlines
steps to be taken when the chairman isn't independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move averted a showdown at Disney's annual meeting,
held today in Portland, Oregon, and led by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger. A group of investors had sought a
shareholder vote on a measure to let owners of 3 percent or more
of the stock nominate board candidates. That plan was withdrawn
after talks with the company, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposal was submitted by Hermes Equity Ownership
Services, the California State Teachers Retirement System and
the Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds, according to a
January filing by Burbank, California-based Disney. They cited
the board's decision to make Iger chairman and CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut 'expressly reserves its rights to re-file the
resolution for the 2015 proxy season, if the engagement between
the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate
transparency on board leadership issues,' state Treasurer
Denise L. Nappier said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Annual Review &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its filing today, Disney said that, when the chairman
isn't independent, it will evaluate the arrangement annually and
include a written explanation in proxy materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger, 63, has been CEO since 2005 and added the role of
chairman in 2012. The board has turned back calls to split the
positions in previous years. Disney appointed an independent
chairman in 2004 amid a shareholder revolt against then-CEO
Michael Eisner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At today's meeting, investors voted 80 percent in favor of
the company's executive compensation plan, an increase from less
than 60 percent the past two years. They also rejected a
shareholder proposal to limit accelerated executive pay in the
event of a change in control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger earned $34.3 million in total compensation in fiscal
2013, a 15 percent decline as Disney failed to beat its targets
as handily as in the prior year. The company posted record sales
and profit for the third straight year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adviser's Take &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an advisory firm,
recommended that investors back the executive pay plan this year
after suggesting they reject it in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'CEO pay and company performance are reasonably aligned
for the year in review, and CEO total pay decreased, for the
first time since 2009,' ISS said in a Feb. 25 report. 'The
company has engaged with shareholders to seek input following
notable investor dissent to the say-on-pay proposal last year.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called say-on-pay proposals, required by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, give shareholders a
nonbinding advisory vote on executive pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, Iger said the company plans a pirate-themed
land in Shanghai Disneyland when it opens at the end of 2015. He
announced a third installment to 'Cars,' the Pixar film
series, and said the 'Star Wars' picture scheduled for 2015
will take place 30 years after 'Return of the Jedi.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.7 percent to $81.99 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 7.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s animated picture 'Frozen' has become Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)'s best-ever selling kids movie, the online retailer said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The film is No. 1 in both DVD/Blu-ray disc sales and digital downloads, Stacey Keller, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Amazon, said in an e-mail. The sales include advance orders which, for the DVD versions, began on Nov. 27. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney's two-disc Blu-ray and DVD pack sells for $19.96 on Amazon.com, while the digital download costs $14.99 for the standard version and $19.99 for the high-definition version through Amazon Instant Video. The Blu-ray and DVD versions were released yesterday, according to Disney. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Many of the buyers have already seen the movie and want to watch it over and over again with their kids,' said Paul Dergarabedian, senior analyst for the research firm Rentrak Corp. 'This film is unstoppable.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, made 'Frozen' available for digital download on Apple Inc.'s iTunes store as part of the introduction of its Disney Movies Anywhere application on Feb. 25. The movie was first available for advance ordering on iTunes when it opened in wide release in November, according to Christine Monaghan, an Apple spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Box Office &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bob Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, said yesterday at the company's annual shareholder meeting that 'Frozen' would pass the company's own 'Toy Story 3' to become the top-grossing animated film of all time. The movie has taken in $1.03 billion worldwide since its Nov. 22 release, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amazon's sales of the film were first reported by the Wrap.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney fell 1.8 percent to $80.52 at the close in New York. The stock has risen 5.4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Andy Fixmer" datetime="Mar 24, 2014  4:21 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-24/disney-names-abc-news-president-as-co-chairman-of-tv-unit.html"><headline>Disney Names ABC News President as Co-Chairman of TV Unit</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named ABC News
President Ben Sherwood as co-chairman of its media networks,
filling the vacancy created by the planned departure in January
of Anne Sweeney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood will begin the transition immediately as co-president of the Disney/ABC Television Group and will continue
to oversee news until a successor is named, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is
moving quickly to fill a key executive role that oversees the
company's largest division. Sherwood, 50, who will work
alongside ESPN President John Skipper as media co-chairman, will
be responsible for the Disney channels, the ABC broadcast
network and the ABC Family cable channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Ben is one of those unique executives who combine rich
creative experience with great business acumen,' Iger said in
the statement. 'He's also focused, strategic and competitive.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being named ABC News president in December 2010,
Sherwood oversaw 'Good Morning America' as it surpassed NBC's
'Today' show in viewers and narrowed the ratings gap between
ABC's 'World News' and NBC's 'Nightly News' in the evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ABC News partnership with Yahoo! Inc. under Sherwood
boosted the news division's online exposure and he helped
developed Fusion, a cable-TV channel joint venture with
Univision Communications Inc. that targets English-speaking
Latinos with news and lifestyle programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney's Largest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, fell 1.1
percent to $79.49 at the close in New York. The stock has risen
4 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media networks division, led by ESPN and the Disney-branded channels, is Disney's largest, generating $6.82 billion
in operating income, 64 percent of the company's total, in the
most recent fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweeney, 56, announced plans on March 11 to leave Disney
before the contest heats up to replace Iger, who plans to retire
in June 2016. Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and parks
division head Thomas Staggs have been mentioned frequently by
analysts as leading contenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Sweeney's direction, the Disney Channel quintupled
its subscriber base. She supervised the introduction of related
channels, including Disney XD, aimed at boys, and Disney Junior,
targeting preschoolers. In 2005, ABC became the first network to
make its shows available at Apple Inc.'s iTunes store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like other broadcast networks, ABC has struggled with
declining viewership of traditional television as consumers turn
to cable TV and Web-based options such as Netflix Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the television season that started in September, ABC is
averaging 7.42 million viewers in prime-time, a decline of 5.1
percent from a year earlier, according to Nielsen data. In the
advertiser-targeted group ages 18 to 49, ABC is in last place,
down 7.9 percent to 2.68 million viewers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for $500
million, gaining technology and experience with short-form
entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets 'strong' performance targets, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in a statement. That could
boost the total to $950 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the 'Shrek' movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,''Robert A. Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.'s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online video networks for young audiences, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buying Again &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There is a lot of good happening in digital video
networks,' Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. 'There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn't expensive to produce. There just hasn't
been a lot of meaningful profit yet.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world's largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for Club Penguin online world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading at
7:53 p.m. New York time after the deal was announced. The stock
fell 1.1 percent to $79.49 at the close and has gained 4 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maker Studios will report to Jay Rasulo, Disney's chief
financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney had $4.4 billion in cash at the end of September,
according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weakening yen has turned Japan's annual Golden Week, a string of springtime holidays, into a boon for domestic tourism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The uptick in the traditional May holiday week points toward one of the best years on record for Japan's tourism industry, still recovering from the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. The yen's slide, part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's drive to boost economic growth, is luring overseas travelers while tempting Japan's holidaymakers to stay home. Tokyo Disneyland expects a record number of visitors this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 22.8 million Japanese, or nearly a fifth of the population, will travel during the holiday period from April 25 to May 5, according an estimate from JTB Corp (JTBZ). That's the most since at least 1969, when Japan's biggest travel agency began the survey. Some 22.2 million of those will travel domestically and spend about 35,900 yen ($360) per trip, 2.9 percent more than last year, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The exchange rate does affect my plan to travel,' said Shizue Ohshima, 62, a housewife from the Kanagawa prefecture who is headed to the Noto peninsula about 360 miles (585 kilometers) northwest of Tokyo during Golden Week. Three or four years ago she visited Korea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I like Korean culture but it will be more expensive if I go now,' said Ohshima. 'Domestic travel is a lot cheaper.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An 18 percent decline in the yen against the dollar this year shows how it has become cheaper for foreign travelers to visit. Overseas tourists to Japan rose 26 percent in March from a year ago to 857,000, the second highest on record, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization. That's boosting revenue for businesses from bullet trains to tourist-friendly eateries like the Robot Restaurant in Tokyo's Shinjuku nightlife district, where bikini-clad staff stage mock fights with others in android and giant panda costumes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Southeast Asia Visitors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The general trend for domestic travel this year is more expensive, nearer, and shorter,' said Mayuko Igarashi, a spokeswoman at Rakuten Travel Inc., an online travel agency. 'Inbound travel from overseas is surging, it's double last year's as the weakening yen helps attract more visitors.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Japanese currency is forecast to weaken to 110 yen to the U.S. dollar in 2014 from an estimated 100 in the second quarter of this year, according to the median of economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Prime Minister Abe, in office since December, has pledged to use monetary easing and fiscal stimulus to lift Japan out of more than a decade of price falls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pandas, Robots &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visitors from Thailand will increase nearly fivefold and tourists from Taiwan will more than double during Golden Week, according to a study from Rakuten. The Thai baht, the Korean won, the Chinese yuan, and the Singapore and Hong Kong dollar have all risen more than 20 percent against the yen during the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Okinawa reservations more then tripled while Kyoto bookings for inbound travelers increased 177 percent from the same holiday period last year, according to Rakuten. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Overall, visitors from Asia are notably increasing,' according to JTB spokeswoman Akiko Mitsuhashi, who said one of the agency's top selling tour destinations is a bus trip to Mt. Fuji and hot springs. 'The weakening yen is helping them come over here.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oriental Land Co (4661)., the operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, which had a record 27.5 million visitors last fiscal year, is expecting a fresh record of 27.7 million visitors this year, said Umi Ishimura, a spokeswoman. Foreigners make up about 3 percent of the resort's customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Budget Airlines &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Robot Restaurant, where nightly floorshows feature performers riding giant prehistoric creatures as well as robots and sword-wielding pandas, non-Japanese customers are on the rise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreign visitors rose from about 10 percent last summer before the yen began to weaken to about 30 percent today, said Yumi Ito, a spokeswoman for Josen Musical, the operator of Robot Restaurant. The venue also boosted advertising during the same period, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Central Japan Railway Co (9022)., operator of Japan's busiest bullet trains, said bookings for its high-speed service during Golden Week were up 6 percent compared with a year earlier, at 1.22 million seats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There are a lot of passengers coming to Tokyo this year,' said Kenichiro Yakura, a spokesman at for the rail operator. 'Many people want to visit Tokyo Disneyland for its 30th anniversary and see Tokyo Skytree,' the capital's latest landmark tower. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Family Sightseeing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The start of operations at three low-cost carriers last year is also drawing more people to the skies. Peach Aviation Ltd (AFACZ)., the only one of the three that was flying last May, said reservations for domestic flights nearly doubled to 55,077 seats during Golden Week, as it boosted capacity 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Occupancy rates at the Tokyo's Imperial Hotel are higher during Golden Week than a year ago, said spokesman Akitaka Minakata, who attributes the increase to Japanese families in town for sightseeing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreign guest occupancy rates are still recovering from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People say the recent trend for travel is more expensive, nearer, and shorter, and that fits my traveling style,' said Mineko Yamaguchi, 74, a housewife from Urawa, Saitama. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm not going anywhere during the Golden Week aside from visiting family graves.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="May 01, 2013 12:01 AM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-01/cedar-fair-coaster-riders-buy-on-credit-in-disney-shadow.html"><headline>Cedar Fair Coaster Riders Buy on Credit in Disney Shadow</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;After years of reining in spending,
Aney Salas was ready to spring a bit for her kids to have some
fun. So they headed to Knott's Berry Farm, a 73-year-old
amusement park near Los Angeles. The draw, other than nine
terrifying roller coasters: annual passes that cost $72 each,
payable in six monthly installments of $12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'A payment plan really helps,' the 31-year-old mother of
four said while shepherding her flock out of the car. 'It makes
it really affordable.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Ouimet, chairman and chief executive officer of
Cedar Fair LP (FUN), which owns 16 amusement and water parks including
Knott's, expects attendance and sales at the company to exceed
last year's records in part due to pricing initiatives such as
the payment plan introduced in February 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knott's, operating in the shadow of Disneyland just six
miles away, also offers a discount of as much as 38 percent off
the $60 single-day ticket to people who buy in advance online.
Customers who hate waiting can pay $35 extra to cut to the front
on 12 popular rides such as Montezooma's Revenge, which sends
riders 'zooming' forward and backward through a seven-story
loop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We're seeing a barbell economy,' Ouimet said over the
screams of roller-coaster riders in the park. Some consumers are
willing to pay extra for perks such as cutting lines, while
others require 'a more benefit-oriented' pitch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s decision to pull out
of Bangladesh is fueling debate over whether other manufacturers
should leave the country or stay put to improve workplace
conditions in the South Asian nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, removed
Bangladesh in March from a list of countries where it authorizes
partners to produce clothing and merchandise, according to a
letter to licensees released yesterday. Belarus, Ecuador,
Pakistan and Venezuela were also taken off the list, which cut
the number of acceptable nations to 172 from 215, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Disney's contractors had less than 1 percent of the
company's production in Bangladesh, marketers with more activity
there will have to decide whether to stay and spend to improve
worker safety or go elsewhere and potentially see the costs of
their products rise even more. They need to make the calculation
as they assess the risk to their brand names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There is a move afoot for companies to say clearly, 'We
need to be part of bigger oversight procedures,'' Cory Krupp,
an associate professor at Duke University's Sanford School of
Public Policy, said in a phone interview. 'The other way is
just to move to Vietnam or Cambodia where they have better
standards and the government is better at upholding them, and
Bangladesh is going to learn the hard way.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Iron Man 3,' the superhero movie
from Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Marvel division, may earn as much as $170
million in its opening weekend, placing it among the best debuts
ever, box-office tracker Hollywood.com Box-Office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would be the second-best premiere since 'The
Avengers,' also from Marvel, opened with $207.4 million a year
ago. The current No. 2 is Time Warner Inc. (TWX)'s 'Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows - Part 2,' which had sales of $169.2
million in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big debut for 'Iron Man 3' would start Hollywood's
summer on a positive note as domestic ticket sales year to date
lag the year-ago period by 12 percent. With potential
blockbusters including 'Star Trek' and 'Man of Steel' lined
up, the momentum could carry through to September, allowing
studios and theaters to approach 2012's record $10.8 billion box
office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's showings in 4,253 theaters generated $68.3
million in receipts, the ninth-biggest single-day gross ever,
Hollywood.com said. The top single-day take was the $90.1
million earned by Warner Bros. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows - Part 2.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Iron Man 3' has already opened internationally and
generated big numbers which, in turn, has prompted U.S.-based
analysts to raise their estimates for its run in the U.S. and
Canada. The movie has generated $361 million in global ticket
sales, including $15.6 million from late-night screenings at
U.S. theaters May 2, Disney said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Iron Man' had $38.7 million on its first day in 2008,
and $98.6 million in its opening weekend. 'Iron Man 2' earned
$51.2 million in its first day in 2010, and $128.1 million for
its debut weekend, Hollywood.com said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Frozen' continues to sizzle for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), where quarterly profit rose 27 percent as kids
snapped up DVDs and merchandise tied to the animated mega-hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, reported
second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts' estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Frozen' is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney's other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The whole thing is doing well,' said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. 'You talk about hitting on every cylinder.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of 'Frozen' and 'Thor: The Dark
World,' according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Frozen' Assets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Frozen' came out in home video during the period and has
become the company's biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn't sustain itself over a
fairly long period of  time,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With help from Marvel pictures and the resurgent Disney
animation unit, film studio profit for the year may top $1
billion for the first time since 2008, Alan Gould, an analyst at
Evercore Group LLC, wrote in an April 16 note. He has the
equivalent of a buy rating on Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating income at Disney cable networks rose 15 percent
to $1.97 billion, reflecting growth in pay-TV subscriber fees
for channels such as ESPN. Revenue increased 5 percent to $3.63
billion, even as ad sales shrank at the sports channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Broadcast Division &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at the ABC broadcast unit increased 15 percent to
$159 million, buoyed by higher affiliate fees and cost-cutting,
the company said. Revenue was little changed at $1.5 billion,
reflecting smaller audiences watching the broadcast network &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's namesake theme parks increased profit 19 percent
to $457 million as the division weathered a later Easter
holiday, which pulled business from the January-March quarter
into the current period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company credited higher attendance at California's
Disneyland resort and increased guest spending at Walt Disney
World in Florida. Revenue grew 7.9 percent to $3.56 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from consumer products expanded 37 percent to $274
million, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Stores &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Nine out of the 10 highest-selling items at the Disney
store in the quarter were 'Frozen' merchandise,' Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensing revenue grew on sales of merchandise related to
Disney channel program, along with products based on Mickey
Mouse and Minnie and the animated feature 'Planes.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys and costumes featuring the film's Elsa character have
outsold perennial top-performers Cinderella and Snow White on
EBay Inc. in the past year, according to Terapeak, an online
commerce tracker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive division posted a profit of $14 million,
reversing a loss a year earlier, on the strength of sales of
Disney Infinity, the company's video-game platform. Revenue grew
38 percent to $268 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ABC network, staking
a claim to growth in online video ads, will brief advertisers
next week on a service providing live shows on mobile phones and
tablets, people with knowledge of the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch ABC, a first-of-its-kind application from a
broadcaster, will stream live and archived shows to pay-TV
subscribers, said the people, who sought anonymity because the
plans aren't public. It could be released near the new TV season
in September, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With online video ad sales growing faster than network TV
revenue, Disney and other programmers such as News Corp.'s Fox
are developing ways to let audiences watch away from home on
smartphones and products such as Apple Inc.'s iPad. The move
pits entertainment companies against Google Inc. (GOOG)'s YouTube and
Facebook Inc. (FB) for an ad market that Morgan Stanley (MS) predicts will
grow 18 percent to $2.73 billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'While the audience online is still small, it's growing
fast and represents one of the biggest opportunities for the
media companies,' Ben Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst in
New York, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Watch ESPN, the mobile TV service offered by
Burbank, California-based Disney's sports channel, Watch ABC
represents a potential new revenue source. The network will
outline the product to advertisers in New York next week during
upfront sales presentations for the September 2013 TV season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix Inc. (NFLX), the world's largest
subscription video service, added five shows from Walt Disney
Co.'s cable channels, strengthening its programming for families
with children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiyear agreement gives Los Gatos, California-based
Netflix exclusive U.S. subscription streaming rights to Disney
Junior's 'Jake and the Never Land Pirates' and 'Tron:
Uprising,' which airs on Disney XD, the companies said today in
a statement. Terms for the shows, which began streaming today,
weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal bolsters Netflix's lineup of kids' shows as it
focuses on exclusives and children's programming to stand out
from competitors such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the largest Web
retailer, and Hulu LLC. The new rights build on an agreement in
December giving Netflix access to films from Disney's Pixar,
Marvel and Lucasfilm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, the leading online subscription service, has also
funded original programs such as the political thriller 'House
of Cards,' and obtained rights to the revived Fox show
'Arrested Development,' which begins streaming new episodes
May 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the new Disney agreement, Netflix will begin
streaming 'Handy Manny,' 'Special Agent Oso' and 'JoJo's
Circus' on a non-exclusive basis this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix signed a multi-year accord with Disney in December,
covering films that become available starting in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix rose 3.7 percent to $216.41 at the close in New
York. The shares have more than doubled this year, the biggest
rise among members of the SP 500 Index. (SPX) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) sued Roche
Holding AG (ROG)'s Genentech unit seeking a court order that it
doesn't infringe patents used to make treatments for cancer and
autoimmune diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents, known as 'Cabilly' after one of the
inventors, are invalid and aren't infringed by colon cancer and
melanoma treatments New York-based Bristol-Myers sells in the
U.S., the company's attorneys claimed in a complaint filed May 3
in federal court in Oakland, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cabilly patents, which have been the subject of high-profile legal disputes, were characterized as 'a bottleneck'
with respect to antibody-expression technologies by Ulrich
Storz, a patent counsel with Dusseldorf, Germany's Michalski
H'ttermann  Partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing in the Landes Bioscience Journal mABS, Storz said
that U.S. companies using these technologies must either 'go
through this bottleneck or face legal action, either as a
claimant (e.g., in an invalidity action or a non-infringement
action) or as a defendant (e.g., in an infringement action).' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb said it filed the suit 'to lift the
cloud created by the imminent threat of defendant's enforcement
of the Cabilly patents against the plaintiffs,' according to
the complaint. 'Without declaratory relief the threat of
enforcement of the Cabilly patents poses a substantial risk to
the plaintiffs as well as to patients, nurses and doctors now
using Erbitux and Yervoy.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erbitux, made by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)'s
ImClone unit, is approved in the U.S. to treat colon cancer and
head and neck tumors and sold by Bristol-Myers in the U.S.
Yervoy, a melanoma treatment, is manufactured and sold by
Bristol-Myers in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We remain confident in the validity and enforceability of
the Cabilly patents and we believe that the lawsuit is without
merit,' Nadine Pinell, a Genentech spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly filed a similar lawsuit over the Cabilly patents
in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Genentech, 13-cv-02045,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disney Withdraws 'Dia de los Muertos' Trademark Application &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Co. (DIS) withdrew the applications it filed with
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to register 'Dia de los
Muertos' as a trademark, the Los Angeles Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burbank, California-based company said the filings were
aimed at protecting a forthcoming film about the Mexican
religious holiday known as Day of the Dead, the newspaper
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studio told the Times it was changing the name of the
film and therefore didn't need the trademark protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A petition opposing the registration was put on the
Change.org website May 7 and by yesterday morning, it had more
than 19,000 signatures, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Asks Appeals Court to Reject Class-Action Authors Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) asked an appeals court to reject class-action
status for a $3 billion lawsuit by authors claiming that its
project to digitize millions of books from libraries violates
their copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Google and three writers who sued, including
Jim Bouton, the author of 'Ball Four,' argued their case
yesterday before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google seeks reversal of a lower-court order granting
class-action certification. The judges said they would make
their ruling later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Plaintiffs cannot claim to represent the many class
members who benefit from and approve of Google Books,' Seth
Waxman, a lawyer for Mountain View, California-based Google,
told the judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Authors Guild, which represents writers, and individual
authors sued Google in 2005, charging that the Internet search
engine operator was digitizing books from libraries without
seeking permission from copyright owners or paying fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Denny Chin rejected a negotiated settlement by the
parties in 2011. Attempts to renegotiate the deal failed, and
the litigation resumed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chin granted class certification last year to all authors
residing in the U.S. who have at least one book in Google's
project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A class-action suit makes it possible for all those who
meet the criteria to sue together rather than separately,
increasing the chances of a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Let's get it adjudicated on a class basis, not piecemeal,
book by book,' Robert LaRocca, a lawyer for the authors, told
the judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said in court papers it has digitally scanned more
than 20 million books worldwide and that Internet searchers
would be able to view 'snippets' of each book online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Authors Guild v. Google, 12-3200, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Defcad Offers Rights-Free Plans for 3-D Printed Plastic Weapons &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defcad, the website operated in conjunction with the
'Liberator' gun made using 3-D printing technology, now offers
downloadable plans for a wide range of weapons to be made the
same way. The Liberator, which is made solely from 3-D printed
plastic and a household nail, has been successfully fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cody R. Wilson, a law student at the University of Texas,
is behind Defcad. Wilson's Austin, Texas-based Defense
Distribution says it is the home of a project 'to create freely
available plans for 3-D printable guns.'  The website includes
poet John Milton's 'Areopagita,' published in 1644 in
opposition to the licensing of books and censorship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the website, Defcad is aimed at being a search
engine for 3D printing. Among the downloadable plans it offers
are silencers, ammunition, basic and Russian grenades, and high-capacity ammunition magazines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site hosts firearms-related files and makes them
available because 'when we say freedom of information, we mean
it.' No uploaded files will be censored unless they contain
'malicious software' according to the Defcad site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Judge Accused Porno-Infringement Lawyers of 'Moral Turpitude' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge hearing a copyright case involving alleged
unauthorized downloading of adult films said four of the lawyers
involved in a series of related cases 'suffer from moral
turpitude unbecoming an officer of the court.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a May 6 order, U.S. District Judge Otis D. Wright II
said that John Steele and Paul Hansmeier of Chicago's Steele
Hansmeier PLLC; and Paul Duffy and Brent Gibbs of Mill Valley,
California's Prenda Law Inc. committed 'brazen misconduct' and
'relentless fraud' in their pursuit of alleged infringers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wright outlined what he said was the four lawyers' strategy
of accusing individuals of illegally downloading a single
pornographic video, then settling for a cost 'calculated to be
just below the cost of a bare-bones defense.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the individuals accused of infringement, Wright said
'resistance is futile. Most reluctantly pay rather than have
their names associated with illegally downloading porn.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, 'copyright laws originally designed to
compensate starving artists allow starving attorneys, in this
electronic media era, to plunder the citizenry.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said the copyright owners showed little desire to
proceed in these lawsuits when faced with a 'determined'
defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to referring the four lawyers to the discipline
committees of their various state and federal bar associations,
the judge said he would refer their actions to the U.S. Attorney
for the Central District of California and to the criminal
investigation division of the Internal Revenue Service, and will
inform all judges before whom they have pending cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyers and the copyright owners also must pay attorney
fees of more than $81,000 to one unnamed defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with AVN Media Network, which covers the
adult-film industry, Steele said he would appeal the ruling. He
said that he wasn't an attorney in the case at issue and 'have
never practiced law in California.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that 'hundreds' of judges around the country have
ruled on similar cases and have thrown out 'crazy conspiracy
theories' brought by defense counsel, which includes the San
Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said with respect to the discipline-committee referrals,
'the Illinois Bar is well aware of this type of litigation. I
have had inquiries from the office of the Illinois State Bar and
have satisfied their requests in the past.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Steele filed a defamation suit, first in Florida
state court and then in federal court, against defendants who
criticized his handling of a copyright-infringement suit against
them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said in that suit that if the allegations made against
him were seen in the light of day, they would prompt those who
knew the plaintiffs 'to suggest (or intervene and force)
intensive psychological therapy.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He filed a dismissal of that case March 6 without giving
any reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was John L. Steele v. Paul Godfread, 1:13-cv-20744-JAL, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in which he and the other lawyers were sanctioned
is Ingenuity 13 LLC v. John Doe, 2:12-cv-08333-OLDW, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advanced Cyber Attack Tools Seen as Readily Available to Hackers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced cyber attack tools have become readily available
for use by foreign governments and terrorists to infiltrate or
cripple U.S. computer networks, two federal law enforcement
officials told a congressional panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of countries now have sophisticated cyber espionage
capabilities and terrorists want to 'Joseph Demarest, 'digitally
sabotage' U.S. power grids or water supply networks, assistant
director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's cyber
division, said in prepared testimony for a Senate hearing
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama and intelligence officials have said
one of their top policy priorities is preventing cyber attacks
that could disrupt banks, telecommunications networks, utilities
or other vital services. Lawmakers have renewed their efforts to
advance cybersecurity legislation after Congress failed last
year to pass a bill. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime
and Terrorism held a hearing yesterday on how the government and
private sector are responding to cyber threats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advanced cyber tools that Symantec Inc. has found
recently being used for attacks include large scale data
breaches that last year exposed about 93 million identities,
'watering hole attacks' that target visitors to legitimate
websites and the use of an estimated 3.4 million bot zombies
around the world last year, according to the testimony of Cheri
McGuire, Symantec's vice president for global affairs and cyber-security policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity threats posed by foreign governments and
terrorist groups against U.S. networks are growing, Jenny
Durkan, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington,
said in prepared testimony for the hearing.     ' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help prevent attacks, the Justice Department is
establishing cells of cybersecurity specialists 'to focus on
particular high-priority cyber targets,' Durkan said. She said
one cell is operational, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been 'an uptick' in cyber attacks against U.S.
electric companies this year, Carl Herberger, a vice president
for the network security firm Radware Ltd. (RDWR), said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information-technology systems at three different electric
companies were temporarily knocked off-line by cyber-attacks
this year, said Herberger, whose company is based in Tel-Aviv
with offices in New Jersey. He declined to discuss specifics or
name the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that groups in
China and Russia are responsible for electronic intrusions into
U.S. computer networks and the theft of intellectual property,
Durkan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ABC network, ranked
last among the TV viewers that advertisers target, will add five
comedies and seven dramas to its schedule, including a show
based on the secret agency from Marvel's 'Avengers.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,' from producer Joss Whedon, will air on Tuesdays at 8 p.m., ABC said today in an e-mailed statement. The network and other broadcasters are showing
their new lineups to advertisers this week in an annual event
known as the 'upfronts.' (See schedule below) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action series marks an effort by the network to draw
more young male viewers, an elusive group on broadcast TV, to a
schedule that skews more toward women with 'Grey's Anatomy'
and 'Nashville.' It's also leveraging the highly successful
films based on Marvel superheroes, such as Iron Man. Including a
reality series, ABC unveiled 13 new programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'That should work better at getting younger male
viewers,' said Brad Adgate, director of research at New York
advertising company Horizon Media Inc. 'The network has very
little live sports, which has hindered its ability to become a
destination for male viewers.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 65 percent of ABC's viewers are female, Adgate said,
citing Nielsen data. The average age of ABC's viewers is about
53, second oldest to CBS, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, also owner of ESPN, gained 0.2 percent to $67.47 at
the close in New York. Shares of the Burbank, California-based
company have climbed 36 percent this year, compared with 16
percent for the Standard  Poor's 500 index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upscale Women &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 'S.H.I.E.L.D,' Clark Gregg reprises the role of Agent
Phil Coulson from the Marvel films. He assembles a group of
agents who protect the public from strange occurrences around
the world. The timeslot would pit the show against CBS (CBS)'s
'NCIS,' the most-watched drama on television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Our job is to be inclusive,' Paul Lee, president of the
ABC Entertainment Group, told reporters on a conference call.
'We are a big, broad network that does over deliver on upscale
audience and does over deliver on upscale women.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new season, 'Dancing with the Stars' will air
its performance and results shows in a single two-hour block on
Mondays. On Tuesdays, starting with 'S.H.I.E.L.D.,' ABC plans
all new programs. Networks regularly schedule new shows after a
well-established program to draw viewers. That practice is
changing due to DVRs, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Lead-in does matter and it is important,' Lee said. 'It
is at times compromised by huge DVR viewing from the previous
show. We put on shows and started off with shows we knew we
loved and that we would get behind and market.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Women's Empowerment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,' a spinoff of
'Once Upon a Time,' ABC creates an all-drama Thursday night
that includes 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Scandal.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 'Wonderland,' set in Victorian England, Sophie Lowe
plays Alice telling stories of a strange new land on the other
side of a rabbit hole. The network 'built a night of women's
empowerment,' Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other dramas to be added this year will include 'Lucky 7'
on Tuesdays and 'Betrayal' on Sundays. ABC's four September
comedies include 'The Goldbergs,' 'Trophy Wife,' 'Back in
the Game,' and 'Super Fun Night,' the network said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC ordered a reality series called 'The Quest,' from the
producers of 'The Lord of the Rings' movies and 'The Amazing
Race' TV show, according to the statement. In the show, 12
contestants face challenges in a fantasy world with mythical
creatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network also ordered 'Toy Story of Terror,' a
Halloween special from Disney's Pixar animation studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Lineups &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC ranks last in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic group
that marketers target, with that audience down 9.1 percent for
the season through May 12, Nielsen data show. The network is
second in total viewers behind CBS, averaging 7.8 million
viewers a night, down 6.5 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. TV networks are introducing new shows ahead of
meetings with their biggest advertisers to obtain commitments
and set ad rates for the TV season that begins in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NBC, which announced its schedule on May 12, picked up
three dramas and three comedies, including 'The Michael J. Fox
Show.' News Corp. (NWSA)'s Fox said yesterday it will add nine
programs, including the comedy 'Dads' from Seth MacFarlane and
the drama 'Almost Human' from 'Star Trek' producer J.J. Abrams. CBS plans to announce its new shows tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad spending on network television is projected to decline 2
percent this year to $16.9 billion, and total TV advertising,
including cable networks, will increase 2.8 percent to $63.9
billion, slowing from 7.1 percent in 2012, according to
ZenithOptimedia, Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)'s research division. &lt;/p&gt;

The biggest international market was China with $104 million
in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, has cut
back on the number of films it releases to focus on ones with
global appeal and the potential to be parlayed into other
businesses. This week the Burbank, California-based firm
announced that a 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.' television
show, based on its comic book characters, would debut on the
company's ABC network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney shares fell less than 1 percent to $65.96 at 12:14
p.m. in New York. The stock is up 34 percent this year through
yesterday, while the Standard  Poor's 500 Index has added 16
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jay Rasulo, seen as one of two
possible successors to Walt Disney (DIS) Co. Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger, invokes his company's well-known characters when
discussing his role as chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I gotta have a big heart, I gotta love everybody, I've
gotta reach out to the world as Woody does in our stories,'
Rasulo said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference when asked why
he sometimes compares himself to the 'Toy Story' hero. 'But
on the other hand I'm still counting the money like Scrooge
McDuck.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo said Disney often faces decisions that cost in the
short run and yet build stronger ties with consumers, such as
policing foreign makers of licensed goods. He became finance
chief in 2009, after leading Disney's parks for about seven
years, when Iger asked him and then-CFO Tom Staggs to switch
jobs. Both men are seen as possible successors when Iger steps
down in 2016. Rasulo didn't address that issue today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It has been an incredible learning and broadening
experience, certainly for me, I'm sure on both sides of it,'
said Rasulo, 58. 'In this role you get to experience the
breadth of the Walt Disney Co.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo, a Columbia University economics graduate who
started out with the company in strategic planning in 1986, said
part of Disney's success lies in how it deploys capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 65 percent is reinvested in the businesses, such as
theme-park rides, movies or sports rights for the ESPN network,
among the largest contributors to Disney profit, he said. The
company also pays dividends, buys back stock, and seeks
acquisitions that add to its character library or provide new
distribution outlets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost-Cutting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, Rasulo, who also has master's degrees from the
University of Chicago, supervised a company-wide cost-cutting
initiative, designed to make sure the company was adapting to
technological changes in its businesses. That led to hundreds
firings across several divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, Rasulo's boss appointed him to oversee Disney's
$500 million acquisition of Maker Studios, the money-losing
provider of online short-form videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo often speaks to Disney employees about career
planning, including his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I advise people, just do what's right in front of you and
good things happen rather than trying to be Machiavellian in
planning the next five steps of your career,' Rasulo said. 'It
will never turn out the way you think.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo sits about 40 feet from Iger and the two chat all
the time, along with communicating by e-mail, and when traveling
together, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There's not a lot of formality to Bob,' Rasulo said.
'He's a very free and easy, casual interactor.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;28 Years &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Rasulo joined Disney 28 years ago, the company had
about $2 billion in annual sales and earned most of its profit
from theme parks. The studio, established by Walt Disney in
1923, was struggling, the Disney Channel had fewer than 3
million subscribers, and Rasulo described the consumer products
business as 'fledgling.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We used to get this check from Europe, we never knew what
it was for,' Rasulo recalled. 'Presumably it was from people
selling consumer products. We never audited anybody.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Disney is the world's largest entertainment company,
with more than $45 billion in sales. More than half its profit
comes from television, including ESPN, the Disney channels and
the ABC television network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his free time, Rasulo said he likes to fly fish, a hobby
that provides lessons for life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The reason I love fly fishing is because you focus right
on the here and now, and put away all other distractions,'
Rasulo said. 'Otherwise you basically just get cold and wet and
come home with no fish.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="May 20, 2014 11:21 AM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-20/disney-analyzing-pay-tv-mergers-for-impact-on-business.html"><headline>Disney Analyzing Pay-TV Mergers for Impact on Business</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is evaluating how the
planned merger of ATT Inc. (T) and DirecTV will affect its
business, according to Jay Rasulo, chief financial officer of
the world's biggest entertainment company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Whether it's that merger or Comcast-Time Warner Cable (TWC),
it's no surprise to us that there is consolidation,' Rasulo
said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference in New York. 'We
have strong relationships with all of those companies. We are
analyzing how that will affect the ecosystem. This is early
days.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, owner of ESPN, the Disney Channel and the ABC
broadcast network, is one of the biggest suppliers of
programming to cable and satellite TV providers. Like other
content producers, the company has been selling more of its
shows to online networks such as Netflix Inc. (NFLX), which represent a
threat to pay-TV distributors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $48.5 billion ATT-DirecTV deal, announced this week,
and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s $45 billion plan to acquire Time Warner
Cable Inc., involve four of the biggest buyers, potentially
giving them more clout in content negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We recognize there is a change in the landscape from what
has been a very valuable and profitable landscape,' Rasulo
said. 'The world is evolving toward more content being
distributed over the top. Netflix is a great example. There will
be more.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="May 21, 2013  5:16 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-21/disney-s-espn-trims-fewer-than-400-jobs-amid-companywide-cuts.html"><headline>Disney's ESPN Trims Fewer Than 400 Jobs Amid Company Cuts</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ESPN sports
television division fired several hundred workers today, part of
a companywide drive to improve profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firings number fewer than 400 and include unfilled
positions, according to a person with knowledge of the situation
who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be
named. ESPN, based in Bristol, Connecticut, announced the cuts
in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We are implementing changes across the company to enhance
our continued growth while smartly managing costs,' ESPN said
in the statement. 'While difficult, we are confident that it
will make us more competitive, innovative and productive.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts amount to less than 6 percent of ESPN's 7,000
employees worldwide. Disney, the world's largest entertainment
company, has made an ongoing review of costs a crucial part of
its strategy, along with growth at its parks, media networks and
consumer products unit, to increase profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company eliminated 150 jobs from its film studio in
April and shut down video-game development in Austin, Texas, and
at the recently acquired Lucasfilm Ltd., as part of broad
efficiency effort this year. The company said May 7 that fiscal
second-quarter profit rose 32 percent to $1.51 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuts were previously reported by the sports news
website Deadspin.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.4 percent to
$65.83 at the close in New York. The stock has risen 32 percent
this year, compared with 17 percent for the Standard  Poor's
500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="May 30, 2013  4:41 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-30/disney-falls-after-rasulo-tempers-expectations-for-quarter-1-.html"><headline>Disney Falls After Rasulo Tempers Expectations for Quarter</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) fell the most in more
than a month after Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo tempered
expectations for the current quarter, citing film marketing
costs and tough comparisons with a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney, based in Burbank, California, declined
2.4 percent to $64.65 at the close in New York, the most since
April 15. The stock has gained 30 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo, speaking at a Nomura Securities investor
conference, said he was reiterating and elaborating on comments
made earlier this month that the company's film studio and theme
parks would be up against tough year-over-year comparisons in
the current fiscal third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'When I'm looking at estimates across the Street, maybe I
wasn't clear or they weren't properly reflected,' Rasulo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney will incur significant marketing costs for 'The
Lone Ranger' this quarter, while revenue from the film won't
start to flow until July 3, after the period ends, he said.
'Iron Man 3,' while collecting about $1.2 billion at the
worldwide box office, will fall short of 'Marvel's The
Avengers' from last year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those items will lower operating income at the film unit by
about $150 million from a year earlier, Rasulo said. In
addition, cable-sports channel ESPN will recognize about $75
million less in deferred revenue for the period than a year ago,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less Easter &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme-park results will reflect one less week of Easter
holiday traffic, compared with the same period last year, Rasulo
said. The company won't get the same earnings boost from the new
cruise ship Fantasy as it did a year earlier because the ship
has now been operating for more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts predict Disney will earn $1.05 a share this
quarter excluding items, the average of 29 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. They forecast sales of $11.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasulo said the company's acquisition strategy is focused
on film franchises that lead to business for other Disney units.
The 2006 purchase of the Pixar animation studio led to the
'Cars' movies, which translated into toys and theme-park
attractions. Marvel Entertainment brought 'Iron Man 3' and
'The Avengers,' which is now being spun off into a television
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This is how we like to allocate our capital,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri and Nick Turner" datetime="Nov 07, 2013  1:57 PM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-07/disney-to-create-four-series-for-netflix-using-marvel-characters.html"><headline>Disney to Create Four Series With Marvel Heroes for Netflix</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to create four
television series for Netflix Inc. (NFLX) using Marvel characters such
as Daredevil, adding to the online-streaming service's growing
lineup of original content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's Marvel TV will start bringing the shows to Netflix
in 2015, according to a statement today. They will focus on
heroes battling villains in New York's Hell's Kitchen. Netflix
committed to a minimum of four 13-episode series, culminating in
the miniseries 'The Defenders.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiyear deal extends Marvel's push into live-action
TV, following the September debut of 'Marvel's Agents of
S.H.I.E.L.D.' on Disney's ABC network. Netflix gains more
Disney content following an agreement last year for rights to
show movies including Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'What's exciting for a company like Disney and us is the
willingness to try something new,' Netflix Chief Content
Officer Ted Sarandos said Nov. 4 at the Business of
Entertainment event in Los Angeles, sponsored by Bloomberg and
the Tribeca Film Festival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is mining deeper in Marvel's library following box-office success since purchasing the comic-book company in 2009.
'Marvel's The Avengers' and 'Iron Man 3' were the top-grossing films of 2012 and 2013 respectively. 'Guardians of the
Galaxy,' about a team of superheroes in space, is planned for
next year, and an Ant-Man movie is scheduled for 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world's largest entertainment company, said fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 12 percent, beating analysts' estimates as the company's theme parks and consumer products boosted income. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income grew to $1.39 billion, or 77 cents a share, from $1.24 billion, or 68 cents, a year earlier, Disney said yesterday in a statement, topping the 76-cent average of 27 analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 7.3 percent to $11.6 billion in the period ended Sept. 28, beating the $11.4 billion average of estimates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investments in new attractions spurred higher guest spending and occupancy at Disney's U.S. resorts, letting the company increase ticket prices. Disney, based in Burbank, California, is working on 'Star Wars' rides in Orlando, Florida, and California, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger told Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There is a fair amount of development going on at Disney Imagineering right now to expand the 'Star Wars' presence in California and in Orlando, and eventually in other parks around the world,' Iger said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Profit at Disney's parks and resorts division increased 15 percent to $571 million in the quarter, as revenue grew 8.5 percent, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Thor: The Dark World,' the superhero sequel from Walt Disney Co.'s Marvel studios, placed first in U.S. and Canadian theaters this weekend, collecting $86.1 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Thor,' part of Marvel's potent constellation of box-office superheroes, faced little competition. 'Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,' the comedy from Paramount Pictures, was second in its third week, taking in $11.3 million, Rentrak Corp. said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new film outsold its 2011 predecessor, which had sales of $65.7 million in its debut.

'Iron Man 3,' released in May, is the top-grossing movie this year with $1.22 billion worldwide, with almost double the sales of 'Iron Man 2.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a trickle-down effect,' said Phil Contrino, chief analyst for researcher BoxOffice.com. 'Iron Man 3 came after it and did extremely well and now 'Thor' is benefiting too. It's a text book case of brand-building the right way.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named Jimmy Pitaro
sole president of its interactive business, assuming duties held
by John Pleasants in a shake-up less than a week after the unit
reported its second-ever quarterly profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is merging the games and media operations within
interactive as part of the change, the Burbank, California-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Pleasants, who was
co-president with Pitaro, becomes a consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is consolidating the interactive business under
a single leader after the successful introduction of the Disney
Infinity game system that Pleasants oversaw. The moves comes as
Infinity, combining collectibles with video games, gears up to
challenge the 'Skylanders' products from Activision Blizzard
Inc. during the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Disney's stated goal is to improve the profitability of
that division, and I would expect that to continue to be the
primary focus,' said Laura Martin, an analyst with Needham 
Co. in Los Angeles who has a hold rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change isn't likely to have a meaningful impact on
Disney's earnings over the next 12 months, Martin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 0.4 percent to $68.34 at the close in New York.
The stock has gained 37 percent this year, compared with 20
percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interactive Profit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interactive division posted a profit of $16 million in
the fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, as sales more than doubled to
$396 million with the release of the Infinity system, Disney
said on Nov. 7. The unit lost $76 million in the same quarter a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This successful launch drove Disney Interactive's swing
to profitability in Q4 and all indications suggest the strong
demand for Disney Infinity will continue,' Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a conference call last
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney named the two men co-presidents of interactive in
October 2010. Pitaro hailed from Yahoo! Inc.'s media unit, while
Pleasants led Playdom, a games company that was purchased by
Disney in 2010 for as much as $563 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Thor: The Dark World,' the
superhero sequel from Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Marvel studios, placed
first in U.S. and Canadian theaters this past weekend, taking in
$85.7 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Thor,' part of Marvel's potent constellation of box-office superheroes, faced little competition. 'Jackass
Presents: Bad Grandpa,' the comedy from Paramount Pictures (VIAB), was
second in its third week, collecting $11.3 million, Rentrak

&lt;p&gt;The new film outsold its 2011 predecessor, which had sales

Jeff Bock, an analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co. 'Superhero
films are the standard by which all other potential blockbusters
are measured these days.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One 'Avengers' character has already returned for a solo
spin in theaters. 'Iron Man 3,' released in May, is the top-grossing movie this year with $1.22 billion worldwide, with
almost double the sales of 'Iron Man 2.' &lt;/p&gt;

it and did extremely well and now 'Thor' is benefiting too. It's
a textbook case of brand-building the right way.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Superheroes Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debut this weekend gives 'Thor: The Dark World' the
fourth-highest domestic opening this year, behind 'Iron Man
3,' 'Man of Steel,' from Warner Bros, and 'Fast  Furious
6,' from Universal Pictures, which took in $97.4 million in its
opening in May, according to Rentrak. The film is a record for a
Disney November opening and is the biggest non-summer release
for Marvel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, acquired
Marvel, the comic book and movie company, in December 2009 for
$4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Disney said it bought the rights to the first two
'Iron Man' movies, 'Thor' and 'Captain America: The First
Avenger,' from Viacom Inc.'s Paramount. The move gives Disney
more control over Marvel's film library as it expands the
characters into its television shows and theme-park attractions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Disney said it will produce four Marvel
superhero TV series for Netflix Inc. (NFLX), the online-streaming
service, in a multiyear deal. The Burbank, California-based
company also plans a sequel to 'Captain America: The First
Avenger.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Epic Battle &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 'Thor,' Chris Hemsworth returns as the title
character. He battles to save Earth and the Nine Realms from the
Dark Elves, newly emerged from hibernation and armed with a
long-buried, universe-destroying substance. Thor's challenge is
complicated when his love interest, played by Natalie Portman,
is infected with the substance. Thor must also contend with his
scheming brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RottenTomatoes.com, a review aggregator site, gave it a 66
percent fresh rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's a review-proof movie,' said Paul Dergarabedian,
senior media analyst at Rentrak. 'Fans just want to have fun
watching it. Anytime a Marvel movie opens it's like a
behemoth.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old Vegas &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among returning films, 'Jackass,' from Paramount,
retained its second-place spot. Starring Johnny Knoxville, the
movie is the fourth since 2002 based on the 'Jackass' MTV
reality series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animated 'Free Birds' from Relativity Media placed
third, with sales of $11.1 million, up from fourth in its debut
the previous weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Last Vegas,' which follows three 60-something friends
who throw a bachelor party for their buddy, played by Michael Douglas, took fourth, down from third last weekend. It collected
$11 million for CBS films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Ender's Game,' based on the science-fiction novel about
a child warrior, dropped to fifth from first, collecting $10.3
million for Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Catching Fire,' the next installment of Lions Gate's
'The Hunger Games' franchise, is scheduled for release on Nov.
22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oscar Frontrunner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two films in limited release, '12 Years a Slave' and
'About Time,' expanded to more cinemas this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'12 Years a Slave,' from Fox Searchlight and British
director Steve McQueen, is an adaptation of an 1853 memoir by
Solomon Northup. The movie, which has drawn rave reviews,
collected $6.7 million this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'About Time,' a romantic comedy about a time traveler,
stars Domhnall Gleeson and is directed by Richard Curtis. It
took $4.8 million for Universal Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'These films have been playing for a few weeks now and
they really are starting to catch some of the multiplex magic,'
said Bock of Exhibitor Relations. ''12 Years a Slave' is going
to be a frontrunner for best picture, so it's going to be in the
top 10 for some time.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekend revenue for the top 10 films fell 1 percent to
$157.9 million from the year-earlier period, Rentrak said.
Revenue this year is up 0.4 percent to $9.07 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table has U.S. movie box-office figures
provided by studios to Rentrak. The amounts are based on gross
ticket sales for Nov. 8-10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and other movie and
TV studios have asked a federal court to dismiss their
copyright-infringement case against the file-sharing website
Lime Wire LLC and its founder, Mark Gorton, according to a Nov.
7 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studios, including Viacom Inc. (VIAB), News Corp.'s Twentieth
Century Fox Film and Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros.
Entertainment, filed the suit in federal court in New York in
February 2012. They claimed a 'staggering' amount of
infringement took place through the site, and that 'millions of
users copied billions of files using Lime Wire' without paying
anything to copyright owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lime Wire developed peer-to-peer software that let people
share digital entertainment files on their computers with other
people over the Internet. TV shows such as 'South Park' and
'Desperate Housewives' and movies including 'Avatar' and the
'Harry Potter' films were among the material allegedly
infringed, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorton operates Tower Capital Research LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that trades securities based on mathematical
algorithms it developed. 'Gorton directed and benefited from
Lime Wire's inducement of infringement,' the entertainment
companies said in one of their filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in May 2010 found Lime Wire
and Gorton liable for inducing infringement of copyrights for
recorded music. The site was shut down by an October 2010 court
order. Lime Wire settled with the recording industry for $105
million in May 2011 during a trial in Manhattan to determine
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No terms for the settlement of the case brought by the
studios were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Lime Wire
LLC, 12-cv-00818, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earlier case is Arista Records LLC v. Lime Wire LLC,
06-cv-05936, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Piggy Pushers' Sock Patent Not Infringed, Appeals Court Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court affirmed a lower-court ruling that
a patent wasn't infringed based on its understanding of the
difference between a sock and a shoe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, filed in a Michigan federal court in July 2010,
was between two makers of footwear for infants. Piggy Pushers of
Holland, Michigan, claimed that products made by Skidders
Footwear Inc. infringed patent 6,385,779. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent covers a sock for a crawling infant. According
to the patent, which was issued in May 2002, the sock has a
gripper element in both the upper and lower surface that
increases friction and makes it possible for a baby to crawl on
slippery surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product made by New York-based Skidders has a foot-surrounding sock bonded to a rubber outsole. In May 2012 the
lower court said there was nothing in the language of the patent
that could suggest the inventor meant 'sock' to mean anything
other than the ordinary definition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court said the Skidders products had a number of
differences from socks, including having a durable outsole, and
left- and right-foot designations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its Nov. 8 ruling, the Washington-based U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the lower court was
correct. Piggy Pushers, the court said, failed to present
evidence refuting Skidders' claim that its product didn't fit
the definition of a sock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is Piggy Pushers LLC v. Skidders Footwear LLC,
2013-1107, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Piggy Pushers LLC v. Skidders
Footwear Inc., 1:10-cv-00644, U.S. District Court, Western
District of Michigan (Grand Rapids). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Furuno Complaint Against Garmin, Navico to Be Investigated &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission said Nov. 8 that it
will investigate a complaint filed in September by Furuno
Electric Co. (6814) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hygo, Japan-based  Furuno said that GPS, navigation and
radar devices made by Garmin Ltd., Navico Holdings A/S and Flir
Systems Inc.'s Raymarine unit infringe four patents. Furuno is
seeking an import ban against all three companies' devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The devices are used in cars, airplanes and ships. The
patents cover systems, devices and methods for improving
navigation, radar and map displays, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based ITC has the power to exclude the
importation of items that infringe U.S. patents. Last week the
commission also said that it would investigate a complaint
Navico made against Flir fish-finding devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dunlop's Cleveland Golf Unit Sues Callaway Over Golf Club Name &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunlop Sports Co. (7825)'s Roger Cleveland Golf unit sued Callaway
Golf Co. (ELY) for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in Santa Ana, California,
is related to the use of the phrase 'Designed by Roger
Cleveland' on some of Callaway's golf clubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Roger Cleveland founded the
Roger Cleveland Golf Co. in 1979. The company owns a number of
trademark registrations for 'Cleveland' and 'Cleveland
Golf.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland left the company in 1995 and, according to court
papers, departed with no rights in or to the Cleveland
trademarks. He went to work for rival Callaway, where he is now
chief of golf club design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2013, Callaway began marketing a club bearing Roger
Cleveland's name, the Roger Cleveland Mac Daddy 2. Roger
Cleveland Golf said consumers have been confused by Callaway's
use of the name, and that, to no avail, it has sent cease-and-desist notices to Carlsbad, California-based Callaway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It asked the court to bar Callaway's use of the Cleveland
name, and for awards of money damages, including profits
attributable to the alleged infringement, together with attorney
fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callaway didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request
for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Roger Cleveland Golf Co. v. Callaway Golf Co.,
8:13-cv-01642, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Famous Jameis' Trademark Filing Is Made by Alabama Football Fan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Alabama football fan has applied to register the phrase
'Famous Jameis' as a trademark. The phrase has been used to
describe Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston,
the Heisman Trophy favorite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mukul Mehra, 40, filed the trademark request on Oct. 24,
according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehra said in a telephone interview he has no connection to
Winston, a redshirt freshman from Bessemer, Alabama, a suburb of
Birmingham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's not necessarily geared toward him,' said Mehra, who
has a medical degree from the University of Alabama School of
Medicine in Birmingham. 'I don't know what our intent
completely is. We haven't worked all of that out.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Deese, a partner at the Washington law firm Arent
Fox, said in a telephone interview that Winston probably would
be awarded the trademark if he moved to register it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We would hope the examiner is savvy enough to recognize
that Famous Jameis refers to the potential Heisman Trophy
winner,' said Deese, whose clients include Houston Rockets
guard Jeremy Lin. 'You can't register a trademark for somebody
else's name without their permission, which is what happened
with Jeremy.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mehra said he has contacted a local sports marketing
company about producing 'Famous Jameis' T-shirts. He also said
he's open to a partnership with Winston or Florida State. 'If
it's something they're interested in using we could potentially
market it together,' Mehra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6-foot-4, 228-pound Winston, at -500, is the favorite
at sportsbook.com to win the Heisman Trophy, which is given
annually to college football's best player. A $50 bet would win
$10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winston has completed 149 of 212 passes for 2,502 yards and
24 touchdowns, fifth in college football's top level. He's also
thrown six interceptions and run for three touchdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deese said it would behoove Winston to move quickly on the
trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The longer you wait, the more costly it gets,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second AIDS Group Vies for Defunct Charity's Mark, Blade Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second AIDS-related charity has made an offer to buy the
trademark of the now-defunct National Association of People with
AIDS, the Washington Blade reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based Community Education Group made an
offer to the bankruptcy court buy to buy the trademark rights to
six different names, the Blade reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marks include 'National HIV Testing Day,' 'National
Gay Men's Awareness Day,' 'National Gay Men's HIV/AIDS
Awareness Day, ''Healthy Living Summit'' and ''AIDS Watch,''
according to the Blade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Health HIV, also based in Washington, offered
$3,000 for the rights to just one of the marks, ''National Gay
Men's HIV/AIDS Awareness Day,'' according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Yorkers Charged Over Fake Polo, Lacoste Clothes, WABC Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six New York residents have been charged with trademark
counterfeiting and conspiracy, WABC-TV reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were accused of selling versions of Ralph Loren
Corp. (RL)'s Polo, Lacoste SA, VF Inc. (VFC)'s North Face, and True
Religion Apparel Inc.'s clothing with a suggested retail price
of more than $13.4 million to smaller distributors, according to
the New York-based television station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges followed the seizure of more than 2,000 boxes
of counterfeit trademarked clothing from a storage facility in
Queens, New York, in July, WABC-TV reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly told
WABC-TV that this counterfeit-clothing operation was of
particular importance because of indications that the proceeds
went to areas in southern Lebanon that were ''of concern' to
the intelligence bureau. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Chandler-Saunders buys Doc McStuffins toys because the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) character teaches her two-year-old daughter to care for others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'My daughter fell in love with Doc right away,' said Chandler-Saunders, who nabbed a $35 Doc McStuffins medical kit from Toys 'R' Us Inc. after the toy topped her daughter's Christmas list. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dottie 'Doc' McStuffins, a six-year-old aspiring physician who treats her toys with help from her dragon and snowman friends, is making most-popular lists this season. The doll is already flying off store shelves, say retailers, which sell about $10 billion worth of toys in the fourth quarter or about half the annual total, according to researcher NPD. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on 'Doc McStuffins,' Disney Junior channel's animated hit show, the dolls are vying with toys inspired by Viacom Inc. (VIAB)'s Dora The Explorer character, long the undisputed queen of the toddler set. For parents like Chandler-Saunders, Doc's skin color enhances the appeal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm Caucasian, and the doll is black, so it's kind of cool kids can look up to someone' of another race, said the 35-year-old mother of two, who runs her own insurance agency in Jetersville, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doc McStuffins's rapid ascent since debuting last year is something of a departure for an industry that has a tendency to reboot old brands. Exhibit A: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which debuted in the 1980s and was revived last year as a line of toys and a Nickelodeon series, is a top pick for boys this year, according to hot-toy lists. Another familiar friend is Hasbro Inc. (HAS)'s Big Hugs Elmo, the latest incarnation of the fuzzy Sesame Street character, which industry analysts predict also will be a top seller this holiday-shopping season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Insufficient Inventory &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, McStuffins's popularity took some retailers by surprise, leaving them with insufficient inventory, said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of toy review website Time to Play. The shortage prompted moms to hit websites such as EBay Inc. (EBAY) where they spent double the toy's $10 retail price, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney's stock rose 0.4 percent to $70.20 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 41 percent this year, while the Standard  Poor's 500 Index has advanced 27 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year retailers are prepared. Disney's top four U.S. retail accounts, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), Target Corp., Toys 'R' Us and Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)'s Kmart, have on average quadrupled the shelf space given to McStuffins from last holidays, said J.D. Edwards, senior vice president of licensing for Disney Consumer Products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Quick Greenlight &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doc McStuffins appeals to a wide range of demographics, said Jennifer Dominiquini, Sears chief marketing officer for fitness, sporting goods and toys. 'It addresses that human need for nurturing. It's a perfect recipe for success.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Disney executives were pitched Doc McStuffins in 2008, they greenlighted the show quickly because it introduced the concept of nurturing to children's television. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It was almost like one of those 'duh why didn't we think of this before' moments,' said Nancy Kanter, executive vice president of original programming and general manager of Disney Junior Worldwide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company made one key switch: changing the family's race from white to black. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Diverse Brand &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's important to us that the brand and the content represents the world as kids live it and see it and that is a world that's very diverse,' Kanter said. 'Just the notion that for some kids this will look exactly like their families and for others it will look like what they see in their neighborhoods.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, Disney added a range of accessories, including clothes, bedding and even Doc McStuffins Band-Aids from Johnson  Johnson. The company is also releasing toys aimed at boys, including a blue rather than pink check-up kit because the show's viewers are almost evenly split between boys and girls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The brand's growth helped more than double retail sales of Disney Junior products to $1.8 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 28, Edwards said. He declined to give specific data for Doc McStuffins. Success in the toy division is important to Disney because the unit generates high-margin sales on characters already created by other businesses. Consumer products accounted for 10 percent of profit in the most recent fiscal year, while making up 7.9 percent of total company sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Toy Fads &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hot holiday toys come and go. That's why toymakers rush to add bells and whistles to keep kids interested. In September, for example, Viacom released the Dora Sizzling Surprises Kitchen and Spin  Skate Dora and Boots. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Ten years running Dora remains a beloved property and is doing very well for us this holiday,' said Dan Martinsen, a spokesman for Viacom's Nickelodeon networks. 'Dora continues to be a trailblazer and has a long, bright future ahead of her.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, Doc's race and her TV family's reversal of gender roles -- mom is a doctor; dad stays home -- has strong appeal for some parents, said Laurie Schacht, chief executive officer of 'The Toy Book,' a trade publication. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It makes it more real, and more interesting,' she said. 'Whether we're talking about color or women, everyone has come a long way, and it's nice to see that in our kids .' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such distinctions are beside the point for toddlers, who relate to the story and character -- not what makes adults feel good, said Nancy Zwiers, a former marketing executive for Mattel Inc. Parents' discomfort with sexy Bratz fashion dolls didn't prevent MGA Entertainment Co. from building a billion-dollar business. The Barbie brand hasn't suffered from complaints that the doll's unrealistic proportions may hurt girls' self-esteem. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Emotional Choices &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We adults like to overlay our perspective on things, and that's not the way kids make choices,' said Zwiers, who now does brand consulting for toy and entertainment companies, including Disney. 'Kids are making choices emotionally.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doc McStuffins, who once soothed a bubble bottle character's stomach ache after it was accidentally filled with paste instead of soap, is seen as a role model. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She 'teaches manners and how to be respectful and how to be nice toward others,' said Chandler-Saunders. 'That's hard to teach children.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri and Alex Sherman" datetime="Oct 01, 2013  4:19 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-01/disney-dish-talks-said-to-hinge-on-ad-skipping-new-nets.html"><headline>Disney-Dish Talks Said to Hinge on Ad Skipping, New Nets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s contract renewal
talks with Dish Network Corp. (DISH) are hung up on Dish's ad-skipping
technology and terms for two new Disney cable channels,
according to people familiar with the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV service, and
Disney, owner of ABC, ESPN and Disney Channel, gave themselves
one to two days beyond yesterday's deadline to hammer out an
accord, said the people, who sought anonymity because the
discussions are private. Talks may last longer, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish's AutoHop technology, introduced in May 2012, presents
a obstacle to a deal. The one-button feature allows subscribers
to skip commercials on recorded broadcast TV shows, undermining
the effectiveness of network ads. Dish is embroiled in
litigation with ABC, CBS Corp. (CBS), Comcast Corp.'s NBC and 21st
Century Fox Inc.'s Fox over the feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, is also trying to
build distribution for two new channels -- Fusion, a venture
with Univision Communications Inc. aimed at Hispanics, and the
SEC Network, which will feature Southeastern Conference college
sports beginning next year. Terms for both are being negotiated,
the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, and Disney said
yesterday they agreed to a 'short-term' extension of their
agreement, which was due to expire Sept. 30. The deal prevented
a blackout of ESPN and the Disney Channel for Dish subscribers,
including ABC viewers in markets where Disney owns the stations,
such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. (DISH) and Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) reached a short-term extension of their programming
agreement, averting a blackout of Disney channels including ESPN
and ABC while the parties negotiate a long-term deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the extension weren't disclosed, Englewood,
Colorado-based Dish, the third-largest U.S. pay-TV service in
total subscribers, said yesterday in a joint statement with
Burbank, California-based Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension temporarily prevents a blackout of ESPN, the
Disney Channel and some ABC stations for millions of pay-TV
subscribers. More than 3 million Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)
customers lost CBS Corp. (CBS) programming for a month before those
two companies agreed to a new retransmission contract on Sept.
2. Dish has about 14 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish Chairman and co-founder Charlie Ergen has lamented the
rising cost of sports programming for several years. He
suggested last month a pay-TV company may one day choose to go
without the top-rated all-sports channel -- a strategy that
would lower prices to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN charges pay-TV operators about $5.54 a month per
subscriber, according to research firm SNL Kagan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Somebody, sometime may decide that sports isn't something
they have to have,' Ergen said on a conference call in August.
'There could be a day when, strategically, companies just can't
get together, where they go opposite directions and they both
have strategies that work for them, and we're prepared to go
either way.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SEC Network &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extension affects ESPN, Disney Channel and ABC stations
owned by Disney in markets including New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago. Disney also is trying to build distribution for a new
channel, the SEC Network, that will feature Southeastern
Conference college sports in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish rose 1.1 percent to $45.50 at 11:28 a.m. in New York.
The shares had gained 24 percent this year through yesterday.
Disney, up 30 percent in 2013, climbed 1 percent to $65.14

&lt;p&gt;Broadcast networks have been raising prices for so-called
retransmission rights -- fees paid by pay-TV services to carry
signals that are available free over government airwaves.
Content owners are also seeking to boost revenue from mobile
devices that extend delivery of their shows beyond the home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the earlier dispute, New York-based Time Warner Cable
agreed to pay a significant increase for the right to carry CBS,
approaching $2 per subscriber per month, people with knowledge
of the situation said in early September. Time Warner Cable
failed to obtain out-of-home rights for mobile devices, except
for CBS's Showtime Anytime, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. plans to appoint a
chief operating officer next year, establishing an heir apparent
to Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger, a person with knowledge
of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest entertainment company is weighing
internal candidates for the position, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because board deliberations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri" datetime="Oct 03, 2014  4:24 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="h" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-03/disney-extends-iger-term-keeps-staggs-rasulo-race-alive.html"><headline>Disney Extends Iger Term, Keeps Staggs-Rasulo Race Alive</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s board found a way
to keep Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger in place
until 2018 while maximizing the chances the internal candidates
most likely to succeed him stick around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, yesterday extended
Iger's contract by two years to June 2018. The move keeps in
place a manager who has spearheaded high-profile acquisitions
like Marvel, turned around the company's historic animation
business and tripled Disney's stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the company has decided to name a chief
operating officer next year -- and that executive, most likely
coming from within, would be Iger's heir apparent, according to
a person close to the company. Giving a time frame to the
internal candidates, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and
Parks  Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs, makes them less likely
to bolt before a decision is made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There's no doubt Bob Iger has been performing at an
outstanding level,' said William Simon, an executive recruiter
who heads the entertainment industry practice at Korn Ferry (KFY) in
Los Angeles. 'Asking a potential successor to wait four years
could prove to be difficult.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a filing today that Iger could earn a
retention bonus of $60 million if Disney's operating income
increases to a cumulative $78.3 billion for the five years
ending in September 2018. He will earn a smaller bonus if that
number tops $76 billion. For the year that ended in September
2013, the company generated operating income of $10.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chile's economy will grow less than
the central bank and government forecast next year as it emerges
from the 'Disneyland' of high copper prices and low global
borrowing costs, said a former head of the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in the world's largest copper
producer will expand 3.5 percent to 4 percent, compared with the
4.9 percent forecast by the government, said Vittorio Corbo,
senior investigator at Santiago-based think-tank Centro de
Estudios Publicos. The central bank is estimating growth of 4
percent to 5 percent next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We've had three very good years,' said Corbo, who was
president of the central bank between 2003 and 2007, in an
interview in Santiago yesterday. 'They were chasing Chilean
companies to lend them money. We were in Disneyland, but from
here on conditions won't be the same.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surging investment in the mining industry that has enabled
economic growth to average 5.8 percent in the past three years
is set to weaken as rising costs and falling prices crimp profit
margins, said Corbo, who is a director of Banco Santander SA. A
three-year boom in consumer spending will also peter out soon,
paving the way for an interest rate cut before the end of the
year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'In the next few years, Chile will have to work hard in
order to grow and even to maintain an expansion of 4.5
percent,' he said. 'Everything points to one or two rate cuts
in the next six to 12 months.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling From the Sky &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Sebastian Pinera told Charlie Rose in an
interview aired on PBS and Bloomberg Television that Chile can
maintain growth of 6 percent as long as it doesn't rest on its
past achievements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'You have to be taking measures all the time to innovate,
to improve, to modernize the whole system,' Pinera said. 'So
the worst danger is when you think that growth happens by
chance, or falls from the sky.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four pillars of growth will be education, innovation,
science and poverty reduction, Pinera said, comments that echoed
Corbo's list of areas the government needs to concentrate on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal risk for Chile's economy next year remains a
sudden slowdown in China and subsequent slump in copper prices,
Corbo said. The end of quantitative easing in the U.S. could
also push up global borrowing costs, draining funds from
emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interest Rates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile's central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate
at 5 percent for the past 20 months as a forecast slowdown in
consumer spending failed to materialize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales leaped 12 percent in August from the year
earlier, bringing growth in the year to date to 10.2 percent,
the National Institute of Statistics said Sept. 30.
Manufacturing production stagnated over the same period,
creating a 'dichotomy' for policy makers, the central bank
said in the minute of its September rate meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'With the figures from this week the central bank has
additional arguments to wait some more, but it isn't going to
wait long,' Corbo said. 'The bank will continue to be prudent
and from here to the end of the year it is possible we will have
the first rate cut.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-year swaps were unchanged at 4.67 percent today, as
traders priced in a rate cut as soon as Oct. 17. Once reduced,
rates won't be coming back up again soon, Corbo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Slowing Down &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With real wage growth slowing and consumer sentiment
weakening, policy makers may cut rates even before retail sales
start to ease, central bank President Rodrigo Vergara said Oct.
1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If we have evidence of a relatively strong slowdown in
coming months, we could take monetary policy decisions even if
the current information isn't showing the symptoms,' Vergara
said. The debate on consumer demand shouldn't dominate rate
decisions, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbo echoed Vergara's confidence that the retail sales
boom will end soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The labor market is going to be less dynamic,' he said.
'It is strange that consumption hasn't slowed as we expected,
but it should start to do it soon.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chile may not be as vulnerable as policy makers had thought
to a withdrawal of foreign funds as the current account
stabilizes at about 4 percent of GDP, Corbo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaker internal demand, led by a slowdown in investment in
the mining industry, may provide a 'positive surprise' for the
current account deficit, which is currently forecast to end the
year at about 4 percent of GDP, Vergara said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corbo put a number on the changed outlook for the broadest
measure of trade in goods and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The 4.8 percent current account deficit the central bank
is forecasting for 2014 is very unlikely,' Corbo said 'It will
be close to 4 percent.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AOL Inc. (AOL), the owner of the Huffington Post and TechCrunch, signed a syndication agreement with Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ESPN cable network in a bid for a bigger foothold in video advertising. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ESPN will grant AOL syndication rights and join the digital publisher's online video-programming network that already includes the Wall Street Journal, Sports Illustrated and 1,700 other publishers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong is seeking to transform the company into a content publisher driven by advertising. Online video commands higher ad rates than traditional Web placements, and marketers are increasingly looking for more outlets to run promotions. Spending on digital-video ads is projected to increase 41 percent to $4.09 billion in the U.S. this year, according to EMarketer Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Advertisers tell us there isn't enough quality inventory, and we're working fast to deliver that,' Ran Harnevo, the head of AOL's video unit, said in an interview. What sets AOL apart from other digital-video networks is its 'high-quality' content, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, ESPN can sell short commercials that run at the start of each video clip, with both AOL and ESPN sharing in the revenue. Publishers participating in AOL's network can feature ESPN's video content on their sites also receive a cut of any advertising buys. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Content Strategy &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;AOL's ad business makes up more than two-thirds of sales, and its video network had 71.2 million viewers in August, second to Google Inc. (GOOG)'s 167 million, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR) AOL's video audience is less than half of Google's, underscoring the need to boost the amount of available video content. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company's video strategy has become more important as it cuts back on other content initiatives. It recently faced setbacks with its hyper-local news service Patch. The company eliminated about 500 positions and said in August it could shutter as many as 20 percent of its over 900 Patch websites. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result of the deal, ESPN will become the anchor provider of sports-related content for AOL's network, which also includes news, entertainment, travel and auto -- categories advertisers typically buy into. Harnevo said AOL is currently talking to other video partners for longer-form content as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AOL shares declined 1.2 percent to $32.50 at 11:46 a.m. in New York. The stock gained 11 percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Crayton Harrison" datetime="Oct 15, 2013 10:09 AM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-15/disney-recommends-rejecting-mini-tender-offer-below-market-value.html"><headline>Disney Recommends Rejecting Mini-Tender Offer Below Market Value</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) recommended that
investors reject an offer to buy a small portion of its stock
for 4.7 percent below market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has warned
against such mini-tender offers, which bidders use to 'catch
investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer
price to the current market price,' Disney said today in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRC Capital Corp., a closely held investment firm, made the
proposal last week to acquire about 2 million Disney shares for
$61 apiece. Toronto-based TRC has made similar offers this year
for Intel Corp. (INTC) and 21st Century Fox Inc. shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, slid 1.2 percent to
$66.03 at 9:55 a.m. in New York. The shares closed at $64 on
Oct. 8, the day before TRC made its mini-tender offer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rackspace Hosting Inc. (RAX) lawyer Van
Lindberg is fed up with what he considers dubious patent-infringement lawsuits -- such licensing company Rotatable
Technologies LLC's demand for $75,000 to settle a February case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies negotiate to pay the plaintiff to go away,
since it's cheaper than what may become a lengthy court battle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a procedure called inter partes review created by the
2011 America Invents Act, Lindberg instead petitioned the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office for a new examination of the
computer-image display patent. If Rackspace persuades the agency
the patent never should have been issued, the suit will be
dismissed. Rotatable says in court documents its patent is
valid. Its lawyer, Austin Hansley in Dallas, didn't return calls
seeking comment on the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We said, 'No thanks'' to Rotatable's demand, said
Lindberg, head of the intellectual property section of the San
Antonio-based Web computing services provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Google Inc., NetApp Inc. (NTAP) and Oracle
Corp. (ORCL) see the new review as a way to fend off royalty demands by
patent-assertion entities -- sometimes derided as trolls. They
like the process for the reasons patent-licensing firms don't:
they offer quicker rulings at less cost than litigation and
shift the burden of proof to patent owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech companies say patent lawsuits -- especially targeting
end users or one aspect of a business -- drain resources and
innovation. Patent-licensing companies say litigation protects
inventions, though Congress is considering curbs on abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 592 petitions have been filed since reviews began
a year ago, exceeding the 520 the agency expected. Two cases
were decided as of Oct. 3, as the patent office stayed open
during the partial government shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new patent law, the Arlington, Virginia-based
patent office set up processes to look at some finance-related
business methods, such as SAP AG (SAP)'s challenge of Versata Software
Inc.'s patent for customized pricing, and to streamline the
older procedure for anyone challenging a patent's validity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions on whether a patent is valid are required within
12 months. Patent reexaminations under the old rules ordinarily
can take years. Patent office officials had no comment for this
story, said Paul Fucito, an agency spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Luxury-Goods Makers Win Order Against Tradekey's Websites &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartier International, Montblanc-Simplo GmbH, Alfred
Dunhill Ltd. and three other manufacturers of luxury goods
persuaded a federal judge in Los Angeles to issue an order
against a company that enabled the sale of counterfeit goods
through three different websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Gary Allen Fees said Oct. 8 he would
issue an order barring Tradekey Pvt. Ltd. from permitting the
use of any of the plantiffs' trademarks or imitation of their
marks on the www.Tradekey.com, www.saudicommerce.com and
www.b2bfreezone.com websites. He also said the company wouldn't
be able to use the plaintiffs' marks as keywords, adwords or any
other type of metadata. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit began in May 2011 in federal court in Los Angeles.
The luxury goods companies hired an investigator who found that
6,000 sellers were offering unauthorized versions of the
plaintiffs' goods on Tradekey websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigator bought counterfeit products falsely
branded as made by Cartier and the other defendants from sellers
who were promoting their goods on Tradekey websites, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also paid a $3,000 fee for a Tradekey membership through
which he purported to want to sell counterfeit merchandise.
According to court papers, the Tradekey employee told the
investigator that it wasn't a problem selling fakes through the
websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradekey had argued that the investigation process was
sloppy and unreliable. The court said that it was worth nothing
that the investigators in the case had a 'substantial track
record' in federal court litigation, and that evidence the
investigator produced in the past 'has been relied on by
multiple courts finding in favor of the famous plaintiff brand
owners such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Microsoft, Gucci and
others.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chloe SAS v. Sawabeh Information Services Co.,
2:11-cv-04147-GAF-MAN, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'Escape From Tomorrow' Filmmakers Waiting for Disney Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official website for the black-and-white film 'Escape
From Tomorrow' contains a digital clock counting down the
weeks, days, hours and minutes since the film's release that its
producers haven't been sued by the Walt Disney Co. (DIS) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film, shot clandestinely inside the Disney theme parks
in Florida and California, was shown at the Sundance Festival
and went into general release earlier this month. The film
trailer opens with the message, 'The following motion picture
has not been approved for all audiences by the Walt Disney
Company.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roy Abramsohn, who plays the lead role in the film, was
interviewed in a 'behind the scenes' video available on Google
Inc. (GOOG)'s YouTube video-sharing website. Abramson said that he and
his fellow actors were 'hiding in plain sight' when shooting
the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Randy Moore said in that same video that filming
in the park wasn't all that difficult because 'everyone brings
in camera equipment' and is shooting videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film's trailer features background shots of many of the
iconic Disney theme park attractions, including the swirling
teacup ride, Sleeping Beauty's castle, the flying Dumbo elephant
ride, the Epcot sphere and the 'Small World' family ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the posters for the film contains an image of the
four-fingered gloved hand associated with Mickey Mouse. Blood
drips from all four fingers. Another shows two women running
from what seems to be a giant eye centered by the Epcot sphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was scored by Abel Korzeniowski, instead of using
familiar Disney theme music, such as the accompaniment to the
Small World ride, and the background music to the jungle-themed
Tiki Room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was done in an attempt to sidestep any possible
copyright claims, according to an article by Peter Sciretta on
the SlashFilm.com website. Sciretta's piece, posted in January
after the film's debut at the Sundance Festival, predicted that
'Escape From Tomorrow' would never go into general release
because of the number of potential intellectual-property issues
Disney lawyers could raise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Intel Sued, Accused of Trade Secret Misappropriation by Zettaset &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zettaset, a maker of database-management software and
systems, filed a trade-secrets misappropriation case against
Intel Corp. (INTC) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed Oct. 10 in California state court,
accuses the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker of
extracting trade secrets from Zettaset's products and
technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California's Zettaset said in a statement
yesterday that the misappropriation was so extensive that an
Intel product -- Apache Hadoop Software -- 'now mirrors the
features and functionality of Zettaset's Orchestrator
software.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zettaset President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Vogt
said in the statement that the company had 'no alternative but
to take legal action.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel spokesman Chuck Malloy said in an e-mail that his
company is aware of the suit and 'in the process of developing
our defense.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Zettaset, a pretrial conference for the
dispute has been set for Feb. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Zettaset v. Intel Corp., 1-13-cv-254447,
California Superior Court, Santa Clara County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) rose the most in
almost two weeks, reaching an all-time high as investors bet
rising fees from pay-television services will extend gains for
media stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest entertainment company gained
2.1 percent to $69 at the close in New York, eclipsing the May
15 all-time closing high of $67.67. The stock is up 39 percent
for the year, compared with 23 percent for the Standard  Poor's
500 Index (SPX), which closed at a record 1,754.67 today, and 38
percent for the SP 500 Media Index of 16 stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entertainment companies including Disney, Viacom Inc. (VIAB) and
CBS Corp. (CBS) are benefiting from the increasing fees they are able
to charge pay-television services for their broadcast and cable
shows. Analysts project shares of Disney, the owner of theme
parks, TV networks and film studios, will reach $72.46 within 12
months, the average of 24 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. CBS
and 21st Century Fox Inc. also made new highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney's profit is forecast to increase 9 percent to $1.36
billion, or 75 cents a share, in the just-ended fourth quarter,
the average of 19 analysts' estimates. The company, based in
Burbank, California, reports results after markets close on Nov.
7. Of 34 analysts who rate the stock, 21 recommend buying, while
11 say hold and one says sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit growth stalled at $1.85 billion, or $1.01 a share,
in the third quarter ended June 29, crimped by costs to market
the July film 'The Lone Ranger,' higher TV programming
expenses and lower ratings at the ABC network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said last month that it may double its stock
purchases to $8 billion next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cash Flow &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the buyback cost will exceed discretionary cash flow,
Standard  Poor's said in a Sept. 12 report that the company
will be able to maintain its A corporate credit rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Disney remains the preeminent company for monetizing
intellectual property across a breadth of businesses,' Naveen Sarma, a credit analyst at SP, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buyback comes as capital spending shrinks from a peak
of $3.78 billion in fiscal 2012. In recent years, Disney has
expanded parks in California and Florida, built cruise ships and
developed a resort in Hawaii. A new destination in Shanghai is
scheduled to open at the end of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on projects and acquisitions will continue, Chief
Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said in September, citing as
examples Marvel, Lucasfilm and purchases in games and
international TV networks. The company is interested in deals
that increase its distribution capability, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hulu LLC, the video-streaming site
owned by three media companies, named Elaine Paul, a Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) executive, as its chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul replaces Tom Fuelling, Hulu Chief Executive Officer
Mike Hopkins said today in a blog post. Paul was involved in
Disney's original investment in Hulu in 2009 and was senior vice
president of corporate strategy at Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hulu, which offers a free, ad-supported service and the
$7.99-a-month Hulu Plus, with more shows available on more
devices, is owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox Inc. and Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal. Hopkins, a former Fox executive, was named
CEO of Hulu last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that CBS Corp. has prevailed in its monthlong dispute with Time Warner Cable Inc., it's Bob Iger's turn to see how much his Walt Disney Co. can squeeze from a pay-TV carrier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, owner of the most-expensive pay-TV channel in ESPN, faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reach a new agreement with Dish Network Corp. (DISH), the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV provider. The negotiations cover how much Dish pays for content and whether it can put programs on mobile phones -- the same sticking points that led to the one-month blackout of CBS on Time Warner Cable systems that was resolved this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The outcome of those talks bodes well for Iger, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, and other content owners. CBS CEO Leslie Moonves won significant price increases while holding on to digital rights. Disney especially is buoyed by ownership of sports network ESPN -- a must-have for pay-TV providers like Dish, which are struggling to keep expenses in check while online players such as Netflix Inc. siphon viewers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Even grandmas watch a lot of sports, so it will be difficult for Dish,' Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities in Denver, said in an interview.

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) sold an estimated $30 million of its Infinity game system in the two weeks after the product's Aug. 18 debut, ranking among the top sellers, according to Michael J. Olson, a Piper Jaffray  Co. analyst. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shoppers bought 400,000 units, Olson said in a research note published today. First-week spending matched the debut of Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI)'s Skylanders Giants game, Olson said in an earlier note. That title was the top 2012 holiday children's game, according to Activision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Sales have been excellent, beyond our expectations,' said Richard Barry, chief merchandising officer at Toys 'R' Us Inc., based in Wayne, New Jersey. 'Kids are really engaging in the brand. They are not only buying the software, but they are really engaging in the characters and the power discs.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infinity represents Disney's biggest bet in video games, drawing on characters like Captain Jack Sparrow from its library of film hits. The company is counting on the product and follow-on sales to turn a profit at its interactive division, which lost $103 million through nine months of the current fiscal year. First-week purchases totaled 379,000, Olson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Skylanders, Infinity integrates collectible figures with on-screen video-game play. Kids use the figures to create and play with characters using game consoles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Disney Infinity is having meaningful success at retail,' Olson wrote in the earlier note. Clerks said the game is 'selling very well' in 17 of 20 stores checked, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney, the world's largest entertainment company, rose 0.3 percent to $61.59 at the close in New York. Shares of the Burbank, California-based company are up 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Infinity product, including a base unit and three collectible characters, retails for $75. Additional toys and discs, providing more characters and features, sell for $5 to $13. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Lucas Shaw and Anousha Sakoui" datetime="Sep 11, 2014 10:17 AM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-11/fox-disney-said-to-weigh-joining-sony-s-web-tv-service.html"><headline>Disney, Fox Weigh Joining Sony's Web-TV Service</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and 21st Century Fox Inc. are in discussions to supply Sony Corp. (6758) with programming for its planned Internet-based TV service, according to people familiar with the conversations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney and Fox would join Viacom Inc. (VIAB), which said yesterday it will provide 22 networks, the first time the media company, headed by Chairman Sumner Redstone, has made its shows available for a Web-based service. The deal covers live and on-demand programming, Viacom and Sony said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony's service will debut with 'major programmers,' according to yesterday's statement. The company wouldn't specify when, or identify potential partners. No deal with Disney or Fox is imminent, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Sony shares rose. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Sony is clearly beefing up content offerings for its growth plans for its Entertainment Network division, recently merged with its gaming unit,' Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Television, telephone and technology companies are exploring cable-like packages streamed over the Internet to reach younger viewers who aren't signing up for traditional cable and satellite TV. Progress has been slow. Intel Corp. (INTC) abandoned a planned Web-TV service this year. Dish Network Corp. (DISH) secured rights to carry Disney channels like ESPN in an online package separate from its satellite-TV business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Verizon Plans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. is planning an Internet-based offering by mid-2015 after acquiring the supporting technology from Intel Corp. earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam said today at a Goldman Sachs conference in New York. Verizon's mobile-video-streaming technology could let it offer live video from major broadcasters along with on-demand programming, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Viacom deal with Sony took a more than a year to complete after a preliminary accord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It'll benefit every party in the ecosystem we have all enjoyed,' Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman said yesterday at the Goldman Sachs conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dauman praised the 'elegant consumer interface' of Sony's service and said the Tokyo-based company was a natural partner given the popularity of its gaming devices among the young viewers who watch Viacom's cable channels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA), Time Warner Inc. (TWX) and Starz are also among the companies discussing offering their programs through Sony, the New York Times reported earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Numerous Partners &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The service will launch with numerous major network partners, but we aren't providing specifics at this time including who we are speaking to,' Sean Yoneda, a spokesman for Sony in the U.S., said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chris LaPlaca, a spokesman for Disney's ESPN, declined to say whether the network was speaking to Sony. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We remain platform agnostic and are always looking for new and innovative ways to serve our fans, consistent with the approach we are taking with our current distribution partners,' LaPlaca said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nathaniel Brown, a spokesman for Fox (FOXA), declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The partnership announced yesterday unites more than 75 million Internet-enabled Sony devices in U.S. homes with Viacom's programming, Sony said. Viewers can watch shows such as 'SpongeBob SquarePants' and 'Teen Wolf' on TVs, game consoles and Blu-ray players. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Boosting Investment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai has boosted investment in content production and TV networks as he pushes his 'One Sony' vision to unite products, including mobile devices and TVs, with games, music and films as it competes against Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world's biggest maker of phones and televisions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony shares rose 2.7 percent to 2,105 yen at the close in Tokyo. The company's American depositary receipts climbed 1.2 percent to $19.74 at 10:14 a.m. in New York. Viacom shares were little changed at $79.86. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A good lineup is important for this service because users will choose a service with a lot of content,' said Hideki Yasuda, a Tokyo-based analyst at Ace Research Institute. 'It's also a way for Sony to differentiate itself from Samsung.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Viacom owns and operates the largest basic-cable portfolio in the U.S. by audience share, said Sony, citing Nielsen data. The cloud-based TV service will stream Comedy Central, VH1 and Spike, among others, as well as Viacom's full video-on-demand package. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal earlier this year with Burbank, California-based Disney gave Dish, Charlie Ergen's satellite-TV company, rights to carry the Disney Channel, ABC and ESPN. That put Dish ahead of Sony in the race to become the first to offer a service known as over-the-top, or OTT, because it runs over an Internet connection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;OTT Stalled &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negotiations for the right to stream popular TV channels have slowed the development of every planned OTT service, because distributors need a minimum number of channels to offer a product robust enough to compete with traditional pay-TV. Every major TV programmer has explored such deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'What they are trying to do is figure out a way to get younger consumers and some cohorts that are not obviously going to subscribe to big packages and bundles of channels, and give them really an on-ramp to starting in the experience of subscribing and getting something that fits them,' Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said at the Goldman conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a very worthy thing to try to figure this out.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Lucas Shaw" datetime="Sep 12, 2014  4:13 PM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-12/disney-to-build-frozen-attraction-at-epcot-park.html"><headline>Disney to Build 'Frozen' Attraction at Epcot Park</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is bringing the hit
movie 'Frozen' to its Epcot theme park in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new attraction, based on the Arendelle kingdom in
'Frozen,' will replace the Maelstrom ride at Epcot's Norway
Pavilion, Disney Parks  Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs said
said today in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney is adding 'Frozen' attractions to a number of its
parks. Starting in November, the company will transform
Cinderella Castle at its Magic Kingdom near Orlando into an ice
palace for the holidays. Several 'Frozen' characters will
appear in a Christmas parade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Frozen,' released in 2013, is the fifth-highest grossing
movie of all time, with $1.27 billion in global receipts,
according to Box Office Mojo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell less than 1
percent to $89.67 at the close in New York. The shares have
advanced 17 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Christopher Palmeri and Anthony Palazzo" datetime="Sep 20, 2013  4:39 PM ET" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-20/disney-to-end-film-deal-with-pirates-producer-bruckheimer.html"><headline>Disney Ends Film Deal With 'Pirates' Producer Bruckheimer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS) will end its
partnership with 'Pirates of the Caribbean' producer Jerry Bruckheimer as the company looks to rein in film costs and focus
on movies from Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-look deal with Bruckheimer, one of the best-known
action producers in Hollywood, won't be renewed when it expires
in 2014, Burbank, California-based Disney said yesterday in a
statement. They will continue to work together on projects
including the fifth 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision underscores the pressure on studio Chairman
Alan Horn to limit risk while placing huge bets on a handful of
big movies with blockbuster potential. While the first four
'Pirates' films generated $3.73 billion at the global box
office, Disney pulled the next one from its release schedule,
and Bruckheimer stumbled in July with 'The Lone Ranger,' which
may lose $190 million for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We have had an incredibly successful collaboration over
the past two decades and he is a friend to many of us here,'
Horn said in the statement. 'We will continue to work together
in the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruckheimer, 67, spent 25 years with Disney, making 27
films ranging from 'Armageddon' to 'Pearl Harbor' to
'National Treasure: Book of Secrets.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'Frozen' is still hot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two toys based off Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s hit animated film made Adventure Publishing Group's Toy Insider Hot 20 list released today, making it the only entertainment property with multiple items on the roster. Disney and its licensees had seven items on the list, a selection of toys Adventure's experts expect to top kids' wish lists during the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disney's movie about a princess with magical powers was released on Thanksgiving last year and racked up more than $1 billion in global ticket sales, making it the fifth-highest grossing film of all time. The success caught toymakers by surprise, resulting in a dearth of related merchandise and creating a secondary market that saw 'Frozen' dresses selling for more than $1,000 online. This holiday season, Disney and its licensees are better prepared, with plenty of inventory and products to satisfy fans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's going to be a frozen Christmas, ice cold,' said Laurie Schacht, president of Adventure Publishing, which produces toy-industry magazines. 'The appeal is so broad, and it's such a wonderful story that parents are happy to put merchandise like this in their kids' hands.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 'Frozen"-themed items on this year's list are a singing, moving doll of the movie's protagonist, Elsa, as well as the Cool Tunes Sing-Along Boombox -- a small karaoke machine for the film's best-selling soundtrack. Both items retail for about $35. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adele and Mark Lee, who live in England with their three children, said they got approved for a U.S. mortgage without setting foot on American soil. The vacation home they're buying near Florida's Disney World would have been out of reach if they had to pay all cash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It would have been a stretch,' said Adele, a 35-year-old nursery school teacher, speaking from the family's home near Birmingham. 'We wanted to keep some money here just to fall back on.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lees are using a foreign-national mortgage, a loan for overseas buyers that required a 40 percent down payment, to purchase the five-bedroom house later this month for $423,000. Adele and her husband, a construction worker, plan to rent the Orlando property when they're not living in it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenders are providing greater access to credit for non-U.S. residents to finance vacation houses and investment properties. Foreign buyers, who are helping to fill a void left by Americans facing high borrowing hurdles, spent about $35 billion on U.S. homes using mortgages in the 12 months through March, a 46 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The American pool of borrowers is drying up,' said Anthony B. Sanders, an economics professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. 'Middle-class borrowers have flatlined due to low income growth, and domestic investors are finding it less appetizing because the foreclosure inventory has dried up. So who do you go to? Foreign investors.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growing Share &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At HSBC Holdings Plc, foreign-national mortgages, available to banking clients who deposit at least $15,000, account for about 30 percent of its U.S. home-lending business, according to Peter Alongi, a mortgage sales manager. That's up from a share in the 'teens' in 2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FBC Mortgage LLC, an Orlando-based lender, has increased mortgages to international buyers by 65 percent this year compared with 2013. Calabasas, California-based Mega Capital Funding Inc. started lending to non-residents in June after seeing rising demand from Chinese buyers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Instead of buying two houses in cash they can buy four houses with loans,' said Brian Na, chief executive officer of Mega Capital, which is now issuing about $10 million of the mortgages a month. 'At the same time, buyers can build a credit history in the U.S.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many Americans struggle to qualify for mortgages, lenders are chasing wealthy buyers, including foreigners, whose loans typically require a 30 percent to 40 percent down payment compared with 20 percent for U.S. residents. Banks and smaller firms are offering more loan products to buyers based overseas, most of whom have paid cash for homes in the last few years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cash sales have been falling and in June made up the lowest share of total home purchases, at 33 percent, since September 2008, according to CoreLogic Inc., an Irvine, California-based property-data firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Florida, the state with the largest share of cash sales, smaller community banks have gotten increasingly comfortable lending to foreign buyers, said Rob Nunziata, CEO of FBC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His firm typically offers nonresident borrowers adjustable-rate loans of as much as $750,000 that are fixed for three to five years. The mortgages require at least a 30 percent down payment and six months of cash reserves. Borrowing costs are generally one or two percentage points higher than conventional loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Credit Profiles &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest challenges for lenders are verifying incomes and building credit profiles for non-U.S. residents. Their home countries have tax systems that differ from America's and lenders have to rely on third parties, along with documentation from employers or accountants, said Nunziata. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of FBC's borrowers, Yoram Yahav, said he purchased a few houses in cash before deciding to get a $100,000 loan for a Florida property. He's seeking to build his U.S. credit profile because he plans to bring more foreign capital to America with other global investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You may have $2 million in your bank account in England, but if you want to borrow $80,000 in the U.S. you can't because of this issue with credit,' said Yahav, whose Tel Aviv, Israel-based firm works with management teams in scenario planning for future events. 'This way I can also increase my cash portion and have more money to put into new businesses.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While home loans were available to foreign nationals during the U.S. housing boom, financing dried up as banks tightened credit after the crash. Applications from international homebuyers are now at about the same level they reached during the peak in about 2006, when foreigners needed just a passport and an application to get a mortgage, according to Andy Scott, president of International Mortgages.Net in Orlando, which caters to mostly British clients, including the Lees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Convoluted' Process &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The process is more convoluted,' Scott said. 'It takes longer to get applications through. And there are a lot more checks and balances.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company, which has worked with international buyers in the U.S. and elsewhere for about 13 years, now uses seven lenders, up from only two after the housing bust. The firm moved from Scotland to Orlando a year ago because so many clients were purchasing there, Scott said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buyers from the U.K., Canada, China, Mexico and India accounted for 54 percent of foreign sales in the year through March, data from NAR show. While Canada was the top source of international buyers, China accounted for the largest sales dollar volume because Chinese purchased more expensive properties on average, the Realtors report said. The top five states for international buying are Florida, California, Arizona, Texas and New York, according to the association. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Disney World &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lees have only seen their vacation house in videos taken by their Realtor. They chose it for its swimming pool and proximity to Disney World, which they usually visit annually. The couple plans to rent it for the next five years and may eventually live there year-round. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's amazing what you can get over there for the money,' Adele said. 'I also like that we could do everything over the Internet. We have noticed that Americans love paperwork. But the process was fairly straight forward.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rising prices and competition from cash-rich investors have kept many American homebuyers on the sidelines. Renters have also been blocked from homeownership by down payment requirements and 'very strict underwriting standards,' said Stuart Miller, CEO of Lennar Corp., the largest U.S. homebuilder by market value. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The process itself has become fairly invasive,' Miller said last week on a call with investors. It's 'almost designed to scare people away.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Loan Dropoff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mortgage applications for house purchases are 10 percent below the level a year earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Banks this year are also struggling to replace a falloff in lending dominated by refinancing, which plunged last year when borrowing costs spiked. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While more financing for foreigners will boost property purchases in the U.S., smaller lenders who can't hold as much debt are constrained by a limited secondary market for selling their loans, said Na of Mega Capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreclosure of delinquent borrowers could also be a complicated process for some foreigners, such as those with diplomatic immunity, according to Joseph Pisa, CEO of Northstar Funding Inc., a Hoboken, New Jersey-based lender which focuses on the New York City area. While the borrowers can still get financing, rates are higher because of the additional risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jerry Barker, a real estate agent in Celebration, Florida, said half of his clients, which are mostly European, now get foreign national loans. That compares with about five percent three years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our business has increased because we are able to sell to people we couldn't sell to before,' said Barker. 'Not everybody has a shoe box under their bedsprings with cash.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Nick Turner" datetime="Sep 24, 2014 11:29 AM ET" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-24/hasbro-teams-up-with-disney-to-develop-frozen-princess-dolls.html"><headline>Hasbro Teams Up With Disney to Develop 'Frozen,' Princess Dolls</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Hasbro Inc. (HAS), seeking to make gains
on Mattel Inc. (MAT) in the market for girls' toys, will develop dolls
based on Walt Disney Co. (DIS) princesses and the characters from last
year's blockbuster 'Frozen.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a new agreement between the two companies, Hasbro
will sell dolls from films such as 'Cinderella,' 'Beauty and
the Beast' and 'The Little Mermaid,' as well as 'Frozen,'
beginning in 2016, according to a statement today. Hasbro will
get global rights to the characters, excluding Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move builds on Hasbro's effort to increase its appeal
among girls, who once flocked to Mattel product lines such as
Barbie. Over the past decade, Hasbro has used My Little Pony and
other brands to expand its girls' business to more than $1
billion in revenue, up from less than $300 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We have a true understanding of girls globally and how
today's girls want to play,' Hasbro Chief Executive Officer
Brian Goldner said in the statement. 'The entire Hasbro team is
looking forward to providing consumers with inventive new play
experiences based on the beloved Disney Princess and Frozen
characters and stories.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, gained
as much as 3.5 percent to $54.78 after the Disney announcement.
That's the biggest intraday gain since April 21. Before today,
the stock was down 3.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattel Inc. (MAT), the world's largest
toymaker, placed the most items on an annual industry list that 
tries to predict the hottest gifts for the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in El Segundo, California, has three 
items on the Toy Insider's Hot 20 list, including 'Sofia the 
First Talking Sofia and Animal Friends' that retails for about 
$40. Sofia is the main character in 'Sofia the First,' the 
animated series on Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s Disney Junior network that 
draws on the entertainment's company's Disney Princess brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two products from Hasbro Inc. (HAS), the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based toymaker, made the cut, according to the trade website's
eighth-annual guide for picking toys and gifts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies could use some hit items for the year-end
holiday-shopping season after toy revenue in the U.S. market has
been sluggish the past three years. Hasbro's sales have declined
2.6 percent to $4.06 billion in the past 12 months through June
while Mattel's have increased 4.2 percent to $6.5 billion in the
same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, several retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) and Toys 'R' Us Inc., released their own top toy lists to
boost interest in the items they are betting on for the
holidays. Wal-Mart's top-20 list, which it said was made based
on feedback from 1,000 kids, has 13 items from either Mattel or
Hasbro, compared with the Toy Insider list which has five
products combined from the two manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasbro's items on the Toy Insider list include 'Big Hugs
Elmo,' from its Playskool brand which costs about $60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets and mobile devices specifically designed for young
children, a growing market for companies including Samsung
Electronics Co., were represented by LeapFrog Enterprises Inc. (LF)'s
LeapPad Ultra for $150 and the Kurio Touch 4S from Techno Source
that sells for about $100. &lt;/p&gt;

resolved their legal disputes, and are looking forward to
advancing their shared goal of honoring Mr. Kirby's significant
role in Marvel's history,' the company and the Kirby family
said in a joint statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family in March petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to
review their case after both a federal judge in New York and a
federal appeals court had agreed with Marvel that their father's
drawings were work-for-hire and the family couldn't terminate
the publisher's copyright to the characters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney acquired Marvel for $4.2 billion in 2009. Since
then, characters such as Iron Man and Thor have proved box
office gold for the Burbank, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Marvel's The Avengers' was the top-grossing film of
2012. This year's 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' based on lesser-known Marvel characters, also led the domestic box office with
$315 million in tickets sold since its August release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spider-Man Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Licensing fees from merchandise tied to Marvel characters
such as Spider-Man have boosted the results of Disney's
consumer-products division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Kirby's adult children sent 45 notices to Marvel
to terminate license renewals for the characters in comics
published from 1958 to 1963. Marvel sued in January 2010,
seeking a judgment that the termination notices were invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirby, who died in 1994, also created or co-created the
Fantastic Four and the Avengers. His heirs said their father was
a freelance artist paid by the page who received no benefits
from Marvel. Stan Lee, who worked for Marvel as an editor, is
credited as co-author of the Hulk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marvel said in court papers that Kirby granted the company
rights to the characters in 1972 and that his children waited
too long to make their copyright claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Marvel Worldwide Inc. v. Kirby, 10-00141, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
