&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select weakened
against domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate after Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) shut a pipeline carrying crude from Illinois to
refineries along the Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shut the 20-inch Pegasus line from Patoka, Illinois,
to Nederland, Texas, on March 29 following a leak of Canadian
heavy crude in central Arkansas. The line can transport 96,000
barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Certainly, the main story is the pipeline spill,' said
Andrew Lebow, a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in
New York. 'I think it's unknown how long it's going to be down
for.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at
a $15 discount to WTI at 1:49 p.m. New York time, according to
data from Calgary energy broker Net Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil produced on the Gulf Coast strengthened as WTI weakened
against Brent by $1.57 a barrel to a discount of $14.36 a barrel
at 2:03 p.m. in New York. When Brent gains versus WTI, it
typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with
foreign oils priced against the European benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The volumes have been pretty light,' Lebow said. 'It's
Easter Monday in Europe, and maybe that's exacerbating some of
this trading we're seeing.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy Louisiana Sweet's premium to WTI widened $1.25 to $18
a barrel at 2:01 p.m. New York time, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1.25 to a premium of
$17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poseidon's premium gained $1.70 to $13.20. Southern Green
Canyon strengthened $1.15 to an $11.15 premium. Mars Blend's
premium to WTI rose by $1.25 to $13 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for Thunder Horse, which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
strengthened by $1.30 to $15.30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate oil fell for
the first time in six days and widened its discount to Brent on
speculation that the closure of an Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) pipeline
will increase U.S. inventories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI slipped from the highest price in six weeks as Exxon
shut the Pegasus pipeline, which moves oil from Illinois to the
U.S. Gulf Coast, on March 29 after heavy Canadian crude leaked
in Arkansas. Exxon hasn't said when it will reopen. Brent gained
as much as 1.2 percent as the euro strengthened against the
dollar for a third day. The European benchmark's premium to WTI
widened the most since early February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Inventories are going to grow because they can't continue
to push oil through to the refineries,' said Gene McGillian, an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
'We have to see how long it will remain offline.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI for May delivery dropped 16 cents to settle at $97.07 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose to
$97.23 on March 28, the highest settlement since Feb. 14. The
volume of all futures traded was 10 percent below the 100-day
average for the time of day at 4:19 p.m. The market was closed
March 29 for Good Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for May settlement advanced $1.06, or 1 percent, to
end the session at $111.08 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Volume was 50 percent below the average
for the time of day. Most European markets and businesses are
closed today for Easter Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pipeline Bottlenecks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent's premium to WTI widened to $14.01 a barrel after
settling at $12.79 on March 28, the narrowest level since June
25. The $1.22 increase is the biggest since Feb. 8, when the gap
grew to this year's high of $23.18 after Enterprise Product
Partners LP said on Jan. 31 that capacity will be limited until
late 2013 on its Seaway pipeline to the Gulf Coast from Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New York contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil inventories in the central U.S. rose 0.5 percent in the
week ended March 22 to 115.4 million barrels, the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistical
arm, reported last week. Regional supplies were at the highest
level for this time of year in EIA data going back to 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We've been making some progress' in moving inland oil to
the Gulf, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. Pegasus 'is a
setback. It will probably heighten environmental scrutiny. It
has greater ramifications.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pegasus Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 96,000 barrel-a-day Pegasus pipeline will need to be
excavated as Exxon determines what caused the breach, and Exxon
is awaiting regulatory approval to begin excavation work and
repairs, Alan Jeffers, a company spokesman in Irving, Texas,
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pegasus, a 20-inch (51-centimeter) line that runs to
Nederland, Texas, from Patoka, Illinois, serves refineries near
the Beaumont, Texas, area close to the Louisiana border, Jeffers
said. There are four plants near Beaumont able to process about
1.4 million barrels a day of crude, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is categorizing
the incident as a 'major spill' as it is larger than 250
barrels. It came as TransCanada Corp. (TRP) is proposing to build the
Keystone XL pipeline to link Alberta's oil sands with refineries
in the Gulf Coast. Enterprise and Enbridge Inc. (ENB) switched the
direction of the Seaway line last year to move oil from the
Midwest and Canada to Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental groups such as the National Wildlife
Federation pointed to the rupture of the pipeline as a reason
why President Barack Obama should reject Keystone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;U.S. Manufacturing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures also dropped as U.S. manufacturing expanded less
than forecast in March. The Institute for Supply Management's
factory index fell to 51.3 last month from 54.2 the prior month,
the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 54. Figures higher than
50 signal expansion. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index decreased
0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Losses deepened somewhat in conjunction with equity
market weakness after the ISM manufacturing index showed an
unexpected drop,' Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI reduced an intraday decline of as much as 1.3 percent
as the euro strengthened against the dollar. The European
currency reached $1.2868, the highest level since March 26. A
stronger euro and weaker dollar increase dollar-denominated
oil's appeal as an investment alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was 17.4 percent, up from 16.6 percent on March
28. The figures have slipped from 24.7 percent on Feb. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 415,639
contracts at 4:19 p.m. local time. It totaled 385,611 contracts
yesterday, 31 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.72 million contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Eliot Caroom and Naureen S. Malik" datetime="Apr 01, 2013  6:29 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-01/exxon-developing-excavation-plan-for-pipeline-spill-in-arkansas.html"><headline>Exxon Developing Excavation Plan for Pipeline Spill in Arkansas</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is developing an
excavation and removal plan for a damaged section of its 96,000-
barrel-a-day Pegasus crude pipeline, which was shut after a leak
was discovered in Arkansas on March 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it collected about 12,000 barrels of oil
and water from the spill, classified as major by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, according to a statement from
the Mayflower Incident Unified Command Joint Information Center.
Local officials recommended 22 homes closest to the leak remain
evacuated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We didn't really update it much beyond yesterday, so
we're using 12,000 (barrels of oil and water mixture), hopefully
we can get a newer number tomorrow,' said Charlie Engelmann, a
spokesman for Exxon, by phone. 'We've been continuing our
cleanup efforts, without a question.' Engelmann said he
couldn't speculate on timing for repairs to the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line shutdown may limit flow of crude from western
Canada and the U.S. Midwest, exacerbating a glut of oil in the
area. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened $1.22
today to $14.01 a barrel against Brent, the international
marker, from $12.79 on March 28, the smallest gap since July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-inch Pegasus line runs 940 miles (1,512 kilometers)
from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland, Texas, and serves
refineries around Port Arthur and Beaumont, close to the
Louisiana line. There are four plants near the city able to
process about 1.4 million barrels a day of crude, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sites are operated by Exxon,
Valero Energy Corp., Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heavy Crude &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line was carrying Wabasca Heavy Crude from western
Canada at the time of the incident, Kimberly Brasington, an
Exxon spokeswoman, said yesterday. Wabasca Heavy is a blend of
heavy oil produced in Alberta by Cenovus Energy, Canadian
Natural Resources and other companies that typically has about
4.15 percent sulfur and a 19-20 API gravity, according to Crude
Quality Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select, a blend of heavy bitumen and diluent
that serves as a benchmark for Alberta tar sands formations,
slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at a $15 discount to WTI at
4:57 p.m. New York time, according to data from Calgary energy
broker Net Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon didn't offer a timeline for repairs to the line. The
rupture has been located and Exxon is awaiting regulatory
approval from the Department of Transportation to begin
excavation work and repairs, Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
company, said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oiled Ducks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 54 claims have been made, according to the joint
statement, and 10 ducks with oil on them have been recovered for
treatment, the statement showed. Two other ducks were found
dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major spill in Michigan in July 2010 shut an Enbridge
Inc. crude pipeline for two months, and the cleanup still isn't
complete. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month
directed Enbridge to perform more dredging in Michigan's
Kalamazoo River as part of a cleanup from a July 2010 rupture of
a 30-inch pipeline that also carried heavy crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon was fined $26,200 in 2010 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration for failing to regularly inspect each point where
the Pegasus line crosses under a navigable waterway. PHMSA
specifically cited the line's crossing under the Mississippi
River between Missouri and Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas spill was estimated at a few thousand barrels,
according to a statement yesterday from the Mayflower Unified
Command Center, which includes Exxon, Faulkner County and the
city of Mayflower, Arkansas, said in a statement yesterday.
Exxon hasn't stated the size of the spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen vacuum trucks and 33 storage tanks had been
deployed to the site of the spill to aid clean up efforts,
according to the Unified Command. Exxon has sent 120 workers in
response, and crews were steam-cleaning oil from property today,
according to the joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No oil had reached nearby Lake Conway, and cleanup crews
have deployed 3,600 feet of boom as a precaution, the command
said. &lt;/p&gt;

In return, the groups agreed to withdraw a shareholder resolution on the topic that would have been voted on at Exxon's annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit www.bloomberg.com/sustainability for the latest from Bloomberg News about energy, natural resources and global business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ed Dahlberg got 40 calls in one day when he put a Gulfstream G650 up for sale in February. That's unusual for a private jet -- especially when the asking price tops the $64.5 million on the sticker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We believe this plane's going to bring north of $75 million,' said Dahlberg, president of Manassas, Virginia-based Emerald Aviation Inc. and part-owner of the G650. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barely 15 months after its debut, the world's biggest and fastest business jet is a corporate status symbol, with owners as high profile as Exxon Mobil Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. The waiting list is almost four years long for a factory-fresh model, whetting appetites among tycoons and chief executive officers when a used G650 hits the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's the must-have airplane if you're in the top end of the spectrum,' said Steve Varsano, founder of London-based Jet Business, who's sold two pre-owned G650s since November for more than $70 million each to buyers he wouldn't identify. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;G650s are also must-have for Gulfstream parent General Dynamics Corp., the tank and submarine maker squeezed by shrinking U.S. defense budgets. The jets helped boost 2013 aerospace revenue 17 percent to $8.12 billion, while combat systems unit revenue fell 23 percent to $6.12 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The G650 is doing exceptionally well,' said Peter Arment, a Sterne, Agee  Leach Inc. analyst who has a buy rating on Falls Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics. 'The demand for this plane is going to remain very strong.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Transoceanic Routes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Large, luxury aircraft are the bright spot in a $21 billion private-jet market recovering unevenly from the 2008-09 financial crisis. While orders remain weak for small, personal models like the Mustang from Textron Inc.'s Cessna, corporate fleet managers and billionaires are shopping again for big planes able to make transoceanic routes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm's G650 flew round trip between California and Barcelona before February's Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, where then-CEO Paul Jacobs collected an industry award. That jaunt, as chronicled by airline-data tracker FlightAware, was well within the jet's advertised range of 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers), enough to reach Beijing from New York without refueling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Propelled by Rolls-Royce engines tucked on either side of the rear of the fuselage, the G650 can reach 627 miles an hour at 30,000 feet (9,100 meters), about 93 percent of the speed of sound. It seats as many as 18 people. To ease jet lag, the cabin air pressure is kept higher than on typical airplanes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Engine Whisper &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a recent flight from Phoenix on a G650 owned by Honeywell International Inc., takeoff thrust pressed passengers into soft leather seats as the engines whispered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wood-veneer tables popped out at the touch of a button. Entertainment options included watching satellite television from a seat-belted sofa or gazing out the windows -- billed as the largest on a business jet and fitted with powered shades -- at the red sandstone cliffs of Sedona, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's just unbelievably capable and unbelievably reliable,' Honeywell pilot Andy Eldringhoff said as he guided the plane above the Arizona desert at 16,500 feet. CEO Dave Cote is among the users of the jet, which has Honeywell avionics in the cockpit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With more than 50 delivered so far, the G650 has reset the market for business aircraft designed for maximum speed, comfort and distance. There won't be a competitor in the G650's class until 2016, when Bombardier Inc.'s Global 7000 is due for its initial handover. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exclusive Aura &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulfstream enhances the aura of exclusivity by refusing to let buyers leapfrog by swapping or buying delivery slots, as occurs with commercial jets. The Savannah, Georgia-based company wrote a clause that strictly prohibits contract holders from selling their spots, said Steve Cass, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There is no cutting in line,' Cass said. 'Everyone that we deal with is pretty important folks. Once you go down that, it's a pretty slippery slope. You just don't want to go there.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulfstream started taking G650 orders in March 2008 -- six months before the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy triggered a global credit freeze -- and customers stampeded to put down about $3 million and sign purchase contracts, said Jet Business's Varsano. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Cass said the G650 order book held up during the economic crisis, flight trials were marred by a 2011 crash in New Mexico that killed four Gulfstream employees. U.S. safety officials concluded in 2012 that company pressure to speed up testing caused the accident. Gulfstream President Larry Flynn responded that any failings by the planemaker were inadvertent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Profitable? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The G650 may become Gulfstream's most profitable aircraft ever, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic told investors on Feb. 20 at a Barclays Plc conference. The jet uses 50 percent fewer parts than the smaller G550 and G450 and is assembled at a plant designed for the G650, according to Gulfstream. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't know internally how good we can get, but we know we can get a whole lot better,' Novakovic said of the plane's profitability. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;General Dynamics soared 54 percent to $108.92 in the 12 months ended yesterday, topping the 19 percent gain for the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. Montreal-based Bombardier rose 2 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buyers' silence about the G650 contrasts with the demand. Corporate touchiness about jet ownership only intensified after U.S. automaker CEOs drew criticism for flying company aircraft to Washington in 2008 to beg Congress for an industry bailout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Owners' Silence &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, confirmed that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has a G650 while declining to discuss details. Emily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman for San Diego-based Qualcomm, and Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, declined to comment when asked about the G650s registered to the companies at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A G650 registered to Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. was sold in February, according to FAA records that didn't list the buyer or the terms. The Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based company didn't respond to messages requesting comment on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulfstream is famous for secrecy about what's on the drawing board, and General Dynamics' Novakovic said the next jets won't be unveiled until they're ready to roll out on the tarmac under their own power. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jefferies LLC analyst Howard Rubel said a redo of the G550, the previous flagship, may be under consideration. Jet Business's Varsano said buyers want other the Gulfstream models to get cabins like the G650's. Dahlberg, the Virginia broker, said the G650 itself could be modified to extend its range. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Gulfstream really hit a home run with the product,' said Josh Mesinger, vice president of Mesinger Jet Sales in Boulder, Colorado. 'There is no other product in the world in service that will fly 7,000 miles.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mesinger was the broker that offered the G650 registered to Dick's, with an asking price of $73.5 million, according to an online posting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sold the day the ad appeared. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By David Marino and Naureen S. Malik" datetime="Apr 02, 2013  1:07 AM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-02/exxon-developing-excavation-plan-for-pegasus-oil-pipeline-spill.html"><headline>Exxon Developing Excavation Plan for Pegasus Oil Pipeline Spill</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is developing an
excavation and removal plan for a damaged section of its 96,000
barrel-a-day Pegasus crude pipeline, which was shut after a leak
was discovered in Arkansas on March 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said yesterday it collected about 12,000
barrels of oil and water from the spill, classified as major by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, according to a
statement from the Mayflower Incident Unified Command Joint
Information Center. Local officials recommended 22 homes closest
to the leak remain evacuated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We didn't really update it much beyond yesterday, so
we're using 12,000 (barrels of oil and water mixture), hopefully
we can get a newer number tomorrow,' Charlie Engelmann, a
spokesman for Exxon, said by phone yesterday. 'We've been
continuing our cleanup efforts, without a question.' Engelmann
said he couldn't speculate on timing for repairs to the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line shutdown may limit flow of crude from western
Canada and the U.S. Midwest, exacerbating a glut of oil in the
area. Domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate weakened $1.22
yesterday to $14.01 a barrel against Brent, the international
marker, from $12.79 on March 28, the smallest gap since July. It
was at $14.07 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-inch Pegasus line runs 940 miles (1,512 kilometers)
from Patoka, Illinois, to Nederland, Texas, and serves
refineries around Port Arthur and Beaumont, close to the
Louisiana line. There are four plants near the city able to
process about 1.4 million barrels a day of crude, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The sites are operated by Exxon,
Valero Energy Corp., Total SA and Motiva Enterprises LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heavy Crude &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line was carrying Wabasca Heavy Crude from western
Canada at the time of the incident, Kimberly Brasington, an
Exxon spokeswoman, said March 31. Wabasca Heavy is a blend of
heavy oil produced in Alberta by Cenovus Energy, Canadian
Natural Resources and other companies that typically has about
4.15 percent sulfur and a 19-20 API gravity, according to Crude
Quality Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select, a blend of heavy bitumen and diluent
that serves as a benchmark for Alberta tar sands formations,
slipped 65 cents a barrel to trade at a $15 discount to WTI at
4:57 p.m. New York time yesterday, according to data from
Calgary energy broker Net Energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon didn't offer a timeline for repairs to the line. The
rupture has been located and Exxon is awaiting regulatory
approval from the Department of Transportation to begin
excavation work and repairs, Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for the
company, said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oiled Ducks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 54 claims have been made, according to the joint
statement, and 10 ducks with oil on them have been recovered for
treatment, the statement showed. Two other ducks were found
dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major spill in Michigan in July 2010 shut an Enbridge
Inc. crude pipeline for two months, and the cleanup still isn't
complete. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last month
directed Enbridge to perform more dredging in Michigan's
Kalamazoo River as part of a cleanup from a July 2010 rupture of
a 30-inch pipeline that also carried heavy crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon was fined $26,200 in 2010 by the U.S. Department of
Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration for failing to regularly inspect each point where
the Pegasus line crosses under a navigable waterway. PHMSA
specifically cited the line's crossing under the Mississippi
River between Missouri and Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean-Up &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arkansas spill was estimated at a few thousand barrels,
according to a statement yesterday from the Mayflower Unified
Command Center, which includes Exxon, Faulkner County and the
city of Mayflower, Arkansas. Exxon hasn't stated the size of the
spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen vacuum trucks and 33 storage tanks were deployed to
the site of the spill to aid clean up efforts, according to the
Unified Command. Exxon sent 120 workers in response, and crews
were steam-cleaning oil from property today, according to the
joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No oil had reached nearby Lake Conway and cleanup crews
have deployed 3,600 feet of boom as a precaution, the command
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) plans to develop
the world's biggest floating liquefied natural gas project off
the coast of Western Australia as costs to build onshore plants
in the country surge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, and partner BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) expect to decide whether to go ahead with the
Scarborough floating LNG venture in 2014 or 2015, with the
project starting production in 2020 or 2021, documents lodged on
the Australian Environment Department's website show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy companies from Royal Dutch Shell Plc to Malaysia's
Petroliam Nasional Bhd. want to turn natural gas into liquid at
sea. In Australia, Shell is developing the Prelude floating LNG
vessel -- expected to be as long as the Empire State Building
and weigh six times as much as the biggest aircraft carrier --
after companies including Chevron Corp. (CVX) experienced budget
overruns at onshore LNG projects in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A floating LNG facility has the potential to lower costs by
eliminating the need for pipelines to the coast and reduce the
venture's 'environmental footprint,' Jessica Warne, a
Melbourne-based spokeswoman for Exxon, said today by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon's Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon project is expected to cost more than Deutsche
Bank AG's $12 billion estimate for Prelude, John Hirjee, a
Melbourne-based analyst at the bank, said today by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's plan, which may change, would be to produce about 6
million metric tons to 7 million metric tons of LNG a year,
Warne said. Prelude is expected to produce at least 3.6 million
tons of LNG annually, according to its website. The development
is due to start in about 2017, Shell said in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's floating plant in the Carnarvon Basin off northwest
Australia is expected to be about 495 meters (1,624 feet) long
and 75 meters wide, according to the filing. Prelude, expected
to be the world's largest vessel, will be 488 meters long and 74
meters wide, Shell's website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 12 production wells will be drilled in two phases,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in the documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hague-based Shell's floating LNG venture will cost
$10.8 billion to $12.6 billion, according to figures the oil
company provided when it approved the project in 2011. Exxon's
Warne declined to provide a cost estimate for Scarborough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil (XOM) Corp., Gazprom OAO (OGZD),
Lukoil OAO (LKOD), Total SA (FP) and Edison SpA were among more than 40
energy companies attending the start of the Croatian
government's tender for Adriatic Sea oil and gas exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enel SpA (ENEL), Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE), Petroceltic International
Plc (PCI), Turkish Petroleum Corp., Hunt Oil Co. and Croatia's INA
Industrija Nafte d.d. were also present in Zagreb as tenders
went out for 29 exploration blocks of Adriatic seabed, according
to Economy Ministry spokesman Tomislav Cerovec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia, which is seeking new revenue to revive its
economy, will close the tenders on Nov. 3. The terms are based
on a production-sharing agreement model with a five-year
exploration phase and a 25-year production phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We have a great interest,' Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak told reporters in Zagreb. 'A successful tender will
make Croatia a key gas and oil provider in this part of Europe,
and our gas will be the cheapest in the region.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia, which joined the European Union in July, needs
investment to revive growth after five years of economic
recession. The country revised laws on hydrocarbon research in
June, easing the process for gaining permits to tap more of its
own resources and reduce dependence on Russian gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EU Financing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia may also seek EU financing for a planned liquefied-natural-gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk, Vrdoljak
told Bloomberg News today. A location permit for the terminal
will probably be issued in June, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INA is 'very interested' in the tender, and may take part
in it alone or with a partner, Zoltan Aldott, head of the
management board at INA, told Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocks were drawn up after Norwegian seismic-data
company Spectrum ASA (SPU) completed the imaging of 35,000 square
kilometers (13,500 square miles) of Croatia's seabed last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Croatia may hold as much oil and gas in the Adriatic Sea as
Italy does in the same branch of the Mediterranean,Vrdoljak
said on Oct. 29, citing initial results of the seismic mapping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INA, Croatia's largest refiner, operates offshore platforms
in the northern Adriatic with Edison SpA and Eni. Zagreb-based
INA, controlled by Hungary's Mol Nyrt., has so far had a
monopoly on exploration in Croatia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is seeking to
acquire oil blocks in Brazil two years after drilling three dry
wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, will join 70 other
companies, including Australia's BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP), the world's
largest mining company, and Japanese commodities trader Mitsui 
Co. Ltd. (8031), to register for an oil block auction scheduled for May
14 and 15, according to a copy of the list seen by Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies that will seek to start producing oil in
Brazil include Cnooc Ltd. (883), Premier Oil Plc (PMO), JX Nippon Oil  Gas
Exploration Corp, Panoro Energy ASA (PEN), Hess Corp. (HES), GDF Suez (GSZ) and
Petroliam Nasional Bhd., according to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil hasn't auctioned oil blocks since 2008. While the
country is home to the world's largest oil discoveries this
century after finding the so-called pre-salt reserves under the
Atlantic ocean in 2006, the blocks being auctioned in May are
not part of the same geological formation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blocks that will be made available for the companies
are located off Brazil's northeastern and northern coasts, while
the pre-salt finds are off the coasts of the southeast states of
Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Espirito Santo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon quit its only Brazilian block last year after
drilling three dry holes in deep waters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), BP Group Plc and Statoil ASA (STL) are
among companies that already have production operations in
Brazil that are also competing, as are Total SA (FP) and Repsol SA,
according to the list. Nineteen Brazilian companies will seek
blocks, including OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA. (OGXP3) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dish Network Corp. (DISH) Chairman Charlie Ergen has accumulated a record $10 billion in cash, leaving
investors to speculate whether he's setting his sights on a
takeover of T-Mobile USA Inc. or a merger with rival DirecTV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satellite-TV service tripled its cash balance during
the past year by selling debt, including a $2.3 billion offering
last week, amid a planned wireless expansion that already
prompted a bid for Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) Ergen's $16.4 billion company
now has the most money among U.S. television and phone
providers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergen's cash stockpile -- about the same as Exxon Mobil
Corp.'s -- puts a deal for Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)'s T-Mobile within
reach, said Guggenheim Partners LLC, which would finally let
Ergen bundle a nationwide wireless-phone network with his pay-TV
system. He may also seek to merge with DirecTV and build a
wireless network using spectrum he already owns, according to
Standard  Poor's. Smaller deals, such as snatching MetroPCS
Communications Inc. away from Deutsche Telekom or buying Leap
Wireless International Inc., are other possibilities, according
to Macquarie Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The question remains: What are they going to do with this
ample liquidity?' Tuna Amobi, a New York-based equity analyst
at SP, said in a telephone interview. 'I wouldn't rule out
anything, really, knowing Charlie.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OAO Rosneft (ROSN), the world's biggest
publicly traded oil producer, is in talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
about building a liquefied natural gas plant to target Asia,
challenging OAO Gazprom (GAZP)'s weakening export monopoly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LNG project, either on Sakhalin Island or in the
Khabarovsk region on the Pacific coast, may cost $15 billion,
Neil Duffin, Exxon's president for development, said today in a
video conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin and
Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin warned Sechin, a former deputy, to coordinate with
other companies planning LNG projects in the region. OAO
Gazprom's monopoly faces a challenge from competitors that want
export rights as they seek to enter the LNG market. Gazprom is
planning a facility in Vladivostok and may expand its own
Sakhalin LNG project, currently Russia's only plant for cooling
gas to a liquid for shipment by tanker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'LNG is a magic wand, it is very important for both
Gazprom and Rosneft,' Valery Nesterov, an oil and gas analyst
at Sberbank Investment Research in Moscow, said by phone.
'Rosneft can't really sit and wait because the window of
opportunity, where there is still uncontracted demand, is
between 2018 and 2022.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin has ordered the government to consider a 'gradual'
end to the monopoly on LNG exports as Rosneft and OAO Novatek (NVTK)
are also seeking the right to ship the fuel to markets beyond
the reach of Gazprom's pipeline network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Risking Loss' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia, the holder of the world's biggest gas reserves,
exports almost all of its gas to Europe through pipelines and
risks losing LNG markets as international competitors increase
capacity, Putin said in February. No final decision has been
made yet on liberalizing Russian LNG exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Gazprom's export monopoly isn't a significant obstacle
for new LNG players,' Alexander Burgansky, an oil and gas
analyst at Otkritie Capital in Moscow, said by e-mail today.
'In all likelihood it will be lifted; in case it doesn't,
Rosneft could use Gazprom as an export agent for a small fee.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft is discussing construction of a fleet for offshore
projects with STX Group (028670), Sechin said today at the video meeting,
which included Kang Duk Soo, chairman of the South Korean
shipbuilding and shipping group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft may use gas from the Sakhalin-1 project, where it
is working with Exxon, Sechin said earlier today in comments
reported by Interfax and confirmed by Rosneft's press service.
Rosneft and Exxon, which are also strategic partners on Russia's
Arctic shelf,  plan to complete the study for the LNG plant in
June, Glenn Waller, president of ExxonMobil Russia, said last
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Model &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Rosneft is copying a business model from international
companies which have gas accounting for 30 percent to 50 percent
of production and reserves,' Nesterov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gazprom's planned Vladivostok LNG plant may start
operations in 2018, while its Sakhalin-2 project is considering
a third production line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novatek, Russia's second-biggest gas producer, is
developing the Yamal LNG project in the Russian Arctic with
Total SA. (FP) The plant is set to start producing LNG at the end of
2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), a lightning rod
for environmental activists since the Valdez oil spill a
quarter-century ago, is appeasing some of its harshest critics
by agreeing to disclose internal risk and cost assessments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of the world's second-largest corporation by
market value will vote on just one environmental resolution on
May 28, according to a proxy filing today. That's after Irving,
Texas-based Exxon convinced activist investors to withdraw two
proposals dealing with greenhouse gas restrictions and hydraulic
fracturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentalists and corporate-governance activists from
groups including the Sisters of St. Dominic and Arjuna Capital
have made Exxon's annual meeting a focal point for objecting to
everything from drilling shale to producing motor fuels linked
to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the company sought to head off criticism by
striking deals with some of its opponents after months-long
negotiations. On March 20, Exxon agreed to provide details on
oilfields and other assets whose value may be threatened by
carbon limits; two weeks later, the producer promised to
disclose risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange, resolutions on both issues were withdrawn by
their proponents. Exxon satisfied the first agreement on March
31 by issuing a report that said its oil and natural gas
reserves won't lose value because demand for energy will trump
efforts to curtail climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Binary Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fracking report will be released later this year, Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, said in an April 3 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disclosure agreements haven't been enough to silence
all of Exxon's critics. Mark Lewis, an analyst at investment
bank Kepler Cheuvreux SA in Paris, said the company still hasn't
faced up to the risk that high-cost, carbon-intensive reserves
such as the tar sands in western Canada could deter some
investors who find it socially unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Exxon's view of climate risk appears naively binary,'
Lewis said in a blog post the day after Exxon issued its
reserves-threat report. 'The reality is much more nuanced.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environmental resolutions brought before investors at
last year's annual meeting failed to garner enough votes to
succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A proposal calling on Exxon to disclose risks associated
with shale drilling was supported by 30 percent of shareholders,
unchanged from 2012. A separate item on greenhouse gases
gathered 27 percent of the vote, also little changed from a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil
into Alaska's Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and
local businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon and won a $5
billion punitive damage award in 1994 that was cut to $507.5
million in 2008 by a divided U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. is the biggest corporation by market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in the Gulf Coast
weakened against futures for the first time in six days after
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said a Beaumont refinery fire was in a unit
that was shut for maintenance and didn't affect production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blaze yesterday injured 12 contract employees, seven of
whom remained in a hospital in Galveston, Texas, today, Rachael
Moore, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokeswoman for the company,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in the Gulf widened 1 cent to 13 cents a gallon versus futures
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:51 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reformulated gasoline shrank 3 cents to a premium of 3.5
cents a gallon, while conventional, 87-octane gasoline weakened
3.25 cents to a discount of 9.75 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel on the Gulf remained unchanged
at 1.5 cents a gallon below Nymex futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, slipped $1.27 to fall to $24.72 a barrel. The same
spread for Light Louisiana Sweet oil fell 77 cents to $12.87 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court rejected
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s appeal of a $105 million jury verdict it was
ordered to pay for contaminating underground water in New York
City with a gasoline additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based oil and gas company argued
unsuccessfully that any award was premature because the city
isn't planning to use the disputed wells in southeastern Queens
for another 15 to 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon used the additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether, to
comply with a 1990 federal law that required an increase in the
oxygen content of gasoline in the smoggiest parts of the
country. New York later banned MTBE, as the additive is known,
because of contamination concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Exxon Mobil and other oil companies in 2003,
alleging that they knew MTBE would pollute groundwater. A New
York-based federal appeals court last year upheld the 2009 jury
verdict against the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Supreme Court, Exxon Mobil argued that the Clean Air
Act shields oil companies from liability for using the safest,
most feasible means of complying with the oxygen requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of scores across the country by
municipalities, states and individuals against oil refiners,
distributors and retailers over MTBE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Exxon Mobil v. City of New York, 13-842. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's
biggest energy company by market value, booked two tankers to
haul oil to the U.S. Gulf Coast via the Suez Canal in May at
what may be this year's lowest rates, a shipbroker said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very large crude carriers, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of oil, will load in the Persian Gulf on May 7, Athens-
based Optima Shipbrokers Ltd. said in an e-mailed report today.
The ships were chartered at rates of 15.75 and 16 industry-
standard Worldscale points, it said. Those would be the lowest
levels so far in 2013 for the route, according to figures
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire costs for tankers hauling Middle East crude to the
Gulf Coast slipped 0.2 percent to 18.3 Worldscale points today,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. That's down 26
percent from the start of the year. Charter costs on the journey
declined in the third quarter of every year starting in 2007,
according to figures compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The market is very weak, and I think this summer will be
just as bad as the previous two,' Dag Kilen, an analyst at
Fearnley Consultants A/S, part of Norway's second-largest
shipbroker, said by e-mail. Rates could get 'potentially even
worse if oil prices remain under downward pressure, as it will
tighten OPEC output.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Return Voyages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipowners will seek to cover fuel costs by securing
charters for return voyages after vessels unload their original
cargoes, Kilen said. Exxon Mobil spokesman Richard Scrase in
Leatherhead, England, declined to comment by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VLCCs built in 2010 and carrying Middle East oil to the
U.S. were losing $2,140 a week on average as of April 19,
according to figures from Clarkson Plc (CKN), the world's biggest
shipbroker. The ships were earning $31,227 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire costs for VLCCs on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-Japan
journey were little changed today at 32.06 Worldscale points,
figures from the Baltic Exchange showed. The ships' daily losses
widened to $714 from $254 on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange's assessments don't account for owners'
efforts to improve returns by securing cargoes for return
voyages or reducing speed to burn less fuel. The price of fuel,
or bunkers, the industry's main expense, fell 1.4 percent to
$599.88 a metric ton today, figures compiled by Bloomberg from
25 ports showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a broader measure of oil-
shipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs, added
0.6 percent to 638, according to the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-quarter dividend is payable on June 10 to

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE),
the oil explorer that doubled in value since going public in
2009, is turning into a takeover target for energy companies
attracted to its oil finds from Africa to the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cobalt has been buoyed by offshore crude discoveries that
Global Hunter Securities LLC says could yield a total drilling
potential of as much as 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
That would be equivalent to almost all of the proved reserves of
OPEC member Ecuador, according to data compiled by BP Plc. (BP/)
Larger energy companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) may be
drawn by the chance to bolster crude resources, said Capital One
Southcoast Inc. Suitors also may include Chevron Corp., Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) or ConocoPhillips (COP), said Guggenheim Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Houston-based Cobalt has handed investors more than
triple the gains of the Russell 1000 Energy Index since its
initial public offering, the $11 billion explorer still trades
at a 33 percent discount to the value of its underlying assets,
according to data and analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
With analysts projecting Cobalt's stock will rise another 43
percent in the next 12 months, Stifel Financial Corp. said now
may be the time for a buyer to make a move on Cobalt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's
largest company by market value, said net income rose as
widening chemical margins made up for lower crude production and
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter profit was $9.5 billion, or $2.12 a share,
compared with $9.45 billion, or $2 a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in statement today. Exxon was expected
to report per-share net income of $2.05, based on the average of
19 analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson has been
acquiring North American gas and oil fields and expanding
exploration in Russia, Africa and the Gulf of Mexico to stem
production declines that the company has said will extend
through the end of this year. Exxon's global output will fall 1
percent this year after dropping by 5.9 percent in 2012, the
company said in a March 6 slide presentation to analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon hasn't turned new discoveries into producing fields
quickly enough to replace shrinking output from assets that have
been pumping oil and gas for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's Kearl oil-sands development in Canada that is
expected to produce 3.2 billion barrels over the next three
decades has been beset by equipment-transport and weather
delays. The project was expected to produce its first batch of
pipeline-ready crude 'within days,' Pius Rolheiser, a
spokesman for Exxon's Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) unit, said on April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Share Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon underperformed its biggest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp. (CVX),
and the broader market during the first quarter, advancing 4.1
percent. During that period, Chevron increased 9.9 percent and
the Standard  Poor's 500 Index rose 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude demand declined or stagnated during the first three
months of the year in Europe's largest economies as well as
Japan and South Korea, the Paris-based International Energy
Agency said in a March 13 report. Brent crude futures, the
benchmark for two-thirds of the world's oil, averaged $112.61 a
barrel during the quarter, down 4.9 percent from $118.45 a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon relies on oil and gas sales outside the U.S. for 71
percent of its operating earnings, more than any major U.S. oil
producer aside from Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), Paul Cheng, an analyst
at Barclays, said in an April 8 note to clients. Houston-based
Marathon counts on foreign oil and gas sales for 77 percent of
its operating earnings, according to Cheng. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Futures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of lower crude prices was partly blunted by
higher gas prices in the U.S., where Exxon is the biggest
producer of the furnace and power-plant fuel. Gas futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange averaged $3.478 per million
British thermal units during the January-to-March period, up 39
percent from the year-earlier period, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Exxon became the pre-eminent U.S. gas supplier in
2010 after its $34.9 billion acquisition of XTO Energy Inc.
vaulted the company past Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's worldwide gas production will decline by 5 percent
this year, the company told analysts last month. Shares rose 0.2
percent to $89.43 yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Croatia, which is set to join the
European Union in July, is in talks with Exxon Mobil Co. (XOM),
ConocoPhillips (COP) and General Electric Co. (GE) on investment in oil and
gas exploration in the Adriatic Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'They are all interested, and they are all waiting for the
government to pass the amended law on gas and oil research,'
Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak said in an interview in Zagreb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas consumption in the former Yugoslav region and Albania
will double by 2020 to 11 billion cubic meters of gas a year,
according to an October 2011 study by state-owned pipeline
operator Plinacro d.o.o. Croatia wants to meet increased demand
across the region and reduce European dependence on Russian gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adriatic nation needs investment to revive growth after
four years of recession or stagnation. The government is
expected to adopt amended laws on hydrocarbon research by June,
Vrdoljak said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INA Industrija Nafte d.d., Croatia's largest refiner
controlled by Hungary's Mol Nyrt., so far has had a monopoly on
gas and oil exploration in Croatia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil (XOM) Corp., Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) have the capacity to bid for BG
Group Plc (BG/) after Chief Executive Officer Chris Finlayson resigned
yesterday, said RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finlayson's sudden departure has started speculation that
the U.K.'s third-largest oil company may become a target as bids
for European companies including drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) and
Alstom SA (ALO) show an increased appetite for deals. BG, which has
oil assets in Brazil, gas discoveries in Tanzania and a gas-export plant in Australia, has a market value of 39.6 billion
pounds ($66.7 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Changing CEO after 15 months and review of operating,
investment and portfolio management plans raises questions on a
possible takeover,' Peter Hutton, a London-based analyst at
RBC, said in a note yesterday. Exxon Mobil, Shell and Chevron
have 'the capacity to pursue a cash acquisition' and may need
to offer a 20 percent premium to the current share price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG, trading 'at a materially greater' discount to its
peer group, may also examine plans to sell some assets in Brazil
or Tanzania, Deutsche Bank AG said in a note e-mailed today. The
company shares dropped 14 percent on Jan. 27, when Finlayson
unveiled project delays, and haven't recovered yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permanent Successor &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Reading, England, yesterday said that
the CEO resigned for personal reasons after a little more than a
year in the job. He has been replaced by Chairman Andrew Gould
until a permanent successor is found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG yesterday also ditched an output forecast for 2015
that's just three months old. At the same time, the directors
reiterated their commitment to the company's strategy presented
by Finlayson in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a 'strange announcement,' Neill Morton, a
London-based analyst at Investec Bank Plc, wrote in an e-mailed
report yesterday.  Directors 'seems happy to usher' the CEO
'through the exit' while staying committed to his strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BG rose as much as 2.4 percent to 1,174 pence in London
trading today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is ending its
top-level sponsorship of the Masters Tournament, while United
Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) joins the partner rolls of golf's first
annual major championship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz (DAI), an international sponsor of the
Masters since 2008, will move up to replace Exxon Mobil as one
of three global sponsors of the tournament, joining
International Business Machines Inc. and ATT Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPS, the world's largest package-delivery company, will
take over Mercedes-Benz's previous role and join Rolex as
international sponsors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokesman Alan T. Jeffers said the company was
leaving 'after nine successful years' as it 'continually
evaluates and modifies our sponsorship and advertising
requirements based on business needs.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Payne, executive director of Augusta National Golf
Club, which stages the tournament each April in Augusta,
Georgia, didn't disclose a reason for Exxon Mobil's departure in
a press release announcing the new sponsorships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil joined the Masters for the 2005 tournament
after the club went without sponsors in 2003 and 2004 to protect
its corporate partners from protests against Augusta National's
then-all-male membership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms of the latest agreements weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Masters sponsorship is among the most exclusive in
sports, as the tournament limits television commercials to four
minutes per hour. As part of the agreements, sponsors are given
access to private hospitality cabins built along the course's
first and 10th holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPS's sponsorship comes four days after the Atlanta-based
company and the Teamsters union agreed on a five-year contract
covering 250,000 employees. A two-week Teamsters strike in 1997
cut UPS's volumes as much as 6 percent and cost about $650
million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s Pegasus pipeline
failed because of original manufacturing defects that may have
worsened, according to a report paid for by Exxon and released
by regulators today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It is highly probable that some micro-cracking within the
upset/heat-affected zones might have occurred immediately
following the pipe manufacturing,' Hurst Metallurgical Research
Laboratory of Euless, Texas, said in the report. 'The micro-cracks then likely would have merged by further cracking through
the adjacent areas' during service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon doesn't have a timetable for restarting the line,
David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said
today on a conference call to discuss second-quarter earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line, which was built in the 1940s and delivers 96,000
barrels a day to Gulf Coast refineries from Patoka, Illinois,
was shut March 29 after spilling 5,000 barrels of oil in
Arkansas. Exxon said on July 11 that the report showed the line
failed because of original manufacturing defects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,
released the Hurst report and has finished an initial review of
it, said Damon Hill, a spokesman based in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The (Hurst) study is one part of our overall ongoing
investigation, as we continue working to identify the underlying
cause of the failure,' Hill said by e-mail today. 'The
pipeline will remain shut down until PHMSA is convinced it can
be restarted safely.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failed seam was electric resistance-welded, Exxon said
in its statement. ERW seams in pipelines built before 1970 are
known to have defects, according to a 1989 federal report, and
the process was changed in the 1960s to use higher-frequency
current. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said second-quarter
profit fell for the first time in four years as crude oil prices
declined along with returns from its gasoline and diesel
manufacturing business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $6.86 billion, or $1.55 a share, compared
with $15.9 billion, or $3.41, a year earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. The year-earlier quarter included a $7.5 billion net gain from tax-related items and divestments including the sale of part of its
stake in a Japanese refining business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, a global benchmark, averaged $103.35 a
barrel during the second quarter, down 5 percent from $108.76 a
year earlier. The average margin from processing crude into
transportation fuels narrowed by 12 percent during the April-to-June period as gasoline demand and prices declined in the U.S.
market that burns one of every five barrels of the world's crude
supply, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
has been steering exploration to Russia, Liberia and the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico to revive crude production after $52 billion in
natural gas investments during the past three years floundered
amid depressed prices for the furnace and power plant fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded energy company,
said in March that its combined oil and gas output will fall for
a second straight year as the company constructs new platforms
and pipelines to bring recent discoveries online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Production vs. Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson reduced the full-year capital projects budget by
4.5 percent this year to $38 billion. The company has
underperformed its biggest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp. (CVX), and the
broader market this year, with shares advancing 8.3 percent.
During that period, Chevron increased 16 percent and the
Standard  Poor's 500 Index rose 18 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global oil prices declined during the second quarter as
crude production growth outpaced the expansion in demand by an
almost 6-to-1 margin, according to data from the International
Energy Agency in Paris. The world's oil supply increased by an
average of 590,000 barrels a day, overshadowing the 100,000-barrel rise in daily demand, the IEA said in a July 11 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising natural gas prices in the U.S. failed to offset all
of the impact on profit from weaker crude and motor fuel prices
for Exxon, the largest U.S. gas producer. Benchmark New York
Mercantile Exchange gas futures jumped 71 percent to an average
of $4.018 per million British thermal units in the quarter, from
$2.354 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas comprised more than 48 percent of Exxon's overall
output in 2012, up from 41 percent before the company acquired
XTO Energy Inc. for $34.9 billion in 2010 to tap into the North
American shale drilling revolution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somalia expects to complete an
assessment of its oil and gas potential this year as security
gains in the battle against al-Qaeda militants enable foreign
investors to return, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seismic studies are being conducted onshore and off the
coast of the Horn of Africa nation. Companies including Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and BP Plc (BP/) are in talks with
the government about returning to the country for the first time
since war erupted in 1991, Sheikh Mohamoud said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We are renegotiating with them' on issues including
royalty payments and production-sharing agreements, he said in
an interview today in Washington at the U.S.-Africa Leaders
Summit. 'We're expecting that soon there will be very good
activities that we'll start.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somalia is trying to attract investors to help rebuild its
economy after African Union-backed government forces gained
control of parts of its southern region that had fallen under
the control of al-Shabaab. The Islamist-militant group has waged
an insurgency against the government for the past seven years as
it seeks to create an Islamic state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somalia has no proven oil reserves, drillers are
betting the country has a geology similar to that of Yemen,
which lies across the Gulf of Aden and has 2.7 billion barrels
of proven oil reserves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swiss National Bank trimmed the
number of shares it held in Apple Inc. (AAPL), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and
Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) in the second quarter, a U.S. regulatory
filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zurich-based central bank held 0.3 percent fewer shares
in the iPhone-maker on June 30 than at the end of March,
according to the filing. It cut its shares in both Exxon and JJ
by 0.2 percent. Even so, those three companies remained its top
three U.S. equity holdings. At the same time, it increased the
number of shares it held in drugmaker Merck  Co. (MRK) by 1.1
percent, the data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SNB stands out among major central banks for its equity
holdings -- the U.S. Federal Reserve isn't allowed to purchase
stocks. The Swiss central bank's holdings stem from its decision
to invest 16 percent of its foreign-exchange reserves in shares,
with the majority held in highly rated government bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SNB's foreign-currency reserves ballooned in the wake
of its setting a minimum exchange rate of 1.20 per euro on the
franc in September 2011. The reserves hit a record 453 billion
francs ($499 billion) last month, the SNB said today. While the
SNB's cap defense caused the reserves to climb almost 70 percent
in the first year after its introduction, policy makers have
said they've not had to intervene since September 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SNB spokesman Walter Meier declined to comment on both the
July foreign-exchange figure and the filing, which the SNB is
required to make to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It
doesn't otherwise disclose the stakes it holds in individual
companies. As of the end of June, it held stakes in some 2,500
U.S.-listed companies, the SEC filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Governing Board member Fritz Zurbruegg, the
SNB's investment strategy is to replicate broad-based indexes.
Some companies are excluded on ethical grounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico's vote on rules for the end of its 76-year state-oil monopoly couldn't come at a better time for global energy companies from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to Royal Dutch Shell Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With reserves holding $1.3 trillion of crude at yesterday's prices, Mexico offers a new opportunity for deep-pocketed producers as well as pipeline and power companies to try and mimic an energy revolution that has spurred U.S. oil output to a 26-year high and pushed Canadian production to records. New access to Mexico comes amid unrest in some African oil nations and sanctions that threaten to strangle Russian output, places where some oil companies have invested heavily in production. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An injection of foreign investment could help double daily output to 5 million barrels a day, a figure that would rank Mexico the world's fourth-largest producer. It would join a North American energy boom that has reignited investment in manufacturing and reduced trade deficits as the U.S. seeks to become free of oil and natural gas imports and even begins to contemplate exports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mexico's Oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'The potential is great,' Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston, said in a telephone interview. 'If they play it right, Mexico could become a major oil producer and Mexico, the U.S. and Canada could come very close to energy independence.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO) agreed to buy ConocoPhillips' Clyden lease for about C$751
million ($723 million), expanding their holdings in the booming
Alberta oil-sands region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale includes 226,000 net acres of undeveloped land
near the southern edge of the Athabasca oil sands, Houston-based
ConocoPhillips said in a statement today. Under the agreement,
Exxon will hold 72.5 percent of the leasehold and Calgary-based
Imperial, which Exxon controls, will have 27.5 percent, the
companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the second Canadian purchase in 10 months for Irving,
Texas-based Exxon, which agreed to pay C$2.86 billion for Celtic
Exploration Ltd. in October, gaining access to shale regions in
Alberta and British Columbia. Canada has the world's third-largest oil reserves, after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, and its
output is expected to more than double by 2030, according to the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil-sands projects offer 'the same predictable
production' for years, as companies like Exxon face declining
output from conventional oil fields, said Fadel Gheit, an
analyst with Oppenheimer  Co. in New York who has the
equivalent of a hold rating on Exxon and a buy on
ConocoPhillips. (COP) Exxon said in March its combined oil and gas
production will fall for a second straight year as it builds
platforms and pipelines to bring recent discoveries online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Partner &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale is expected to close in the third quarter and
requires approval from Canada's Competition Bureau,
ConocoPhillips said. Exxon is the largest shareholder in
Imperial Oil, with a 70 percent stake as of Feb. 13, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips gained 0.9 percent to $67.09 at the close in
New York, while Exxon climbed 0.5 percent to $91.78. Imperial
increased 3 cents to C$42.03 in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to bring in a partner, reducing its stake to
27.5 percent while it keeps majority control of the project with
Imperial, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial has been expanding output from its oil-sands
holding, including the C$12.9 billion Kearl project in Alberta
which began production in April. Kearl is on schedule to produce
110,000 barrels a day by the end of the year, the company said
Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Imperial Oil 'this seems like a logical bolt-on
acquisition that's easy to integrate,' Pavel Molchanov, an
analyst with Raymond James  Associates Inc. in Houston, said in
a phone interview today. He has the equivalent of a buy on Exxon
and a sell on ConocoPhillips and doesn't own either shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips has been selling assets for more than three
years to focus on more profitable areas. Chief Financial Officer
Jeff Sheets said earlier this month ConocoPhillips might reduce
its oil-sands holdings. The company expects about $13.5 billion
from its 2012-2013 asset sales program, including $3.8 billion
received through the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and its Russian
partner OAO Rosneft will start exploration drilling in Russia's
Kara Sea tomorrow, undeterred by souring relations between the
U.S. and Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin will give the command to
begin drilling at the Universitetskaya structure tomorrow, the
Kremlin said in an e-mailed statement today. Irving, Texas-based
Exxon and Rosneft will drill using the West Alpha rig and work
will continue through October, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Russia and the U.S. have reached their
lowest point since the Cold War after Russia annexed the Crimea
and the downing of a passenger plane over war-torn Eastern
Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) is the largest shareholder in Rosneft after the
Russian state with an almost 20 percent stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft (ROSN),
the world's largest publicly traded oil companies by output,
will start drilling a $700 million well in the Arctic Ocean
today, undeterred by the crisis in U.S.-Russian relations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin, Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, who's subject to U.S. sanctions, and Exxon's Russia head
Glenn Waller will bless the start of Russia's northernmost well,
the government said yesterday. It's the first step in a quest
for new oil resources to help maintain oil production near a
post-Soviet high of more than 10 million barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union imposed a third round of sanctions last
week, restricting the export of equipment used for offshore oil
production to Russia after its relations with Europe and the
U.S. deteriorated to the lowest point since the Cold War over
the conflict in Ukraine. That hasn't stopped Exxon because the
contract to hire the rig was signed before the measures were
announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'In the area of oil, the sanctions are more symbolic
perhaps at this stage, but if they remain in place for a long
period then they will have some significant consequences,' said
John Lough, a London-based associate fellow at Chatham House, a
London-based foreign policy research group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partners plan to drill the Universitetskaya prospect
after more than two years of planning. Exxon, where output fell
to a five-year low in the second quarter, isn't the only western
oil company involved. BP Plc, the U.K.'s second-largest oil
company by value, has an interest through its 20 percent stake
in Rosneft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Alpha &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universitetskaya is the first of as many as 40 offshore
wells Rosneft plans by 2018 to test the potential of the
unexplored the Arctic Ocean. The geological structure targeted
by the drilling is roughly the size of the city of Moscow and
may contain as many as 9 billion barrels of oil, according to a
presentation on Rosneft's website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West Alpha rig, leased by Exxon from Bermuda-based
Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL), is currently in the Kara Sea about 72 miles off
the coast of Novaya Zemlya, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling will take about 70 days, a period that should be
sufficient to assess the reserves of any discovery, Rosneft's
head of offshore, Zeljko Runje, said on a call with analysts
last week. The area is relatively free of icebergs, meaning work
is ready to start, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions with Russia will make companies pay more attention
to risk, said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects
Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Ecologically Sensitive' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the political background, drilling in the
Arctic Ocean is controversial because campaigners say it
threatens a unique ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The West Alpha platform is fast becoming the most
controversial oil rig in the world,' Gustavo Ampugnani, an
Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace, said in an e-mailed statement.
The companies' plan 'to drill in the ecologically sensitive
Arctic is nothing less than absurd.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon-Rosneft cooperation also includes a $300 million
investment in Russian shale pilot projects, which now risk being
suspended, Rosneft Chairman Alexander Nekipelov said on July 29.
The partners have also invested in a new platform this year to
expand oil production at the Sakhalin-1 project in Russia's Far
East. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sanctions, what sanctions? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. will start drilling a $700 million well in the Arctic Ocean tomorrow, Russia's government said, showing that for all the talk of action against Vladimir Putin's oil industry, the largest U.S. energy company is undeterred. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Russia's relations with Europe and the U.S. deteriorated to the lowest point since the Cold war over the conflict in Ukraine, the European Union imposed a third round of sanctions last week, restricting the export of equipment used for offshore oil production. That doesn't affect Exxon's plans because the contract to hire the rig was signed before the measures were announced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developing the Arctic is vital for Russia, where energy provides half the state's revenue, to maintain oil production near a post-Soviet high of more than 10 million barrels a day. For Exxon, where output fell to a five-year low in the second quarter, a discovery would offer a vital new source of crude. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The well is very important, it's probably one of the most interesting wells in the global oil industry for many years,' James Henderson, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After more than two years' planning Exxon and its partner OAO Rosneft, Russia's state oil producer, will start drilling the Universitetskaya prospect tomorrow, the Kremlin said in a statement today. Putin will give the signal to start Russia's northernmost well accompanied by Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin, who's subject to U.S. sanctions himself, and Exxon Mobil Russia head Glenn Waller. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin lauded Russia's 'old and reliable partner' Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) as he gave the command for the U.S. energy company and ally OAO Rosneft (ROSN) to begin drilling a $700 million Arctic Ocean oil well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Putin, Rosneft Chief Executive officer Igor Sechin and Exxon's Russia head Glenn Waller, undeterred by the crisis in U.S.-Russian relations, together welcomed the start of the country's northernmost well. It's the first step in a quest for new energy resources to help maintain oil production near a post-Soviet high of more than 10 million barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Despite current political difficulties, pragmatism and common sense prevails,' Putin said at the Black Sea resort of Sochi as he gave the command via video to commence drilling today. 'Nowadays, commercial success is defined by an efficient international cooperation. Businesses, including the largest domestic and foreign companies, understand this perfectly.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The European Union imposed a third round of sanctions last month, restricting the export of equipment used for offshore oil production to Russia after its relations with Europe and the U.S. deteriorated to the lowest point since the Cold War over the conflict in Ukraine.

The U.S. also separately sanctioned Russian energy companies Rosneft and OAO Novatek. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santos Ltd. (STO), Australia's third-largest oil and gas producer, expects output to rise as much as
12 percent next year, driven by the start of a $19 billion
natural gas project in Papua New Guinea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production will be 52 million to 57 million barrels of oil
equivalent in 2014, the Adelaide-based company said today in a
presentation. Santos said it will produce 51 million barrels
this year, down from its October forecast that it would produce
at the low end of a 52 million to 55 million barrel range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos will receive a boost from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s
liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, which is
scheduled to begin next year, and is looking to expand in the
Pacific nation, Chief Executive Officer David Knox said today on
an investor webcast. Santos also is building the $18.5 billion
Gladstone LNG project in Queensland, one of seven under
construction in Australia to meet Asian demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production is projected to climb to 80 million to 90
million barrels by 2020, it said today. Santos's operations
include the Fletcher-Finucane oil project off Western Australia,
the Chim Sao oil field in Vietnam and assets in central
Australia's Cooper Basin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos dropped 1.6 percent to A$14.07 as of 10:22 a.m. in
Sydney, while Australia's benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's cut in the 2013 production forecast was the second
time this year Santos had lowered its outlook. The company had
originally forecast 2013 output of 53 million to 57 million
barrels in November last year before cutting it in July, citing
delays at projects in Asia and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gasoline in Los Angeles strengthened

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
strengthened by 4 cents a gallon to a discount of 1.5 cents less

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's
largest company by market value, expects to begin bitumen
production at its Kearl oil sands project in Alberta before the
end of March after weather delays, a company executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is stockpiling ore and
preparing to introduce solvent to the processing plant, David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said during a
conference call today. Initial production will be about 37,000
barrels a day, increasing to 110,000 by the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The weather situation was a major factor in the startup
moving from what we had originally said by the end of the year
to the first quarter,' he said. 'Weather came earlier than
normal, and then it has just been brutally cold up there. And so
we've had to adjust accordingly.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lagging infrastructure has created a glut of oil in Alberta
that pushed prices to a record discount to U.S. crude in
December. Western Canada Select oil in Alberta was priced at a
$42.50-a-barrel discount to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
Oklahoma, on Dec. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It was at $31.50 below the U.S. benchmark at 12:13 p.m. New York
time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon can run all 110,000 barrels of Kearl production in
its own refineries, Rosenthal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We may elect to put some into third-party refineries, but
we do not have an issue in terms of logistics moving those

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX),
the largest U.S. energy producers, are boosting profits with oil
refineries that some analysts and investors urged them to divest
as recently as last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings from processing crude into fuels such as gasoline
and diesel more than made up for lagging returns from oil and
natural gas exploration during the final three months of 2012,
Exxon and Chevron reported today. Fuel refining helped propel
fourth-quarter net income to a five-year high of almost $9.95
billion for Exxon and a record $7.25 billion for Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's biggest refiner, and Chevron, operator
of fuel plants from South Korea to Mississippi, have resisted
the trend among peers such as Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and
ConocoPhillips of spinning off refineries to focus on oil
drilling. The persistence is paying off: Exxon posted the
second-highest annual profit in U.S. history last year,
surpassed only by its own all-time high from 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Even though refining has long been seen by some as a drag
on earnings, it has now been vindicated,' said Ernie Cecilia,
who helps manage $6.7 billion as chief investment officer at
Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. 'We like
integration.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gasoline additive that contaminated
New Hampshire's drinking water still shows up in wells six years
after it was banned, an expert on fuel spills told a jury
deciding whether ExxonMobil Corp. is liable for the damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Lynn, a manager of the state's petroleum remediation
section, testified for the state in Concord today that the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, has recently been
detected in sites including a daycare center's water supply. He
said the chemical moves through water quickly and unpredictably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's widespread in drinking-water wells and it shows up
frequently in places that we don't expect it,' Lynn said.
'Groundwater levels are very high in New Hampshire, which makes
our state very vulnerable.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
lawsuit filed in 2003. The trial began Jan. 14. The case is one
of scores involving MTBE brought since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued that it
can't be held liable because when it put MTBE into gasoline it
was complying with federal regulations that pre-empt state law.
The company contends MTBE was added to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly and thus reduce air pollution as required under the
1990 Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean-Air Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Colburn, who once worked for New Hampshire's
Department of Environmental Services, testified Jan. 28 that the
state wouldn't have participated in a federal clean-air program
called reformulated gasoline, or RFG, if ExxonMobil had warned
of the the additive's risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil said in court papers the state was aware of
MTBE's risks when it opted into the RFG program in 1991 because
several years of studies on the additive had already been done.
New Hampshire extended its participation in the the clean-air
program in 1997. By 1999, the state was trying to get out of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaked, is a 'toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state's drinking water,'
Jessica Grant, an attorney for New Hampshire, said in opening
remarks to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the
state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said that about 40,000 wells are contaminated
with MTBE and about 5,590 at levels determined to be unfit for
drinking. The additive was banned in New Hampshire as of January
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monetary Damages &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contaminated wells is a factor in determining
monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable. The state is
also seeking damages based on market share of gasoline sales in
New Hampshire during the period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver
agreed to dismiss the other defendant from this trial, Citgo
Petroleum Corp., while the company and the state work to
complete a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based unit of
Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the country's state-owned oil
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citgo Liability &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo's market share ranged from 3.1 percent to 8.7
percent, New Hampshire said. Based on those figures, the state
could be seeking $25 million to $71 million from Citgo. If an
accord's not reached by Feb. 15 and no extension is approved,
Citgo would be reinstated to the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides ExxonMobil and Citgo, New Hampshire also sued Shell
Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA
and Hess Corp. All settled before the trial began except
ExxonMobil and Citgo. Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New
Hampshire $35 million in a settlement announced in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has received more than $100 million in
settlements from defendants so far, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. In
2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York City
$104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells in
the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire's lawyers said last week they hoped to
conclude their case by Feb. 21. ExxonMobil would then begin
presenting its case. Previously, the lawyers had said the trial
could last more than four months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-0550, New
Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Sarah Earle and Don Jeffrey" datetime="Feb 06, 2013  2:04 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-06/exxonmobil-disputes-new-hampshire-well-count-with-mtbe.html"><headline>ExxonMobil Disputes New Hampshire Well Count With MTBE</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. told a jury that the
number of New Hampshire wells contaminated with a gasoline
additive is less than one-fifteenth as many as the state has
contended in its trial seeking damages from the oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, cross-examined a
witness who is a state expert on oil spills today in Concord.
New Hampshire has said that as many as 5,590 wells may have more
than 13 parts of the additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or
MTBE, per billion parts of water, a level the state has
determined makes it unfit for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We know and you know that the state has only found 349
wells with contamination above 13 parts per billion in 30 years,
isn't that right?' Lender said to the state's witness, Gary
Lynn, a manager of its petroleum mediation section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Every fifth or sixth well has detectable levels of MTBE
in it,' Lynn replied. 'How much more widespread can it be?' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire might be seeking more than $200 million from
ExxonMobil, the last defendant on trial in the $816 million
state-court lawsuit filed in 2003. The number of wells found to
be contaminated with MTBE is one factor in determining damages
if ExxonMobil is found liable. The trial began Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil Refiners &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of scores of cases involving MTBE filed since
2000 against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical
makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lynn, questioned yesterday by the state, testified that
MTBE still shows up in wells six years after it was banned. He
said the chemical moves through water quickly and unpredictably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's widespread in drinking water wells, and it shows up
frequently in places that we don't expect it,' Lynn said,
mentioning a daycare center's water supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, based in Irving, Texas, has argued in court
that it isn't liable for damage because it added MTBE to
gasoline to comply with federal regulations that pre-empt state
law. Oil companies added MTBE to make gasoline burn more
thoroughly in order to reduce air pollution, as required under
the 1990 Clean Air Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Colburn, who once worked for New Hampshire's
Department of Environmental Services, testified Jan. 28 that the
state wouldn't have participated in a federal clean-air program
called Reformulated Gasoline, or RFG, if Exxon had warned of the
the additive's risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RFG Program &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil said in court that the state was aware of MTBE's
risks when it opted into the RFG program in 1991 because there
had been studies of the additive for several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additive was banned in New Hampshire as of January
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE, which is highly soluble in water and thus can be
carried great distances from where it leaked, is a 'toxic
chemical that does not belong in the state's drinking water,'
Jessica Grant, an attorney for New Hampshire, said in opening
remarks to the jury. It leaked from gas stations, vehicle
junkyards, underground storage tanks and pipe fittings, the
state said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender raised questions today about who was responsible for
the leaks that put MTBE into the groundwater. He cited a state
DES memo that said serious violations by the owners of a
junkyard in Chester had resulted in contaminating the water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'All the Things' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If the owners had done all the things they were supposed
to do, we wouldn't have had MTBE in the groundwater, right?'
Lender asked Lynn during cross-examination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Even if you do everything you're supposed to do, there's
a potential for MTBE to get into the groundwater,' Lynn
replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contaminated wells is one element in the
determination of monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable.
The state is also seeking damages from the companies based on
their market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the
period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on an estimated cost of $816 million to test for, monitor
and clean up the groundwater, New Hampshire could be seeking
about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citgo Petroleum &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 15, New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver
agreed to dismiss Citgo Petroleum Corp., the other defendant,
from the trial while the company and the state work to complete
a settlement. Citgo is the Houston-based unit of Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, the country's state-owned oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo's market share ranged from 3.1 percent to 8.7

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) briefly surpassed Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) as the second-most valuable company, trailing only
Apple (AAPL) Inc. and underscoring the growing role of technology in
the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which became the world's largest online advertiser
through its dominant search engine, had a higher market
capitalization during intraday trading today before falling back
at the close in New York to a value of $395.4 billion compared
to Exxon's $395.7 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Apple had a market value of $463.5 billion. Software
company Microsoft Corp. is No. 4 with $303.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology companies are establishing themselves as key
players worldwide as they disrupt industries from retail to
finance. Google, which went public in 2004 -- 84 years after
Exxon -- has benefited from consumers moving to online services
and content, a trend that's being accelerated by the growing
popularity of smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's the sign of the times,' said Fadel Gheit, an
analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. 'Out with the old and
in with the new.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Under Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest oil producer by market value,
has been under pressure since it reported fourth-quarter output
declined last month. Net income fell 16 percent to $8.35
billion, or $1.91 a share. Sales dropped 3.3 percent to $110.86
billion. Global output for the Irving, Texas-based company
dropped for the ninth time in 10 quarters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s refinery in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, will shut a hydrocracker next week for
about two weeks of planned work, two people familiar with
operations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery currently has an alkylation unit shut for
repairs, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the information is not public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocrackers convert heavy feedstocks into lighter fuels

with catalytic crackers to make high-octane gasoline blending
components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon in Fairfax, Virginia,

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s New Zealand unit
isn't liable for the cost of cleaning up waterfront land it
leased in Auckland partly because the country has no laws to
deal with the issue, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Auckland Waterfront Development Agency, which is
undertaking New Zealand's biggest urban revitalization project,
sought NZ$10 million ($8.3 million) from Mobil Oil New Zealand
Ltd. to pay for the cost of the clean up in the area known as
Wynyard Quarter, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil Oil operated a bulk fuel storage and distribution
center at the site since the 1950s, leaving the properties
'heavily contaminated' when it ceased operations in 2011, the
judge said. The contamination was caused by Mobil's own
operations as well as what was left by previous oil company
tenants and what had spread from neighbors, such as a 1.8
million liter spill of jet fuel by a Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) unit
in 1986, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Unlike a number of other countries, New Zealand has no
specific legislation dealing with liability for historic
contaminated sites,' High Court Justice Sarah Katz wrote in the
Feb. 7 decision, posted on the court's website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobil acted reasonably, leaving the property in a condition
suitable to be taken over by another industrial tenant, Katz
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it signed the last lease in 1985, 'there was no
realistic possibility of the land being used for commercial or
residential purposes,' the judge wrote. 'It was not until a
further plan change became operative in 2010 that there were
concrete provisions to develop the Wynyard Quarter.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is now being developed to include a mix of
residential, retail and commercial uses, while retaining
existing marine and fishing industry uses, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is between Auckland Waterfront Development Agency
Ltd. and Mobil Oil New Zealand Ltd. 2014-NZHC-84. High Court of
New Zealand (Auckland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq is considering additional
measures against Exxon Mobil Corp. over deals the company signed
with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, Deputy Prime Minister
for Energy Affairs Hussain al-Shahristani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oil Ministry is 'studying other measures' against
Exxon after requiring the company to reduce its involvement in
the West Qurna-1 field last year. Authorities in Baghdad have
received a reply from the Kurdistan Regional Government, or KRG,
on proposals for ending an impasse over oil exports from the
region, al-Shahristani told reporters today in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Exxon violated Iraqi law, they were informed about that,
and Iraq started to take measures regarding it,' Shahristani
said. Now, the 'ministry is studying other measures for
violating Iraqi laws,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq's Kurds have halted crude flows via the national
export pipeline to Turkey amid a dispute with authorities in
Baghdad on the legality of deals the Kurds signed with
international companies, such as Exxon and Total SA. The KRG has
announced plans to sell crude it has pumped through its own new
pipeline to Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shahristani didn't give details of the KRG's response to
the central government's proposals for settling the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National oil production is also being constrained by
insufficient storage space in the south, Shahristani said. Iraq
will be unable to maintain production levels at full capacity of
3.5 million barrels a day unless it increases handling capacity
at the southern port of al-Faw, Shahristani said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq pumped as much as 3.524 million barrels on one day in
January, he said. Monthly production in January was 3.05 million
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
nation said it pumped an average 2.85 million barrels in direct
submissions to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
in a report that was released today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s plans to develop
a $14 billion underwater oil field off Newfoundland's coast
allows the world's biggest energy company to hedge against
discounted crude from Canada's oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The better pricing is definitely an issue,' Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. said by phone from
St. Louis on Jan. 4. 'While things could change in the time it
takes to finish the project, it's a great way for Exxon to hedge
their pricing.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment to capture 700 million barrels of heavy
undersea crude at the field about 350 kilometers (218 miles)
southeast of St. John's rivals spending in Alberta's oil sands,
where the estimated 170 billion barrels of recoverable reserves
attracted C$23 billion ($23.2 billion) in spending last year.
Newfoundland and Labrador oil is priced off the global
benchmark, almost twice as high as western Canada's heavy crude,
and will help Exxon add to profit growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Exxon and global competitors seek to lock up reserves in
increasingly hard-to-reach terrain, offshore Canadian oil in
Newfoundland and the Arctic is becoming more attractive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hebron project puts Canada's offshore assets, not
normally the subject of a lot of development 'chatter,' back
on the map, Jennifer Stevenson, a vice president who helps
manage about C$100 billion at Dynamic Funds in Toronto, said on
Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
$70 million award assessed against an Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) unit for
failing to comply with a Puerto Rico law governing gasoline
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices today turned down an appeal from the oil
company's Puerto Rico gasoline wholesaler, which said the award
in the consumer class-action lawsuit violates the Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1996 law was designed to ensure that wholesalers, in
the prices they charge to gas stations, account for the
expansion of fuel in warmer climates. The law requires
wholesalers to make a 'temperature adjustment,' reducing the
price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its appeal, the Exxon unit said it had no way of
complying with the law until regulations implementing the
measure were adopted in 2005. The company said the
Constitution's due process clause barred liability until those
regulations took effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suing consumers said the regulations concerned prices
at the pump and didn't affect the wholesalers' obligation to
provide the temperature adjustment to retailers. The consumers
said the Exxon unit was receiving a windfall of 1.34 cents per
gallon before the law was enacted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico's Supreme Court let the award stand last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Esso Standard Oil Co. (Puerto Rico) v. Trilla
Pinero, 12-445. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. and European oil
companies will pay more for Abu Dhabi crude when the end of a
75-year partnership reduces their direct stakes in the emirate's
output, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Total
SA (FP) lose their rights as shareholders in the company operating
Abu Dhabi's onshore oil fields after their joint venture expires
this week. The international companies will then start paying a
premium of 11 cents a barrel over Abu Dhabi's official selling
price for Murban grade crude, the two people said, declining to
be identified because the contract terms are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'As long as their crude price is reasonably competitive
and they're feeding their trading arms, it's something they can
deal with,' Robin Mills, head of consulting at Manaar Energy
Consulting and Project Management, said by telephone from Dubai
today. 'The companies will be betting that they can trade the
crude to add more than 11 cents of value.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of an accord accounting for more than half of the
output from OPEC's fourth-largest supplier further weakens, at
least temporarily, the role of international companies in the
group, as member nations seek to retain more oil wealth. Abu
Dhabi holds most of the reserves in the United Arab Emirates,
which pumped 2.76 million barrels a day in December, or 9.2
percent of all oil supplied by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Murban Pricing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expiring partnership between the international
companies and state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc,
accounts for about 1.5 million barrels a day of Murban crude,
the U.A.E.'s main blend. Murban for December costs $113.85 a
barrel under Abu Dhabi's retroactive monthly pricing system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc will take full control of the unit operating the
fields while completing a bidding process to award new
concessions, according to a statement from the producer
yesterday. Until a new concession agreement is reached, Exxon,
Shell, BP and Total will buy Murban crude from Adnoc under six-month contracts that will replace some of the oil they would
have taken as equity partners, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi has pumped oil from its onshore fields under
concession deals with Exxon, Shell, Total, BP and Portugal's
Partex Oil  Gas, or their predecessors, that have been in
effect since January 1939. Adnoc became a partner in the 1970s,
forming Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO, in
which the five foreign partners held a 40 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Production Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'BP, Shell, Total and Exxon, each of whom held a 9.5
percent interest, will see an end to some 150,000 barrels a day
of annual production and the loss of about $50 million of annual
fixed income,' Deutsche Bank AG analyst Lucas Herrmann wrote in
a note today. 'More surprising is that at this stage there has
been no temporary extension and that Adnoc, the state oil
company, has taken full control of the fields.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four companies, which retain some stakes in Abu Dhabi's
offshore production, are among 11 from the U.S., Europe and Asia
that submitted bids in October for new production agreements in
the Persian Gulf emirate. Partex, the smallest partner in ADCO
with a 2 percent stake, wasn't invited to bid. Adnoc may take
until January 2015 to choose new partners, Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi, the company's director general, said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interim Agreements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc at first considered signing yearlong oil supply
contracts with BP, Exxon, Shell and Total, the people with
knowledge of the matter said. By signing six-month agreements
instead, the state producer will have greater flexibility in the
event concession agreements are reached earlier than next
January, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen at BP, Exxon and Shell declined to comment. Total
media representatives didn't immediately comment when contacted
by phone. An Adnoc spokesman declined to provide additional
comment beyond what the company said in the statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea National Oil Corp. and Italy's Eni SpA (ENI) have said
they're bidding for the new concessions. The remaining bidders
are Japan Oil Development Co., China National Petroleum Corp.,
Norway's Statoil ASA, Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the U.S. and
Russia's OAO Rosneft, according to Energy Intelligence Group. &lt;/p&gt;

MTBE Fight</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) and Citgo Petroleum
Corp. are the last holdouts in an $800 million lawsuit by New
Hampshire alleging that oil companies knew a chemical added to
gasoline would contaminate residents' groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening statements are set to begin today in Concord in a
trial that pits the state's environmental claims against the
companies' efforts to comply with federal pollution standards.
It's one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether that have been filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire says ExxonMobil and Citgo knew MTBE would
pollute water supplies. The companies say the federal Clean Air
Act overrides the state's claims and by adding MTBE to gasoline,
they were complying with a U.S. mandate to supply fuel that
would burn more cleanly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The oil companies will say: Federal law made us do that
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit,' Keith Hylton, who
teaches law and economics at Boston University School of Law,
said in an interview before the trial began. 'If the federal
regulatory body looked at all the issues that the state would
examine in a lawsuit, then there is pre-emption.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil refiners have added MTBE to gasoline since the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the oxygen level of the fuel and makes it burn more
efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Foul, Putrid' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to filings in the New Hampshire case, MTBE can
render drinking water 'foul, putrid and unfit for human
consumption.' The state said it petitioned the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency in 2001 to get out of its
reformulated gasoline program because of awareness of MTBE's
harmful effects. The additive has been banned in the state since
January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All have settled except Irving, Texas-
based ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of
Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New Hampshire $35 million in a
settlement announced in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has said it has identified 229 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which, according to
court filings, can cause cancer in animals. It said tests in
2005 and 2006 showed MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells
throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Jessica Grant, a lawyer for the state, said at
a pretrial hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Second-Guessing' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is 'second-guessing decisions made by Congress,
the EPA and by the state's own officials to rely on gasoline
with MTBE as the solution to air pollution,' Claire Hassett, a
spokeswoman for ExxonMobil, said in an e-mail. 'Gasoline with
MTBE was a product that worked as it was intended -- it provided
significant health benefits by helping gasoline burn cleaner,
thereby reducing smog.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo said in an e-mailed statement that although it
doesn't comment on pending litigation, its 'strong safety and
environmental record speaks for itself.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there's a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable,' said Hylton,
the Boston University professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies have said ethanol wasn't in large enough
supply at the time an additive was sought and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This case is not about health risks or personal
injuries,' Hassett said. 'There is not a single recorded case
of anyone getting sick from drinking water with MTBE. The
majority of the state's damage claims are based on computer
models and projections not on actual testing or data.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August
rejected a series of motions by the oil companies seeking
judgment without a trial based on the arguments they raised.
Those issues can be brought up again for the jury's
consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state's highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, as well as public
sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case was moved to federal court in New
York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial
evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin, who presided over the trial of New York City's case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York sent New
Hampshire's case back to the state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren't reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Great Distances &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and automobile junkyards. It dissolves in water and
doesn't biodegrade or stick well to soil particles, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'In the 1980s, the defendants knew that the addition of
MTBE would lead to widespread contamination,' Grant said in an
interview after a pretrial hearing Jan. 9. 'Despite knowing
that MTBE posed a greater threat to drinking water resources,
they never posted a single warning.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spills Fault &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,' she
said. 'The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil rose 0.6 percent to $89.61 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading on Jan. 11. Citgo's shares don't
trade publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-
C-0550, State of New Hampshire Superior Court (Merrimack
County). The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE
Products Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) told a jury that a
gasoline additive to reduce air pollution never caused illness
to any resident of New Hampshire, which sued oil companies
claiming the chemical polluted its groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. made opening
statements today in a jury trial of an $816 million lawsuit in
which the state alleges the oil companies knew the chemical
would contaminate groundwater. The state court trial, which
began yesterday in Concord, pits the environmental claims
against assertions by companies that they were simply complying
with federal pollution standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one of scores of cases involving the additive methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000 against oil
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This is not a personal-injury case,' David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury. 'There's not any evidence
that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from MTBE.' He said
there has been no gasoline sold in the state containing MTBE for
more than six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state claimed that the oil companies knew that if they
added MTBE to gasoline it would increase the risk and costs
associated with contamination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline,' Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors yesterday. 'In 1984, Exxon
anticipated that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much.' Each cleanup
at that time would have cost as much as $7 million, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Federal Law &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said the federal Clean Air Act overrides the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel's oxygen level, making it burn more
cleanly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,'
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said today in his opening
statement. 'Nothing worked better in cleaning the air than
MTBE.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston
University School of Law, said the oil companies are counting on
pre-emption, which turns on whether federal regulators 'looked
at all the issues that the state would examine in a lawsuit.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The oil companies will say, 'Federal law made us do that,
and that pre-empts any state lawsuit,'' Hylton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Lawyer &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Quinn, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, told the jury
yesterday that there were 'great benefits to using MTBE but
there were downsides. All of these downsides were known to all
the folks involved.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dissolves in water and doesn't biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water 'foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.'
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE's harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning,' Grant
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela's
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the time the suit covers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo's market share ranged from 3 percent to
8.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender said today that ExxonMobil's market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The majority of the state's damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data,' Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said by e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there's a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable,' said Hylton,
of Boston University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies said ethanol wasn't in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,' she
said. 'The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August rejected oil
company motions seeking judgment without a trial based on the
arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought up again for
the jury's consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state's highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire's case back to the state
court there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City's case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidated Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren't reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the jury was dismissed yesterday, Citgo's Eimer asked
the judge to declare a mistrial, claiming that the state's
lawyer misrepresented a document as one of Citgo's in her
remarks to the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There's a long road ahead of us,' Fauver told the
lawyers. 'This will all be clarified. I don't think it warrants
a mistrial.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord).
The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE Products
Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court, Southern

&lt;p&gt;Alaska plans to jump-start a $45
billion natural gas export project by pitching in more than 10
percent of the cost and joining Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/),
ConocoPhillips and TransCanada Corp. (TRP) as an equity partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement between the state and the four companies
outlines a framework in which Alaska would take as much as a 25
percent stake in a proposed gas processing plant, an 800-mile
(1,287-kilometer) pipeline from Alaska's North Slope and a
liquefaction facility in the Kenai Peninsula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Sean Parnell has asked the Alaska legislature to
approve the deal and give state agencies the ability to
negotiate shipping and leasing arrangements, according to a
statement released today by the Alaska Department of Natural
Resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This is the first time we've had all of the parties
aligned on a path forward,' Joe Balash, the department's
commissioner, said in a phone interview today before the
announcement. The deal gives the project a 'good shot' at
proceeding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint venture renews a prolonged effort to harvest
Alaska's vast reserves of gas, which have remained largely
untapped since the 1968 discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field.
The North Slope holds more than 35 trillion cubic feet of
discovered gas, almost four times the U.K.'s reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas shipments may begin as early as 2021, giving Alaska a
foothold in an increasingly competitive race to supply Asian
countries with liquefied natural gas, or LNG, from North
America. ConocoPhillips has a small LNG export plant in Nikiski
on the Kenai peninsula, the only such facility in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the project is expected to cost $45 billion, the
final bill could reach as much as $54 billion, according to a
November 2013 Black and Veatch Ltd. study produced for the
state. The producers estimated in a February 2013 letter to
Parnell that the cost could reach $65 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the agreement, Alaska will assume a 20
to 25 percent stake in the entire project. TransCanada has
agreed to pay the state's costs for its share in the $22 billion
gas processing facility and pipeline in exchange for a lower
tariff for shipping the gas. That would represent a $5.5
billion investment, Balash said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state would pay as much as $5.75 billion for its share
of the $23 billion liquefaction facility, which would be capable
of shipping 18 million metric tons of LNG a year. The producers
would pay the remaining portion of the $45 billion total project
cost, Balash said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fund Project &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equity stake will allow Alaska to help fund the project
and control transportation costs, he said. Alaska may sell part
of its stake in the project to a number of LNG buyers, allowing
it to reduce what it owes for the liquefaction facility, Balash
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state's project carries a higher price tag than similar
efforts to export gas from the Canadian coast that could be
finished as soon as 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroliam Nasional Bhd., the Malaysian state energy
company, is proposing to spend as much as $15 billion on a
terminal and pipeline to export gas from a site near Prince
Rupert, British Columbia, along Canada's Pacific Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries including Canada, the U.S. and Mozambique are
competing for a share of global gas demand set to increase
almost 50 percent by 2035, according to the International Energy

&lt;p&gt;A chemical additive to gasoline
meant to make it burn more thoroughly poses a long-term threat
of contamination in New Hampshire, a witness testified at the
trial of ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Graham Fogg, a professor of hydrology at the University
of California, Davis, took the stand yesterday in state court in
Concord as the first witness in the state's $816 million
lawsuit. New Hampshire sued oil companies for allegedly using
the additive, MTBE, while knowing its potential for groundwater
pollution as long as 29 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'A problem like this is not going to disappear in a mere 6
years or 16 years or, I would say, 26 years,' Fogg testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Citgo Petroleum Corp. said the additive,
meant to reduce air pollution, never caused illness to any
resident of New Hampshire. The trial, which began Jan. 14, pits
state environmental claims against assertions by companies that
they were complying with federal pollution rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fogg testified the additive can zigzag through fractured
bedrock in unpredictable patterns and remain in groundwater
longer than other compounds. Fogg said the additive poses unique
risks to drinking water when leaked from underground storage
tanks, based on its chemical properties and the state's geology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The contaminant will tend to move along fractures that
are open and connected,' he told jurors. 'Those fractures can
be quite complex.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creates Hazard &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, MTBE creates a hazard that is difficult to
detect and equally difficult to clean up, Fogg said, showing
jurors slides that demonstrated the way MTBE can bleed into
water supplies. The state sought to counter claims by the oil
companies that MTBE has largely disappeared from the water
supply, as well as claims that the additive is safer than some
of the chemicals it displaces when mixed with gasoline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemicals such as benzene 'don't move very fast or very
far, Fogg said. ''They tend to stabilize because of
biodegradation.'' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state claimed in opening arguments that the oil
companies knew that if they added MTBE to gasoline it would
increase the risk and costs associated with contamination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Exxon decided to disregard the recommendation of its own
employees and put MTBE in gasoline,'' Jessica Grant, a lawyer
for the state, told jurors Jan. 14. ''In 1984, Exxon anticipated
that if it added MTBE to its gasoline, the number of
contamination incidents would triple. These incidents would take
longer to clean up and cost five times as much.'' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cleanup at that time would have cost as much as $7
million, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clean Air &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said the federal Clean Air Act pre-empts the
state claims, and that by adding MTBE to gasoline, they were
complying with a U.S. mandate to supply cleaner-burning fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil refiners began adding MTBE to gasoline in the 1970s to
replace lead. From 1995 to 2006, they increased the use of MTBE,
which boosts the fuel's oxygen level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''We had no choice but to put oxygenates in our gasoline,''
Nate Eimer, a lawyer for Citgo, said yesterday in his opening
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of scores of cases involving the
additive methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, filed since 2000
against oil refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants sought to emphasize to jurors that no one
has been injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''This is not a personal-injury case,'' David Lender, a
lawyer for ExxonMobil, said in his opening statement. ''There's
not any evidence that anyone ever got sick or got cancer from
MTBE.'' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Gasoline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender contended that there has been no gasoline sold in
New Hampshire containing MTBE for more than six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE is produced by combining methanol, which is derived
from natural gas, and isobutylene, a byproduct of gasoline
refining. It can leak into the ground from gas stations, storage
tanks and auto junkyards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It dissolves in water and doesn't biodegrade, so it can be
carried with the water great distances from the site of a leak
or spill, according to court papers. The chemical is difficult
and expensive to find, treat and remove, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to New Hampshire case filings, MTBE can render
drinking water ''foul, putrid and unfit for human consumption.''
The state said it petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency in 2001 to get out of its reformulated-gasoline program
because of awareness of MTBE's harmful effects. The additive has
been banned in the state since January 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Warning &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''Despite knowing that MTBE posed a greater threat to
drinking water, they never posted a single warning,'' Grant
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil and Citgo in 2003 along with
Shell Oil Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd.,
Vitol SA and Hess Corp. All settled but Irving, Texas-based
ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela's
state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Shell and
Sunoco agreed to pay $35 million in an accord announced in
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire said it has identified 228 sites that will
require cleanup from contamination by MTBE, which according to
court filings can cause cancer in animals. Tests in 2005 and
2006 found MTBE in 9.1 percent of private wells throughout the
state, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire is seeking $816 million to cover cleanup and
monitoring costs, Grant said, and it will ask for damages from
ExxonMobil and Citgo based on their market shares of gasoline
sold in the state during the period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's market share was about 30 percent, she said.
That means the state will seek $245 million in damages from the
company. Citgo's market share ranged from 3 percent to 8.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lender said yesterday that ExxonMobil's market share in New
Hampshire was only 6.1 percent during that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;''The majority of the state's damage claims are based on
computer models and projections, not on actual testing or
data,' Claire Hassett, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state said the oil companies could have used safer
additives, such as ethanol, and chose not to because MTBE is
inexpensive to produce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If they had an alternative product to use and the
alternative is just as good and avoids serious risk to
consumers, there's a strong argument the defendants have failed
the risk-utility standard and can be held liable,' said Keith
Hylton, who teaches law and economics at Boston University
School of Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Short Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies said ethanol wasn't in large enough
supply when an additive was being sought, and that it presents
its own environmental hazards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's Hassett said the fault lies with whoever
spilled the chemically treated fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'MTBE contamination has been found in New Hampshire
because someone spilled gasoline in New Hampshire, not because
it was added to gasoline in a refinery in another state,' she
said. 'The state should be suing parties responsible for
spilling gasoline.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil companies also said in court filings that a statute
of limitations should prevent the litigation from proceeding.
The state waited three years from the time it detected MTBE in
sites until it sued, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver in August
rejected oil company motions seeking judgment without a trial
based on the arguments they raised. Those issues can be brought
up again for the jury's consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Sources &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2011, the New Hampshire Supreme Court denied a
motion by the companies to decide the case in their favor and
sent it back to the Superior Court. The state's highest court
said New Hampshire could seek damages for contamination of
nonpublic sources of water, such as wells, and public sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire case had been moved to federal court in
New York, where other lawsuits have been consolidated for
pretrial evidence-gathering and motions before U.S. District
Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan. In 2007, the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York sent New Hampshire's case back to the state
court there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin presided over the trial of New York City's case
against ExxonMobil. In 2009, the jury in that case ordered
ExxonMobil to pay $104.7 million after finding it liable for
polluting wells in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases consolidated in New York may be tried separately
in courts around the U.S. if settlements aren't reached. In the
New York litigation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection filed its fourth amended complaint in June. No date
has been set for a trial, which would probably take place in
federal court in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Hampshire trial may take more than four months,
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-
C-0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County
(Concord). The federal cases are consolidated as In re MTBE
Products Liability Litigation, 00-11898, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi will pay Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and Inpex Corp. more to pump oil at the largest field off the
emirate's coast as it extends a contract with the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Japan's Inpex lengthened their deal for the Upper
Zakum field in the Persian Gulf by 15 years through 2041, the
Asian company said today in a statement, without giving further
terms. The companies may get about $2.85 a barrel, up from $1 a
barrel, International Oil Daily reported, without citing anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sought better terms to help pay for artificial islands
to support drilling equipment as output capacity of Murban-grade
crude rises to 750,000 barrels a day by 2017 from about 600,000
barrels now, Ali Hassan Al-Marzooqi, a senior vice president at
the field's operating unit, said yesterday. Output may expand to
1 million barrels a day by 2024, he said. Inpex said the joint
venture operating at Upper Zakum is considering the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon confirmed that the extension was approved by the
Supreme Petroleum Council, Abu Dhabi's top oil policy body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Inpex are also among 11 U.S., European and Asian
operators bidding at Abu Dhabi's largest onshore concession. Abu
Dhabi National Oil Co. began running the fields producing about
1.5 million barrels a day of Murban-grade crude on its own after
a 75-year concession with its partners ended this month,
Director General Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seeking Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, is seeking
investors to help it boost capacity to 3.5 million barrels of
crude a day by 2017 from about 3 million now. The U.A.E. was the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' fourth-largest
producer in the last month, figures compiled by Bloomberg show.
Partners in Abu Dhabi's oil fields also receive allocations of
crude equal to the proportion of their holding in the deposit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc, as Abu Dhabi National Oil is known, holds 60 percent
of the Upper Zakum venture, Inpex 12 percent and Exxon the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Marine Operating Co., another state-led venture
operating a collection of fields, plans to boost production
capacity to as much as 800,000 barrels a day in 2017 from
620,000 barrels now, before expanding to 1 million barrels in
2020, Chief Executive Officer Ali Al-Jarwan said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM)  said in a trial
over claims it polluted New Hampshire's groundwater with a
gasoline additive that the state's own research indicates the
chemical's level will decrease over time without having to be
cleaned up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company today concluded its cross-examination of
the state's chief witness, Graham Fogg, a professor of
hydrology, in the state court trial in Concord. Fogg responded
by saying ExxonMobil's lawyer was selecting isolated pieces of
information and taking them out of context in his questioning.
The trial began Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil is a defendant in the state's $816 million
lawsuit on claims the oil companies knew that the chemical MTBE,
or methyl tertiary butyl ether, would contaminate groundwater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire's suit is one of scores over MTBE against
refiners, fuel distributors and chemical makers. New Hampshire
Superior Court Judge Peter Fauver agreed last week to excuse
another defendant in this case, Citgo Petroleum Corp., while the
company and the state work to complete a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil company's lawyer was trying to show the jury that
Fogg's own research indicated that the amount of MTBE in the
groundwater would naturally decline to levels that aren't
hazardous. Fogg replied that while that was true of some wells,
others would have a higher concentration of the additive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fogg testified last week that about 2 percent of the
state's private wells are polluted with hazardous levels of
MTBE, determined by the state to be 13 million parts per
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Falling Levels &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'In six years you were projecting that 40 percent of the
private wells that you estimate were above 13 million parts per
billion would already be down to 2 million parts per billion,
correct?,' David Lender, a lawyer for ExxonMobil, said during
cross-examination of Fogg today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fogg said that would be 'true for some wells.' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I made calculations that did not assume that it's going
to keep growing forever and ever,' he said. 'I also projected
there would be other wells that would see an increase in
concentration.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A professor at the University of California, Davis, Fogg
estimated that about 40,000 wells are contaminated with MTBE in
the state, and that about 5,590 are contaminated at levels
determined to be unfit for drinking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of contaminated wells is one element in the
determination of monetary damages if ExxonMobil is found liable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state is also seeking damages based on the companies'
market share of gasoline sales in New Hampshire during the
period covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil's share was about 30 percent, the state said.
Based on the state's estimated cost of $816 million to test for,
monitor and clean up the contamination, New Hampshire could be
seeking about $245 million from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citgo's market share during that time ranged from
3.1 percent to 8.7 percent, the state said. Based on those
figures, New Hampshire could be seeking $25 million to
$71 million from Citgo in a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides have until Feb. 15 to agree. If they don't,
Citgo will be reinstated to the case, barring an extension. The
New Hampshire attorney general's office declined to comment on
terms of any proposed settlement. Fernando Garay, a spokesman
for Citgo, declined to comment on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, New Hampshire sued ExxonMobil, Citgo, Shell Oil
Co., Sunoco Inc., ConocoPhillips (COP), Irving Oil Ltd., Vitol SA and
Hess Corp. All settled before the trial except Irving, Texas-
based ExxonMobil and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Petroleos
de Venezuela SA, the country's state-owned oil company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earlier Accord &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell and Sunoco agreed to pay New Hampshire $35 million in
a settlement announced in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Hampshire has collected more than $100 million so far
from the defendants, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state contends that the oil companies knew MTBE
presented a risk of groundwater contamination when they decided
to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Citgo argued that they were complying with
federal regulations that pre-empt state law. They said MTBE was
added to gasoline to make it burn more thoroughly and thus
comply with a federal mandate to reduce air pollution. They also
said MTBE never caused any New Hampshire resident to become ill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTBE lawsuits have also been consolidated in federal court
in New York for pretrial evidence-gathering and motions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a federal jury ordered ExxonMobil to pay New York
City $104.7 million after finding it liable for polluting wells
in the city. ExxonMobil has appealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today's cross-examination, Lender questioned Fogg about
the money his firm has received for work on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's been a significant amount of money,' Fogg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Could it be more than a million dollars?' Lender asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If you want to suggest I'm getting rich off this, I think
you'd be sadly disappointed,' Fogg replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of New Hampshire v. Hess Corp. (HES), 03-C-
0550, New Hampshire Superior Court, Merrimack County (Concord). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Dow Chemical
Co. (DOW), big-dollar lobbying allies on many issues in Washington,
are on opposite sides of a high-stakes fight over how much of
rising U.S. natural gas supplies should be sold overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the nation's largest producer of natural gas, says
exports will create jobs, encourage more production and lower
the trade deficit. Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker by
revenue, uses gas and its byproducts and leads a coalition that
wants to keep prices low by limiting the amount that leaves the
country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two are among the most active corporations in lobbying
Washington, spending a combined $23 million in 2012, according
to public records. They are more often allies than enemies. Both
supported a bill to improve trade relations with Russia last
year, for example. Now they're sniping at one another through
competing trade organizations and blog postings on the gas
issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It means a lot of wealth for them, so they are going to
spend a lot of money on an issue that's fairly narrow in the
minds of most Americans,' said James Thurber, director of the
Center for Congressional  Presidential Studies at American
University in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The fight shows that while ''big business'' tends to get
lumped as a single entity in the public's mind, in truth
''powerful companies fight each other all the time,'' Thurber
said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) surrendered the title of the world's most valuable company to Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) after concern over slowing growth drove the shares to the biggest loss in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple's 12-month reign as the No. 1 stock ended after the shares slumped 17 percent this year, worse than any other companies in the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities. The decline reduced its market capitalization to $413 billion, below Exxon Mobil's $418 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The switch in rankings reflected fading confidence in Apple, whose 15 years of transformation from a near-bankrupt personal-computer maker to a technology leader dominating the smartphone and tablet market helped it become the most valuable U.S. company ever in 2012. Apple shares have fallen by 37 percent from a record in September amid concern that mounting costs and competition may curtail growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You have one company that had pretty high expectations for it for the future and you have Exxon that continues to chip away slow and steady,' Jason Cooper, who helps oversee $2.5 billion in South Bend, Indiana, at 1st Source Investment Advisors, said in a phone interview. His firm owns both Apple and Exxon shares. 'People are coming to the realization that Apple is losing a little bit of gloss and shine.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;iPads, iPhones &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;About $245 billion has been erased from Apple's value since the Cupertino, California-based company rose to an all-time high in September. Even as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook guided Apple to record iPad and iPhone sales, investors worry about management's ability to keep producing hit products more than a year after the death of co-founder Steve Jobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) and others have followed Apple's lead into the era of mobile touch-screen devices and are grabbing market share by introducing smartphones in various designs and prices. In the tablet market, Apple's dominance is threatened by rivals such as Google Inc. (GOOG), which made its first foray with its Nexus 7 device. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple sank 12 percent yesterday after posting the slowest quarterly profit growth since 2003. Earnings will continue to worsen in the current quarter, with analysts projecting a 14 percent drop, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There was little room for imperfection,' Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in San Francisco, said in a phone interview. 'Investors jumped into the parade alongside growth in tech. They forgot that Apple is taking on a herculean effort.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Rebound &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil regained its No. 1 rank, which the Irving, Texas-based company had kept in four out of the six years through 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The stock is up almost 6 percent this year as profit is forecast to rebound from three quarters of declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The energy producer may say on Feb. 1 that fourth-quarter earnings increased 2 percent, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show, as Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson stepped up acquisitions and capital spending to reverse the longest stretch of quarterly production slides in 13 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're getting closer to maybe an inflection point as we enter 2014, where that growth could improve,' Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis, said in a telephone interview. 'Investors pick up on that ahead of time.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple may reclaim its top spot if analysts' price estimates come true. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Valuation Premium &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple will climb to $627.79 (AAP) over the next 12 months, implying a market value of about $589.5 billion, according to analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, Exxon Mobil's market value will reach $434 billion, based on the average share-price forecast of $95.17. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are now willing to pay more for Exxon Mobil's earnings, driving its valuation premium over Apple's to levels not seen in 12 years. The energy producer is trading at 11.7 times reported income, compared with Apple's multiple of less than 10, data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap was biggest since December 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Apple is cheap, nobody disputes that, but somehow all the good facts are interpreted through a different lens now than they were six months ago,' Daniel Arbess, who runs Perella Weinberg Partners LP's Xerion hedge fund, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on 'Surveillance' with Tom Keene. 'Apple is a perfect allegory for what investment sentiment is all about in this world.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Kadhim Ajrash and Khalid al-Ansary" datetime="Jan 27, 2013 10:18 AM ET" feeling_sentiment="n" progress_sentiment="n" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-27/iraq-warns-exxon-on-kurdish-deals-amid-plans-for-bp-development.html"><headline>Iraq Warns Exxon on Kurdish Deals Amid Plans for BP Development</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Iraq's oil minister asked Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) to stop dealing with Kurds if it wants to work with
the central government even as he proceeded with plans for BP
Plc (BP/) to develop fields in northern areas claimed by the Kurdish
authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), Total SA (FP) and Exxon, which operates the West
Qurna-1 oil field in southern Iraq, are among companies that
have angered the central government with proposals to explore in
the Kurdish area. While the Baghdad authorities don't recognize
contracts signed by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional
Government without their permission, foreign investors say
Kurdish authorities offer them more attractive terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Any company that signs deals without the approval of the
central government, we don't deal with them,' Oil Minister
Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said in Baghdad today. 'We can't allow
Exxon to step over the constitution. It can't continue to work
in both places at the same time, they have to choose to work
either in Iraq or in Kurdistan. We are waiting for a final
answer in the coming few days.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central government and the Kurds are entangled in a
feud over disputed land and the sharing of energy revenue. The
Kurdistan Regional Government halted exports of crude by
pipeline last month, with shipments currently limited to volumes
being trucked to Turkey. Iraq is seeking to boost oil sales to
rebuild the economy after decades of wars and sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Disputed Territory &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, the Kurdish authorities said in a Jan. 17
statement that the central government would be acting illegally
if it proceeds with a plan to allow BP, Europe's second-biggest
energy company, to work on oil fields in disputed territory. BP
made a 'good offer' to develop the Kirkuk fields and the Oil
Ministry in Baghdad has sent the proposal to the government
energy committee for approval, al-Luaibi said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq started to export crude through a second single-point
mooring facility in the south of the country, al-Luaibi told
reporters today. The nation also signed an agreement with Kuwait
Energy Co. and Dubai-based partner Dragon Oil Plc (DGO) to explore and
develop oil in Block 9 along Iraq's border with Iran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuwait Energy plans to invest $125 million in the field as
the company is optimistic about finding commercial quantities of
oil, Chief Executive Officer Sara Akbar said at a ceremony in
Baghdad. Iraq replaced Turkiye Petrolleri AO with Kuwait Energy
for the project to develop the block in November, without giving
any public explanation. The agreement is one of four licenses
awarded since an energy auction last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq holds the world's fifth-largest crude reserves,
according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy. The nation
is the biggest producer, after Saudi Arabia, in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s push to export U.S. oil overseas is facing a new obstacle: falling gasoline prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A flood of new oil from Texas to the Great Plains has swamped refineries, driving down prices at the pump 10 percent since March, while global oil prices have hovered at about $107 a barrel. That suggests the world crude market is having waning influence on U.S. gasoline, which instead is beginning to track lower-priced domestic oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. supplies are having a greater impact because they're making up a bigger part of the gasoline market, supplying about 53 percent today, compared with 34 percent less than three years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As cheaper oil translates to cheaper gasoline, Exxon and ConocoPhillips will have a tougher time convincing legislators that ending export restrictions that date back to 1970s oil shortages would benefit the nation, said Sandy Fielden, director of energy analytics at consultant RBN Energy LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If more exports are allowed, 'The most obvious thing that's going to happen is that crude prices will go up and so will gasoline,' Fielden said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are betting the trend will continue, and that West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for oil, will drop about 17 percent by December 2016. A contract for delivery in that month trades at about $80 a barrel, compared with about $97 today. &lt;/p&gt;

Senator Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has joined Exxon, the American Petroleum Institute and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in calling for an end to crude export restrictions that were put in place after the Arab oil embargo in 1973 triggered gasoline shortages in the U.S. Close

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's
largest oil producer by market value, said fourth-quarter profit
dropped the most in four years as it pumped less natural gas
from wells and energy prices stagnated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell 16 percent to $8.35 billion, or $1.91 a
share, from $9.95 billion, or $2.20, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon was
expected to post per-share profit of $1.91, based on the average
of 18 analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's global output dropped for the ninth time in 10
quarters, disappointing investors who had been encouraged when
the company snapped its losing streak during the July-to-September period, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward
Jones  Co. Exxon hasn't sustained output growth for two
consecutive quarters since the first half of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Production fell again so the question becomes,'Have they
already lost the momentum they gained in the last quarter,''
Youngberg said in a telephone interview from St. Louis today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales declined 3.3 percent to $110.86 billion. Exxon's
shares fell 1.2 percent to $93.99 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon pumped the equivalent of 4.216 million barrels of
crude a day during the final three months of 2013, the lowest
fourth-quarter output since 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gas Declines &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1.5 percent rise in crude production, led by new wells in
the Western Hemisphere, was more than canceled out by a 5.2
percent decline in gas output, the company said. Gas supplies
fell in every region of the world where Exxon does business
except for Canada and South America, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world's
oil, declined 0.7 percent to an average of $109.35 a barrel
during the final three months of last year. U.S. natural gas
rose 8.8 percent to $3.85 per million British thermal units.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the bellwether U.S. oil, climbed
11 percent to $97.61 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining and marketing profit tumbled 48 percent to $916
million. Exxon's chemical earnings dropped 5 percent to $910
million, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon earns about three-quarters of its global net income
outside the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is
seeking to revive production growth and limit costs amid
shrinking access to the world's remaining untapped petroleum
reservoirs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's majority-owned Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO), said profit declined to C$1.056 billion ($946 million), or
C$1.24 a share, from C$1.076 billion, or C$1.26, a year earlier.
Record earnings from processing crude into fuels were more than
offset by slumping prices received for Imperial's western
Canadian crude, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial fell 0.6 percent to C$45.52 in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's
biggest energy company by market value, will invest $1 billion
to increase diesel production at its Antwerp refinery . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will add a delayed coker unit at the 320,000
barrel-a-day refinery in Belgium that will convert high-sulfur
oil to diesel for use in trucks and ships, the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon has spent $2
billion in the past decade on expansions in the refinery
including a 130 megawatt power plant and hydrotreater unit that
reduces sulfur from fuels, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The investment addresses an industry shortfall in
capability to convert fuel oil to products such as diesel,'
Exxon said in the statement. The expansion 'is the first of
several being evaluated to further strengthen strategic
refineries in Europe to more successfully face the challenging
industry environment.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's announcement comes after Total SA (FP), the biggest
refiner in western Europe, reported a 10 percent decline in
profit in the quarter ended March 31 on smaller crude-processing
margins caused by overcapacity. European refinery margins shrank
to $6.60 per metric ton of crude processed in the three months
from $26.90 a year earlier, Total said in April, citing its
European Refining Margin Indicator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's shares have increased 0.2 percent this year,
compared with the 6.8 percent gain in the SP 500 Index (SPX) and a
2.3 percent advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The
stock gained 0.7 percent to $101.36 in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleos Mexicanos is beating global
oil producers from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to Chevron Corp. in the
bond market as lawmakers move closer to approving rules to lower
the company's taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar-denominated debt from Pemex, as the state-owned
company is known, has returned 8.3 percent this year, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 6
percent gain for 372 securities from integrated oil companies
globally, a 1.3 percent return on debt issued by Exxon, the
world's biggest energy company by market value, and a 3.3
percent advance on Chevron notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress is debating rules this week to implement the most
sweeping constitutional changes to the nation's energy policies
in seven decades. The government is seeking to reduce Pemex's
tax burden, the highest among the world's top integrated oil
companies, and open the energy industry to more foreign
investment to reverse nine years of output declines. Pemex,
which last month had its credit rating lifted to the highest
ever by Moody's Investors Service, paid $66 billion in taxes,
equal to 54 percent of its sales, in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's a sign of the trust that the market is putting in
the government's ability to deliver on its promises,' Joe Kogan, an emerging-market strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia who
recommends buying Pemex debt, said in a telephone interview from
New York. 'The positive is reforms that make Pemex more
competitive such as a lower tax burden, ability to work with
foreigners, better corporate governance.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreign Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Enrique Pena Nieto pushed through changes to
Mexico's charter in December that will let foreign companies
drill for oil in the country for the first time since 1938.
Exxon and Chevron, along with Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Repsol
SA, have expressed interest in Mexican oil fields, which contain
about 113 billion barrels of prospective reserves. The reforms
may add $20 billion to foreign-direct investment as soon as
2015, according to Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, declined to comment on
the performance of Pemex's debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isabel Ordonez, a spokeswoman for Chevron, the world's
third-largest energy company by market value, declined to
comment on the state oil company's bond rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemex officials didn't respond to an e-mail and phone call
seeking comment on the performance of the company's bonds and
investor speculation that the legal changes would reduce its tax
burden. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bond Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Pemex's bonds due in 2044 have declined 0.83
percentage point this year to 5.32 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers will vote on the specific regulations for opening
the industry and establishing Pemex's new tax structure within
the next month, Senator Jorge Luis Preciado, head of the
opposition National Action Party in the Senate, said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico City-based Pemex has said the reforms may lower its
taxes by $10 billion annually. Its effective tax rate rose to
124 percent last year, the highest among integrated oil
companies globally that disclosed financial statements, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate reflects the company's
income tax expense divided by pretax income in a 12-month
period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico is seeking to reduce its reliance on crude revenue,
paring the percentage of its federal budget that comes from oil
to 27 percent by 2018, from 34 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pemex Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Pemex has the potential to be a much more efficient and
bigger company,' David Bessey, who helps manage $28 billion in
emerging-market debt including Pemex bonds at Prudential
Financial Inc., said in a telephone interview from Newark, New
Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Roche, a fixed-income strategist at Seaport Global
Holdings LLC, said the benefits from the energy-law overhaul are
already reflected in Pemex's bonds, leaving little room for
further gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rally is nearing 'exhaustion' and additional advances
will be 'small,' Roche said by phone from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Pemex's 2044 bonds
instead of similar-maturity debt from Shell has narrowed 0.47
percentage point this year to 1.02 percentage points, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico's peso dropped 0.1 percent to 12.9989 per U.S.
dollar at 7:31 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody's raised Pemex's rating to A3, the fourth-lowest
investment grade and in line with Mexico, on June 19, saying the
legal changes should help improve the company's corporate
governance and access to exploration and production technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Investors take a look at the Pemex credit and they tie it
very closely to what they think about Mexico,' Prudential's
Bessey said. 'The energy reform is clearly a positive.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InterOil Corp. (IOC), the explorer in
talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) to develop natural gas discoveries
in Papua New Guinea, said negotiations are progressing with the
world's largest energy company by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It's moving along nicely,' said Michael Hession, the
former Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) executive named yesterday as
InterOil's chief executive officer. 'I'm not disturbed in any
way, shape or form. I'd emphasize that Exxon and this
negotiation are going to be my number one priority.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil said in May that it started exclusive discussions
with Exxon to develop the gas fields in Papua New Guinea. Exxon
is interested in the assets because they may help expand the oil
producer's $19 billion liquefied natural gas project in the
country, Mark Nolan, vice president for the Middle East and
Australia, told reporters in Brisbane in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hession, who brought PetroChina Co., Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) and
Mitsui  Co. into Woodside's Browse LNG project in Australia in
agreements reached last year, said he carried out extensive
research into InterOil before joining the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'I've been in discussions with InterOil for some months,
since before I left Woodside,' he said. 'It has been a careful
and measured courtship.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil has been searching for international partners to
help fund a Papua New Guinea natural gas project since 2009,
when Bank of America Corp. (BAC)'s Merrill Lynch sold its 35 percent
stake in the venture. Phil Mulacek, who founded the company,
retired as chief executive officer in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Partnership Proposals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil said in 2011 that it hired Morgan Stanley, UBS AG
and Macquarie Group Ltd. to evaluate partnership proposals.
Mulacek said in an October 2011 interview that he expected to
sign a partner by the end of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the discussions with Exxon is the potential
sale of a stake in a license that comprises the Elk and Antelope
fields, InterOil said. Hession declined to provide more
information about the talks or say when he expected the
negotiations to be completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hession left his position overseeing Woodside's Browse
venture in May after Australia's second-biggest oil and gas
producer scrapped a plan to build the project at an onshore site
in Western Australia because it was too expensive. Woodside now
is considering using floating LNG technology to develop the
Browse project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil is incorporated in Canada's Yukon, has offices in
Cairns, Australia and Singapore, and is traded in New York. Elk
and Antelope hold an estimated 9 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, InterOil said in its 2012 annual report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InsideClimateNews.org -- The 1940s-era construction process that ExxonMobil said caused an oil pipe to rupture in Arkansas earlier this year is a common and well-documented problem the pipeline industry has battled for decades'and one the industry believes can be detected and controlled with appropriate vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With proper inspection and maintenance, these catastrophic events can be prevented," said Mohammad Najafi, a pipeline construction expert and engineering professor at the University of Texas at Arlington. "As pipelines exceed their design lives, they need more maintenance and a proper asset management strategy to prevent or minimize these ruptures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves the public and regulators with two critical questions: Did Exxon manage and test its broken Pegasus pipeline according to established guidelines? And, if it did, is the Arkansas accident a warning that other pipelines might be at risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, the repercussions would be nationwide, since many of the nation's liquid fuel and natural gas pipelines are of similar vintage and were built using the same inferior construction techniques. The gas line that ruptured in San Bruno, Calif. in September 2010, killing eight people and destroying 38 homes, included segments made with the same process as the Pegasus pipe. Investigators foundthat the pipeline's owner, Pacific Gas  Electric, had neglected to properly inspect and repair the line and that regulators issued testing exemptions and placed "blind trust" in the company's assurances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent maintenance and testing records for the Pegasus, as well as the metal analysis report that blamed the accident primarily on a 65-year-old manufacturing defect, would offer important insight into why the pipeline failed. Those documents, however, are being withheld from the public as well as from a Congressional committee, two Arkansas Congressmen and a water utility worried that the pipeline could foul drinking water for nearly half a million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has given pertinent data to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), the federal agency that regulates the nation's pipelines, and to Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel (in response to a subpoena). But Exxon says the two most recent inspections it conducted on the Pegasus are proprietary and confidential, so they shouldn't be shared with the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;InsideClimate News has filed a formal request with PHMSA for the metallurgy report, along with a Federal Freedom of Information Act request for additional documents connected to the spill investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMSA hasn't responded to the Freedom of Information Act request, which was filed in early June, and has refused to release the metallurgy report, citing the agency's ongoing investigation of the accident. Exxon spokesman Aaron Stryk said the company is concerned only about keeping the inspection reports private. As far as the metallurgy report is concerned, "it is up to PHMSA when to make that publicly available," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Phillips, senior policy adviser for the House Natural Resources Committee, rejects the notion that the records should be kept from public view. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is information about the chance of this becoming a pattern, then it is information that should be made known," he said. "Without that information, how do you know?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"You can only play the secrecy card for so long."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon tested the Pegasus just a few weeks before the spill by sending a sophisticated inspection device called a pig through the line to look for flaws from the inside. Pipeline owners and regulators rely on pigs to detect corrosion, and specialized pigs are increasingly used to find potentially dangerous seam weld and other pipeline cracks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pigs used by Exxon in 2010 and 2013 both failed to detect the crack that turned into a 22-foot breach, it will cast doubt on their reliability for seam weld inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Weimer, executive director of the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit watchdog organization based in Bellingham, Wash., said Exxon's February test should have flagged the defect that ripped open the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it wasn't detected, then that says maybe there is no way of finding these flaws," Weimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section that failed was constructed using low frequency electric resistance welded (ERW) pipe to create long seams down the length of the pipe. The technique was discontinued by 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all the pipelines of that vintage and built that way have defects, but they are all suspect and require constant monitoring to avoid disaster, experts say. Several industry reports offer step-by-step guidelines for monitoring and maintaining pipelines with these specific flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Kuprewicz, president of the pipeline consulting firm Accufacts Inc., said the known pipe manufacturing defects is like being predisposed to a grave illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may be a dormant gene or it may be an active gene," Kuprewicz said. Depending on how you treat and test the pipeline, "It may go to cancer, or you could live your entire life and it's not a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worrisome Regulatory Gap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interest in the information being withheld from public view is keenest in Mayflower, Ark., where the Pegasus pipeline split open on March 29, sending an estimated 5,000 barrels'or 210,000 gallons'of sticky oil-like Canadian diluted bitumen, or dilbit, into a nearby lake and neighborhood, sickening residents and forcing 22 families to flee their homes. It's also been a longtime concern for Central Arkansas Water, because more than 13 miles of the Pegasus line cross through a utility watershed that serves 400,000 people in the Little Rock area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to know what factors led to the rupture, and [have] assurances that those factors do not exist in the watershed," said John Tynan, watershed protection manager for Central Arkansas Water. "We want to do this through our own third party evaluation of the information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at Central Arkansas Water asked to review Pegasus inspection records, but the request was rebuffed. The water utility wants the pipeline re-routed around the watershed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pegasus pipeline stretches 850 miles from Illinois to Texas, and carries up to 90,000 barrels per day of dilbit from Alberta's landlocked tar sands. Its unusually long outage'four months so far'is already costly for Exxon, and threatens to become more so as its actions are scrutinized by regulators, the public and theEnvironmental Protection Agency, which has sued Exxon alleging that it violated the Clean Water Act. A second lawsuit, filed by the state of Arkansas, accuses the company of violating state environmental regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Canadian oil producers, the idled pipeline is exacerbating a costly gap between pipeline capacity and booming production. What's more, the Pegasus rupture gives more ammunition to those who oppose construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry dilbit from Canada to Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Exxon said the metallurgy report from an independent laboratoryfound that "original manufacturing defects" caused the Pegasus pipe seam to break apart in Arkansas. The lab also found that the pipeline was especially brittle, which limits the metal's ability to flex with changes in pressure or flow inside the line. Exxon said the report included "no findings that indicate internal or external corrosion contributed to the failure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and PHMSA are conducting further tests to determine what else might have contributed to the pipeline's failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The section of the pipeline that burst was built in the late 1940s and originally ferried crude oil from the Gulf northward. After joining together with segments built in 1954 and 1973, the Pegasus carried oil from Nederland, Texas north to Patoka, Ill. For four years, from 2002 to 2006, the pipeline went unused. Then Exxon reversed the pipeline's flow so it could carry a different product, Canadian dilbit, to Gulf Coast refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, in 2009, Exxon reactivated and upgraded pumping stations and other equipment so it could push 50 percent more dilbit through the 20-inch Pegasus line. The capacity expansion would have included a significant jump in operating pressure and stress on the pipeline, according to Najafi, the engineering professor at University of Texas-Arlington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That series of changes did not trigger any regulatory reviews or special testing. PHMSA merely requires pipeline operators to conduct tests at least every five years. The testing methods are at the discretion of pipeline owners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's sound pipe, and you've got a good handle on the threat, [reversing flows or increasing pressure] won't make a difference," said Kuprewicz. "But if you've lost control of the anomalies, either by assumptions or you just don't get it, you are increasing the risk that the pipeline will fail. Is it illegal? No. It's a judgment call by the pipeline operator."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That regulatory gap might become more of an issue as more pipeline operators repurpose aging pipelines by reversing the flow and converting natural gas pipelines to carry oil and dilbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by the National Petroleum Council for the Department of Energy noted that "integrity issues will become more common dues to a number of age-related issues" such as corrosion and weld seam failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pipelines operating outside of their design parameters such as those carrying commodities for which they were not initially designed, or high flow pipelines, are at the greatest risk of integrity issues in the future due to the nature of their operation," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There may be special risks for pipelines moving dilbit. In a presentation to the petroleum council earlier this year, PHMSA's Jeffrey Wiese said a thorough review is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the slides presented by Wiese, the agency's associate administrator for pipeline safety, said: "We strongly support a rigorous analysis of the unique risks associated with dilbit transportation. Threats posed by this different commodity require thorough understanding. Risk controls for these threats must be robust."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, when Exxon reversed the Pegasus line to carry dilbit, it completed a hydrostatic test of the line that caused 12 pipe failures before it passed. The test is designed to force failures to eliminate vulnerabilities that could cause spills when the pipeline is in use. The company's tests in 2010 and 2013 used the pipeline inspection tools known as pigs, which got their nickname from early models that squealed as they passed through pipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several industry reports have found that seam failures similar to the Pegasus rupture were caused by "pressure cycle-induced fatigue," a condition that develops when there are large and frequent swings in a pipeline's internal pressure and flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pipelines carrying dilbit are prone to more pronounced pressure swings that can activate and accelerate pipeline flaws, according to Kuprewicz. That's because the chemical composition and viscosity of the product varies by the batch, depending on how much and what type of diluent is mixed into the tar sands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Exxon's case, the Pegasus failed while operating below its allowed operating pressures, Kuprewicz said. "Which means this seam anomaly grew to a point where even normal operations put it at risk to rupture."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the pipeline accident, PHMSA issued an order that prohibits Exxon from restarting the pipeline until the cause of the rupture is fully understood and adequate protections are in place. Once shipments resume, the pipeline must operate at a lower pressure, PHMSA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at SMU Cox School of Business in Dallas, said the government and Exxon will need to investigate everything about the pipeline in the coming months, beginning in 1948 when the pipeline was first installed. He likened it to a CSI'crime scene investigation'for pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have to look at every little detail because in those details might be the clues to what happened," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They should be looking at the product that has been put through the line over the years, the operating pressures and checking for any anomalies noted; those kinds of things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuprewicz said that as the investigation proceeds the public and outside experts should have access to the pertinent reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can only play the secrecy card for so long," he said. By denying public access to key information, "all you're doing is adding suspicion to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republished with the permission of InsideClimate News, a Pulitzer Prize-winning non-profit news organization that covers energy and climate change issues.

&lt;p&gt;Activist Bill McKibben, who helped turn an obscure oil pipeline project into a high-profile political fight, has a new target for his effort to curb global warming: energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McKibben's group, 350.org, is asking colleges, cities and churches to divest their financial holdings from a group of 200 companies that produce coal, oil or natural gas. So far six schools, 16 cities and 11 religious institutions have agreed to divest from those companies, according to his group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We know we can't bankrupt Exxon,' McKibben said in a meeting with Bloomberg News in Washington. 'But we think we can politically bankrupt them.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McKibben's group has modeled its campaign after the 1980s divestment effort aimed at companies working with the apartheid regime in South Africa. Unless these companies can be persuaded to leave 80 percent of the available fossil fuels in the ground, climate change will proceed at a pace that would be catastrophic for the planet, they say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Students at more than 300 campuses, including the eight Ivy League schools, have joined the movement, which got a mention from Obama during his climate speech last month. They are demanding that over the next five years schools purge their endowments of investments in 200 publicly traded companies with the largest reserves of oil, gas and coal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exxon Reacts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon says divestment is the wrong approach to deal with greenhouse-gas emissions. 'We take great offense to being compared to an apartheid regime,' Alan Jeffers, a company spokesman, said. 'We don't think it's an effective part of the debate' to focus on divestment, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McKibben should instead be trumpeting the growth of natural gas, which emits half the carbon-dioxide as coal when burned for electricity, he said. 'We are surprised the environmental community doesn't embrace natural gas more,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The effort is a shift in approach for McKibben, who started 350.org in 2008, focusing much of its energy on defeating the TransCanada Corp. (TRP)'s application to build the Keystone XL pipeline. The pipeline would carry the oil produced from the tar sands of Alberta to U.S. refineries along the Gulf of Mexico. That oil is especially carbon-heavy, and locking in production of the tar sands for the next 40 years is especially problematic, McKibben says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If we can bottle up this stuff, then we can buy some time,' McKibben said. 'If we can block Keystone, then the tar sands is basically a dead letter.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What's not clear is if President Barack Obama will agree with McKibben. A State Department analysis found that the tar sands will be developed with or without the pipeline, as producers will use other pipelines or trains to transport the product to refineries. And lawmakers from both political parties are pressing Obama to green-light the application. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a major climate speech, Obama said Keystone would not be in the U.S. national interest if it will, 'significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If that is applied in good faith, there is no way this thing could be approved,' McKibben said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Don Jeffrey" datetime="Jul 26, 2013 12:46 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-26/exxon-mobil-s-105-million-mtbe-defeat-upheld-by-u-s-court-1-.html"><headline>Exxon Mobil's $105 Million MTBE Defeat Upheld on Appeal</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A U.S. jury's $104.7 million damage
award against Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) for contaminating New York City
wells with the gasoline additive MTBE was upheld by a federal
appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award for compensatory damages to clean up contaminated
wells was proper, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan said in
a ruling today, denying Exxon Mobil's challenge to the 2009
verdict. The Irving, Texas-based company said it plans to appeal
the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We reject Exxon's argument that the jury's verdict
conflicts with and is therefore pre-empted by the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990,' the appeals panel said, adding that the
jury properly offset the award by amounts attributed to cleanup
of other contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York sued Exxon Mobil and other oil companies in 2003,
alleging that they knew the gasoline additive methyl tertiary
butyl ether, or MTBE, would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil
argued that state laws are pre-empted by the Clean Air Act,
which required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce
air pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE
to make it burn more thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'MTBE has not been used for seven years, cleanup
successfully continues and the myriad of data shows MTBE
detections decreasing,' Todd Spitler, a spokesman for Exxon
Mobil, said in an e-mail. The company 'will be filing an appeal
to the United States Supreme Court,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consolidated Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case is one of scores around the country by
municipalities, states and individuals against oil refiners,
distributors and retailers over MTBE. Many, including New York
City's, were consolidated in New York federal court for
evidence-gathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state appeals court in Maryland in February reversed two
jury awards totaling $1.65 billion against Exxon Mobil over MTBE
contamination, ruling that the company hadn't made fraudulent
statements and the property owners who sued hadn't demonstrated
physical harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury in New Hampshire state court in April ordered Exxon
Mobil to pay $236 million in damages for contaminating
groundwater with MTBE. The company has appealed that verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York jury determined that it would cost
$250.5 million to treat the water and remove MTBE, which can
give water a bad odor and taste and cause cancer in rodents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Punitives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that Exxon Mobil
shouldn't be liable for the entire cleanup cost because the
wells contained pollutants not from gasoline. She also denied
punitive damages because the company hadn't recklessly
disregarded risks. The wells hadn't been used for drinking
water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court today rejected cross-appeals by the city.
It said the lower court was correct both in ordering that the
damage award take into account pollution from other sources and
in denying punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court rejected Exxon Mobil's request for a
retrial on the ground of juror misconduct. The company argued
Scheindlin should have declared a mistrial after one juror
complained that she was threatened by another. The threatened
juror was released while the one who allegedly made the threat
was not. Exxon Mobil claimed the dismissed juror was harassed
because her opinion differed from fellow jurors'. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial lasted 11 weeks and the jury deliberated for 11
days. It focused on a representative sample of five wells in the
New York City neighborhood of Jamaica, Queens. All other
defendants had settled with the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Products
Liability Litigation, 10-4329, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago fuels strengthened relative
to New York futures after Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reduced rates at the
238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet, Illinois, refinery, the fifth-largest plant in the U.S. Midwest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel in Chicago
narrowed 0.5 cent to 4.5 cents a gallon versus New York
Mercantile Exchange futures at 12:43 p.m. The spread trimmed for
a fifth day, the longest such streak since Nov. 16, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or
CBOB, narrowed by 4.75 cents to 6 cents a gallon below futures,
the strongest position since July 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fuels rallied after regulatory filings showed that
Exxon's Joliet refinery shut an 'east co' boiler and cut rates
on July 26. The plant produces about 9 million gallons of
gasoline and diesel a day, according to the company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricia Simpson, a spokeswoman for Exxon, said the
information in the filings with the U.S. National Response
Center and Illinois Emergency Management Agency was accurate.
She declined to comment on day-to-day operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cut in production at the plant may contribute to lower
supply of refined products in the area, where the Energy
Information Administration reported distillate stockpiles fell
to 28.8 million barrels on July 19. Gasoline inventories were
49.1 million barrels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel fuel based on West
Texas Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, widened $1.33 to
$19.20 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) and
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will borrow $1.2 billion from banks for
expansion of their joint venture petrochemicals project in the
kingdom, two people familiar with the deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al-Jubail Petrochemcial Co., known as Kemya, will raise a
total of $2.2 billion through a mix of shareholder loans and
bank debt, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. The funding will have a
tenor of 10 years, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kemya is building a specialty-elastomer plant on the
kingdom's Persian Gulf coast that will produce 400,000 tons of
rubber products a year, which will be sold in Saudi Arabia and
exported to the Middle East and Asia. Construction contracts
were awarded in June 2012 with production expected to begin in
the second half of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A $900 million loan from 10 local and international banks
will be backed by Sabic, while Exxon Mobil will guarantee a $100
million facility from non-Saudi banks. Kemya will also borrow
about $200 million in Saudi riyals in a non-guaranteed loan, the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the financing, Exxon Mobil will also provide a
shareholder loan of $900 million, while Sabic will contribute
$100 million, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Sabic wasn't immediately available for
comment, while a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Qatar didn't
immediately respond to a phone message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) fell after
reporting oil and natural gas production declined to the lowest
level in almost five years, raising the stakes as it seeks to
pursue crude deposits in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy company dropped 4.2 percent to
$98.94 at the close in New York, the biggest slide in almost
three years, after reporting second-quarter earnings that beat
analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's oil and gas output decreased 5.7 percent to
the equivalent of 3.84 million barrels a day, the lowest since
the third quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Exxon had been expected to post quarterly output
equivalent to 3.96 million barrels, based on six analysts'
estimates. Crude from Exxon wells in Europe and Asia dropped,
while gas production faltered in every region in which the
company does business except Africa and the South Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is going after crude in Russia's Arctic regions in an
effort to extract some of the largest oil reserves and reverse a
trend of declining production for the company. Its allocating
$39.8 billion to capital projects this year, including hundreds
of millions for an exploratory well in Russia's Kara Sea, as
part of a 29-year agreement signed with Moscow-based OAO Rosneft (ROSN)
in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanctions threaten to halt that progress after the U.S. and
European Union said July 29 they would restrict the export of
technologies for energy production to Russia. The oil-producing
nation holds an estimated $8 trillion worth of crude
underground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profit Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is awaiting further details on U.S. and EU sanctions
to determine any effects, Vice President David Rosenthal said on
a conference call today. He declined to comment on how the
recently completed Berkut platform, a joint venture with Rosneft
of Russia's Far East coast, was financed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Because these new oil technology sanctions imposed by
Europe and the U.S. governments do impose some restrictions on
Arctic drilling technology, it may have an effect on these
Arctic drilling plans,' Pavel Molchanov, a Houston-based
analyst for Raymond James  Associates Inc., said in a phone
interview before the results were released. Molchanov rates
Exxon the equivalent of a buy and doesn't own the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower production figures came as the company reported
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Excluding one-time
items, per-share profit was 19 cents more than the $1.86 average
of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income climbed 28
percent to $8.78 billion, or $2.05 a share, from $6.86 billion,
or $1.55, a year earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company said
in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Higher Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings were driven by higher fuel prices. Brent crude
futures, a global benchmark, rose 6 percent from a year earlier
to average $109.76 a barrel in the second quarter. Natural gas
futures prices in New York rose 14 percent to average $4.579 per
million British thermal units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's performance has trailed competitors and the
Standard  Poor's 500 Index for the past year, gaining 7.3
percent, less than half of the SP's move. The company, which
has a market value of $432 billion, has 14 buy ratings from
analysts, 13 holds and five sells. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in Los Angeles weakened
for a second straight day as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) restored
operations at the Torrance refinery following a power failure
last week and a maintenance turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant near Los
Angeles was scheduled to flare gases through June 5 as it
restarted units, Gesuina Paras, a spokeswoman at the refinery,
said by e-mail. The refinery is 'working to normalize'
operations after a power failure May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torrance complex also began a turnaround on equipment,
including crude, alkylation and coker units, around May 3 that
was expected to last several weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
dropped 3.25 cents to a premium of 4.25 cents a gallon against
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:23 p.m.
New York time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt delivery
there slipped 0.23 cent to $2.8276 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco declined 3.25 cents to a premium of
6.25 cents a gallon. Prompt-delivery dropped 0.23 cent to
$2.8476 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for San Francisco Carbob versus the same fuel
in Los Angeles was unchanged at 2 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail gasoline in the state, which typically trails the
spot market, fell 0.5 cent to $3.987 a gallon, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA, the nation's largest motoring organization,
said today on its website. Prices at the pump are down 5.8
percent from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CARB Diesel &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco was
unchanged versus ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex at
a discount of 1.5 cents a gallon. The same fuel in Los Angeles
gained 2 cents to a premium of 3 cents a gallon, the largest
since April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/)'s 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in Southern
California was scheduled to shut a coker this week for planned
repairs, according to two people familiar with the schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil-products tanker Nave Bellatrix, anchored off the
coast of Panama, was scheduled to load clean products June 9 on
the U.S. West Coast for delivery to Chile, ship-fixture data
compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. West exported 73,000 barrels of distillate fuel
oil a day in March, up 22 percent from a year earlier, according
to data from the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department's statistical arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Portland Gasoline &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Portland, Oregon, conventional, 84-octane gasoline
climbed 0.5 cent to a discount of 0.5 cent a gallon. Low-sulfur
diesel there dropped 3 cents to 8 cents a gallon under ULSD
futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland gasoline's discount to Los Angeles Carbob narrowed
3.75 cents to 4.75 cents a gallon versus Los Angeles Carbob,
after the gap stretched to the widest in a month last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened a third
day, gaining 1.4 cents to $18.76 a barrel at 4:24 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough measure of refining margins, is at the
highest level in more than two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline weakened to the
lowest level in a week versus New York futures as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) completed maintenance at a Joliet, Illinois, refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago fell
10 cents to a premium of 50 cents a gallon above futures traded
the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 4:15 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the smallest differential
since May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread narrowed for a fifth consecutive day after Exxon
said it completed a refinery-wide turnaround at the 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet plant, the fifth-largest in the U.S.
Midwest. The work, which began April 14, shut all operating
units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'That's what has us coming off today,' Steve Mosby, vice
president of supply consultant ADMO Energy LLC in Kansas City,
Missouri, said in a phone interview. 'Exxon isn't out there
buying, so we seem to be cooling off. Joliet is also a large
plant and it's going to put a lot of material out there.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline inventories in the U.S. Midwest, or PADD 2, were
48.4 million barrels in the week ended May 31, after falling to
4.76, the the lowest level since Nov. 30, earlier in the month,
according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may take awhile for Joliet's output to reach the market,
Mosby said. BP Plc (BP/) said on June 6 that it plans to restart this
month its Whiting, Indiana, refinery's largest crude unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chicago-Gulf &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return of oil refineries in the Midwest may also spur
exports of gasoline and diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast,
according to Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based analyst at
Morgan Stanley. Plant restarts will boost Midwest capacity by
more than 300,000 barrels a day, he said in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped $3.05 to $40.87 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast strengthened 3.5 cents to a discount of 11.75 cents a
gallon versus Nymex futures at 3:59 p.m., the strongest level
since Feb. 27. Reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, advanced 1.5
cents to 1.5 cents a gallon above futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differentials widened after Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)
said a fluid catalytic cracker remained shut at its 81,500-barrel-a-day Texas City, Texas, refinery following a leak on
June 7. Crude units were brought back online at the plant over
the weekend, said Jamal Kheiry, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrocracker work at Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)'s Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery also continued today, said Bill Day, a company
spokesman based in San Antonio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf, based on WTI, gained 39
cents to $21.24 a barrel, while the same spread for Light
Louisiana Sweet oil increased 69 cents to $12.04 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline weakened for a
sixth day, the longest streak of declines since December, on
speculation inventories of the motor fuel will get a boost from
the restart of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s Joliet, Illinois, refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for conventional, 85-octane gasoline slid 22
cents to 28 cents a gallon versus futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 2:39 p.m., the smallest premium since May
29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential tightened 57 cents in the past six days of
trading after Exxon completed maintenance at the 238,000 barrel-a-day Joliet refinery, the fifth-largest in the U.S. Midwest.
The plant-wide turnaround, which began April 14, shut major
operating units for the duration of the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return of Joliet may boost stockpiles in the region, which
Energy Information Administration data show were 152,000 barrels
below the five-year average for the time of year as of May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Exxon got caught in a position where maintenance may have
taken longer than expected,' Patrick DeHaan, a Chicago-based
gas analyst at GasBuddy.com, said by phone. 'They were caught
buying between when they originally thought they'd be done and
what the reality was and the market may have overreacted.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago gasoline peaked at a premium of 85 cents a gallon
versus Nymex futures on June 3, the highest level in data going
back to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles of motor fuel in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
were 48.4 million barrels in the week ended May 31, after
dropping to a five-month low in early May, EIA data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped $6.71 to $34.16 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO), the U.S. oil
producer that has been expanding exploration from Ethiopia to
Texas, picked as its next chief executive officer the Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) engineer who helped oversee the global portfolio of
the world's largest energy company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee M. Tillman, 51, formerly Exxon's vice president of
engineering, will succeed Clarence Cazalot as Marathon's CEO and
president on Aug. 1, the Houston-based company said in a
statement today. Cazalot, who has been CEO of the company since
it was formed in 2002, is ending a 41-year career in the energy
industry with his Dec. 31 retirement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillman will need to adjust to operating at a smaller
company with fewer resources than Exxon, Fadel Gheit, a New
York-based analyst at Oppenheimer  Co., said in a telephone
interview today. His appointment was a surprise because Tillman
doesn't come from a company with Marathon's narrow focus on
exploration and production, Gheit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'If he can adapt very quickly, I'm sure he will be a
tremendous success,' Gheit said. 'Let's not forget that this
guy has an incredible background and is obviously very
qualified.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillman joined Exxon in 1989 after studying chemical
engineering at Texas AM University and Auburn University. His
international assignments included postings in Scotland,
Indonesia and Equatorial Guinea. The Texas native said in a 2012
interview with Dice Holdings Inc.'s Rigzone website that he had
a 'passion for cars' and that if he hadn't become an engineer
he would have been a Formula 1 race car driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cazalot's Legacy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Warren, a Marathon spokeswoman, said neither Cazalot
nor Tillman were available for interviews today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon rose 2.9 percent to $34.37 at the close in New
York and was the best-performing oil producer in the Standard 
Poor's 500 Energy Index. The stock has increased 12 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cazalot, 62, led Marathon through its split from what
became U.S. Steel Corp. (X) in 2002 and the consolidation of the
company's fuel-making business through the acquisition of
Ashland Inc. (ASH)'s stake in a joint venture three years later. In
2011, Cazalot reversed course and shed the refining unit after
saying the effort to mimic the so-called integrated model of
larger oil producers such as Exxon had failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Cazalot's tenure, Marathon achieved average annual
gains of 29 percent, outperforming Exxon's 17 percent increases
and Chevron Corp.'s 16 percent advances, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marathon's lead director, Dennis H. Reilley, will become
chairman of the board upon Cazalot's departure, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson talked up his company's prospects in
Russia, appearing in Moscow alongside OAO Rosneft (ROSN) CEO Igor Sechin, who's been sanctioned by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work between Texas-based Exxon, the world's largest oil
company by market value, and state-run Rosneft on Sakhalin
Island in Russia's Far East provides a template for further
exploration, especially in the Arctic's Kara Sea, Tillerson said
at the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We look forward to taking advances achieved in the
cutting-edge success in the Far East of Russia and building on
them to unlock new supplies of oil and gas,' Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is pursuing a global alliance with Rosneft even
after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Sechin, a close ally of
President Vladimir Putin, as part of a package to punish Russia
for annexing Crimea from Ukraine. The two companies plan to
drill a well in the Kara Sea later this year, targeting a
formation that could hold more than 8 billion barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'All major projects this year are related to our joint
work with Exxon,' Sechin, who's banned from traveling to the
U.S., said at the same event. It's 'business as usual.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson declined to comment on U.S. sanctions on Sechin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as the Sakhalin project and Kara Sea exploration,
Exxon's alliance with Rosneft includes shale exploration in
Siberia and joint venture fields in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remoteness of the Arctic well -- four days voyage from
the nearest port in iceberg-prone seas -- means it will be among
the most expensive Exxon has ever drilled, costing at least $600
million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is shutting the
crude distillation unit at the Torrance, California, refinery
for a week or two of repairs related to a metallurgical issue, a
person familiar with the operations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the units at the 150,000-barrel-a-day plant
near Los Angeles will operate at about half of normal rates
while the crude unit is out of commission, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman at the refinery, didn't
immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crude unit returned to full rates earlier this month
after parts were shut for a planned turnaround that also
included work on a coker and alkylation unit, two people
familiar with the schedule said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torrance refinery, which processes mostly heavy crude
from California's San Joaquin Valley, makes almost 10 percent of
the state's gasoline and provides jet fuel to Los Angeles
International Airport by pipeline, Exxon's website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mikael Holter" datetime="Jun 23, 2014  6:34 AM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-23/exxon-s-norway-output-threatened-as-union-readies-pension-strike.html"><headline>Exxon's Norway Output Threatened as Union Readies Pension Strike</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A Norwegian oil-workers union said
it's ready to go on strike over pensions in a move that
threatens to cut oil production from Exxon Mobil Corp.'s
platforms in the North Sea by more than 60,000 barrels a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A court in Oslo today ruled that a strike notice by the
Safe union that would affect three Exxon platforms is legal,
clearing the way for a walkout, according to the group's leader,
Hilde-Marit Rysst. While the union is yet to decide on a public
mediator's proposal that seeks to bridge differences with
employers, it will do so by the June 27 midday deadline, she
said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Everything is set' for a strike, Rysst said. The
mediator's proposal, endorsed by the Norwegian Oil and Gas
Association, which represents employers in wage negotiations,
'is not good enough,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strike would set Safe apart from two other unions that
reached wage agreements in talks that covered 7,615 offshore
oil-platform workers. In 2012, workers from all three unions
walked out in their longest action, disrupting oil and gas
production until the government intervened to stop companies
imposing a full lockout that would have halted output from
western Europe's largest producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflict centers on pension terms for 31 Safe-affiliated workers at Exxon, the world's largest oil company by
market value. While the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association argued
that the issue isn't relevant for industry-wide wage talks, the
Oslo court ruled Safe's strike notice is legal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Union Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association could meet with Safe
again this week after last week's state-backed mediation, though
there are no talks planned yet, the oil-industry lobby group's
spokeswoman Eli Ane Nedreskaar said by phone. Exxon declined to
comment on talks with the union as it's represented by the
Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, spokesman Knut Riple said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe has threatened to take out 154 of its members from
Exxon's Balder, Ringhorne and Jotun platforms, shutting down
production that reached 61,000 barrels of oil in April,
according to figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. A
strike would also halt production at Det Norske Oljeselskap
ASA's Jette field, which goes through Jotun and amounted to
2,000 barrels of crude a day in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Lynn Doan" datetime="Jun 25, 2013  6:16 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="n" progress_sentiment="n" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-25/los-angeles-gasoline-gains-as-exxon-said-at-lower-rates.html"><headline>Los Angeles Gasoline Gains as Exxon Said at Lower Rates</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in Los Angeles
strengthened for the first time in four days as Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)'s Torrance refinery was said to be running at about 66
percent capacity as the crude unit prepares to restart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant in Southern
California is waiting to return parts of the crude unit, shut
since June 19, to service and will run at reduced rates until
the equipment is restarted, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn't public. The unit, shut
last week to repair a metallurgical issue, is expected to take
about two days to return, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles, rose
0.5 cent to a premium of 20 cents a gallon over futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg at 4:11 p.m. New York time. Prompt-delivery of the
fuel climbed 0.27 cent to $2.9248 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gesuina Paras, an Exxon spokeswoman at the Torrance
refinery, declined by e-mail today to comment on the status of
the crude unit work. She said June 20 that other equipment at
the refinery would run at reduced rates during the repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp. (TSO)'s 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in
Southern California was running normally yesterday after planned
maintenance, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at the company's
headquarters, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco tumbled 7 cents to a premium of 8.5
cents a gallon, the lowest level in almost three weeks. The
discount for Carbob in San Francisco versus the fuel in Los
Angeles widened 7.5 cents to 11.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chevron Richmond &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) started a co-generation plant at the 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery in Northern California yesterday,
a notice to Contra Costa County regulators shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro's 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery near
San Francisco also reported a unit startup June 23, a separate
notice to the county shows. The plant was operating normally
today, Barbee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail gasoline in California slipped 0.4 cent to $4.063 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nation's largest
motoring organization, said today on its website. Prices are up
from $3.845 a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of Californians traveling at least 50 miles for
the July 4 holiday is expected to decline to about 4.7 million
this year, a 0.7 percent drop from a year earlier, according to
AAA Northern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for spot, conventional gasoline in Portland,
Oregon, was unchanged at a premium of 15 cents a gallon.
Portland gasoline's discount to Los Angeles Carbob widened 0.5
cent to 5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed a fourth
day, losing 17 cents to $17.43 a barrel at 4:13 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough indicator of short-term refining
margins, is down 47 percent from this year's high of $32.74 a
gallon reached on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said thunderstorms

Producing Nigeria Qua Iboe Terminal it operates in Akwa Ibom
state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore production and loading of oil continue, the
Irving, Texas-based company said today in a e-mailed statement.
No fatalities or injuries were reported. The amount of oil lost
to the fire and spill hasn't been calculated, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightning ignited the tank and the fire was extinguished by
noon local time June 27, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightning knocked out power to the terminal again today,
resulting in a spill. Emergency response systems were activated
to contain it, shoreline restoration has begun and relevant
authorities and community leaders notified, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp.'s (XOM) biggest
international exploration opportunity may be imperiled by
Russian President Vladimir Putin's Ukrainian foray. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S.-based companies could face restrictions on doing
business in Russia if Putin's regime is slapped with sanctions
by western governments or the United Nations for its
intervention in Ukraine's Crimea region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, under the terms of a 2011 contract with state-controlled OAO Rosneft, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million
acres of Russian land, its biggest exploration holding outside
the U.S. Sanctions could stall Exxon's plans to begin drilling
in the Russian Arctic later this year in partnership with
Rosneft, and threaten the lucrative Sakhalin-1 oil license off
Russia's Pacific Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
agreed to invest billions of dollars and allow Rosneft to buy
stakes in premier North American projects in exchange for access
to Russia's vast Arctic, deep-water and shale resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 61-year-old University of Texas-trained engineer is
seeking to reverse sliding oil and natural gas output at the
world's biggest energy producer by market value. Since assuming
the leadership post of Exxon in January 2006, the company's
stock has increased 65 percent, lagging the 77 percent advance
in the price of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Drilling Rights &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's 11.4 million acres of Russian drilling rights are
eclipsed in size only by the company's 15.1 million acres in its
home country, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Feb. 26. The next largest Exxon holdings
are in Canada, Germany and Indonesia, where the company owns
rights to 6.3 million acres, 5 million acres and 2.3 million
acres, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has repeatedly declined to comment on the impact the
Russian imbroglio in Ukraine may have on its operations or
investment decisions. Tillerson is scheduled to take questions
from analysts and the media later today at the company's annual
strategy presentation at the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's interests in the region aren't confined to Russian
oil fields. The company dispatched high-level executives to the
Ukraine's capital of Kiev six weeks ago to discuss exploring the
country's vast shale deposits, Interfax reported on Jan. 23,
citing the website of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yanukovych was ousted amid violent streets protests in late
February and has since fled to Russia. The January meetings
included Exxon executives Stephen Greenlee and Kevin Biddle,
according to the Interfax report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rising Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian turmoil comes at a time when Exxon's
exploration effort have stalled worldwide and costs to pump oil
and gas from the ground are rising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company found commercial quantities of oil or gas in 67
percent of the exploratory wells it drilled in 2013, unchanged
from 2012, according to the Feb. 26 regulatory filing. At the
same time, Exxon's costs to produce the equivalent of a barrel
of crude jumped to $11.48 last year from $9.91 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Russian drilling rights include 11.3 million acres
in the Kara and Black seas under the agreement with Rosneft, and
another 85,000 offshore acres beneath the Sea of Okhotsk near
Sakhalin Island. Rosneft is a partner in the Sakhalin-1
development, which began producing crude in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) sold $5.5 billion
in its biggest bond offering on record as the world's largest
energy producer by market value ends a more than two-decade
hiatus from the U.S. bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which commands top AAA credit ratings from Moody's
Investors Service and Standard  Poor's, issued fixed- and
floating-rate notes in a five-part sale. The Irving, Texas-based
company may use proceeds to finance capital spending, for
acquisitions and to refinance commercial paper borrowings,
according to a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new securities will add to the company's $22.7 billion
of total debt, which accounted for about 39 percent of its
trailing 12-month cash flow at year-end, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That's a lower leverage level than the
71-percent ratio at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which has similar rankings
of Aaa at Moody's and AAA at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon sold $1 billion of 10-year, 3.176 percent coupon
bonds that yield 48 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1.75 billion of five-year debt with a 1.819 percent
coupon and a yield spread of 25 basis points and $1.5 billion of
three-year, 0.921 percent debt that pays 15 basis points more
than benchmarks. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal also includes $750 million of three-year floating-rate securities that pay four basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate and $500 million of five-year floating-rate debt yielding 15 basis points more than that
benchmark. Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow
from one another, was set at 0.23 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon last issued bonds in 1993, according to Bloomberg
data based on dollar-denominated sales of at least $250 million
and restricted to U.S. units. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell the most in almost two weeks as better-than-forecast
industrial production data overshadowed tension in Ukraine.
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) sold $5.5 billion of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.7 basis points to
65 basis points at 5:37 p.m. in New York, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That's the steepest intraday decline
since March 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors pushed the index lower as factory production in
the U.S. rose in February by the most in six months, boosting
confidence that a firming U.S. economy will bolster companies'
ability to repay debt. The U.S. and the European Union imposed
sanctions on Russia in their worst dispute since the Cold War
after a vote paved the way for President Vladimir Putin to annex
Crimea from Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We know the economy is going in the right direction,'
William Larkin, a fixed-income money manager who helps oversee
about $500 million at Cabot Money Management Inc., said in a
telephone interview from Salem, Massachusetts. Investors are
'focusing on the economic fundamentals right now,' he said.
'This whole thing with Russia is going to have a pretty limited
impact unless sanctions really become powerful.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0.8 percent gain at U.S. manufacturers followed a
revised 0.9 percent slump the prior month, figures from the
Federal Reserve in Washington showed today. The median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.3 percent
advance. Total industrial production rose 0.6 percent, more than
projected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps gauge typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon issued $750 million of three-year, floating-rate
notes that yield 4 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate and $500 million of five-year, floating-rate debt that yields 15 basis points more than Libor, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy producer by market value also
sold $1.75 billion of 1.819 percent, five-year securities that
yield 25 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1
billion of 3.176 percent, 10-year debentures that yield 48 basis
points more than benchmarks and $1.5 billion of 0.921 percent,
three-year notes with a relative yield of 15 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used to finance capital spending, for
acquisitions and to refinance commercial paper borrowings,
according to a regulatory filing today from the Irving, Texas-based company. Corporations sell commercial paper, typically
maturing in 270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such
as rent and salaries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon last issued bonds in 1993, according to Bloomberg
data based on dollar-denominated sales of at least $250 million
and restricted to U.S. units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee
will hold its first meeting led by Chair Janet Yellen, who
succeeded Ben S. Bernanke in February. The central bank has
reduced monthly bond buying to $65 billion from $85 billion in
December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
companies, narrowed 10.7 basis points to 324.1, Bloomberg prices
show. Speculative-grade bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody's
Investors Service and less than BBB- at Standard  Poor's. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
corporate bonds rather than government debt decreased 0.5 basis
point to 100.9, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arjuna Capital, a unit of closely-held Baldwin Brothers
Inc., and environmental activist group As You Sow said today
they dropped the resolution after Exxon agreed to provide
shareholders with details on oilfields and other assets that may
become obsolete as governments around the world restrict carbon
emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Silvestri, a spokesman at Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg BNA ' Exxon Mobil Corp. has agreed to publish a report describing its plans for a future in which market forces and stricter climate regulation may leave some of its carbon reserves unburnable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is the first oil and gas producer in the U.S. to commit to reporting on its risks of stranded assets due to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commitment came in response to a shareholder resolution filed in the fall of 2013 by wealth management firm Arjuna Capital and shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The resolution was withdrawn after months of negotiations with Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have increasingly raised concerns that stranded assets, also known as a 'carbon bubble,' could occur if fossil fuel reserves are suddenly revalued under future government policies for climate change or greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its report, Exxon Mobil will let shareholders know what types of reserves it holds'from deep sea drilling, tar sands or elsewhere'so that 'investors have a better idea of where the risks lie and how well the company can withstand those risks,' Danielle Fugere, As You Sow's president, told Bloomberg BNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'That kind of differentiation is important to shareholders as they decide which company to invest in,' Fugere said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report will also discuss how climate risks could affect Exxon Mobil's capital expenditure plans. The report will be posted on Exxon Mobil's website by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exxon Mobil's Response
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, said she was 'very impressed' by Exxon Mobil's responsiveness to the shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'In the past, they've been seen as a climate denier,' Lamb told Bloomberg BNA. Exxon Mobil seems to be making more of an effort to engage with shareholders on climate change and related issues, 'in part because you can only hide under a rock for so long,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamb said Exxon Mobil made a 'big move' recently when it disclosed to CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that it has included a carbon proxy cost in its long-term business plans since 2007. Exxon Mobil is one of about 30 companies in the U.S. that put an internal price on carbon pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Exxon Mobil invests billions of dollars in energy projects which take decades to plan and execute,' Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told Bloomberg BNA in December. 'Although climate policies remain uncertain today, for the purposes of our business planning we assume that governments will continue to gradually adopt a wide variety of more stringent policies to help stem greenhouse gas emissions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil declined to comment on the shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setting Standard
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Exxon Mobil has the potential to set a standard for other energy companies in terms of what kind of information is important to investors, Fugere said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 10 energy companies, including Chevron Corp., Hess Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., have received similar shareholder resolutions on carbon asset risk so far during the 2014 proxy season. Discussions with these companies are 'in various stages,' with some proposals leaning toward withdrawals, while many of the other resolutions will likely go to a vote, Fugere said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As You Sow filed the first shareholder resolution on carbon asset risk with CONSOL Energy last proxy season. The resolution went to a vote and received about 20 percent support, which is considered high among shareholder resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, CONSOL has divested nearly half of its carbon-heavy coal holdings in favor of less carbon-intensive natural gas, which Fugere said is an indication of where the energy market is going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Companies need to acknowledge that preparing for a low-carbon future is a necessity, not a choice,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Tom Randall" datetime="Mar 21, 2014  1:29 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="h" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-21/exxon-wins-by-having-the-highest-cost-of-climate.html"><headline>High Cost of Climate Earns Exxon Rare Environmental Win</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;For years, Exxon Mobil has walked around with an environmentalist target on its chest. So it was news when the world's biggest oil company by market value agreed to share its plans for dealing with climate change. A look at what we already know about Exxon's climate strategy shows why disclosure may be a savvy move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows how companies estimate the future cost of carbon pollution. Right now, few countries outside Europe regulate it. That's changing and is likely to intensify in the lead-up to key UN climate negotiations in 2015. Some companies use a so-called shadow price to anticipate the future cost from climate policy when planning new projects. Of 30 U.S. companies that use a shadow carbon price, Exxon's is among the most aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) is negotiating to bring OAO Rosneft (ROSN) into oil and gas licenses in Iraq's Kurdistan region, people familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The talks show the largest U.S. and Russian oil companies forging ahead with a global alliance even as relations between the two governments stand at their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. Rosneft is considering the proposal and a deal isn't guaranteed, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft are working on ventures to explore the Arctic Ocean, test the potential of shale oil in Russia and pump crude in Texas. So far, sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union in response to President Vladimir Putin's decision to annex Crimea haven't had an impact on the work of international oil companies in Russia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kurdistan, an autonomous region in northern Iraq, is ramping up oil production and trying to resolve a dispute with the government in Baghdad over pipeline exports. Exxon reduced its stake in one of the biggest oilfields in southern Iraq after moving into Kurdistan, where the power to award exploration licenses has been the subject of dispute between the central and regional administrations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosneft shares rose 0.5 percent to close at 232.6 rubles in Moscow after earlier gaining as much as 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon signed six production-sharing contracts covering more than 848,000 acres in Kurdistan in October 2011, according to the Irving, Texas-based company's 2013 annual report on its website. Exxon began a seismic survey on four of six blocks in 2013 and has begun drilling one well, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sakhalin Island &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Exxon is an important and large partner of Rosneft's in a wide range of projects,' Alexander Kornilov, an oil an gas analyst at Alfa Bank said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Exxon-operated venture with Rosneft at Sakhalin Island plans to begin pumping oil from the Arkutun-Dagi project off Russia's Pacific coast this year, Senior Vice President Mark Albers said on Mar. 5. The companies additionally plan a well in the remote and prospective Russia's Kara Sea this August. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosneft's press service and an Exxon representative in Moscow declined to comment as did an official at the Kurdistan Regional Government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll" datetime="May 01, 2014  4:57 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="h" progress_sentiment="u" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-01/exxon-s-first-quarter-profit-declines-less-than-expected.html"><headline>Exxon's First-Quarter Profit Declines Less Than Expected</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) posted higher-than-expected profit as international sanctions against Russian
interests clouded the U.S. oil explorer's efforts to tap some of
the world's biggest crude reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income was $9.1 billion, or $2.10 a
share, compared with $9.5 billion, or $2.12, a year earlier, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Per-share
profit exceeded all 20 estimates from analysts in a Bloomberg
survey and surpassed the average by 22 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia's oil and gas riches are key to Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson'splans for reviving output at
the world's biggest energy explorer by market value. Exxon's
global production has fallen in 10 of the past 11 quarters and
net income is in the midst of the longest slide since the
worldwide financial crisis of 2008-2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, 62, slashed spending on drilling and
acquisitions outside the U.S. by 41 percent to $5.2 billion and
almost tripled asset sales to amass cash. The balance-sheet
measures helped offset a larger-than-expected 5.6 percent drop
in oil and natural gas production exacerbated by lower crude
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Cash flow looks good and their projects are proceeding on
schedule, so all in all it was a good quarter,' Brian
Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Sons in St. Louis, said
in a telephone interview today. Cost-containment and the absence
of major deals akin to last year's $3.1 billion Celtic
Exploration Ltd. purchase in Canada were a boon, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

Gas prices are displayed as cars drive past an Exxon Mobil Corp. station in Cincinnati.

&lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), Cigna Corp. and Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) all posted profits that topped analysts' estimates
today, as consumer spending surged and the labor market improved
in an otherwise anemic quarter for the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating predictions wasn't enough for professional-networking service LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), whose stock sank in late
trading after its second-quarter sales forecast disappointed.
Expedia Inc. (EXPE) and Wynn Resorts Ltd. also came in higher than
anticipated, leaving the pace at which Standard  Poor's 500
Index first-quarter earnings exceeded estimates at 75 percent
for the season so far, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer spending rose in March by the most in almost five
years as warmer weather brought shoppers back to auto-dealer
lots and malls, a sign the U.S. economy is snapping back after
growth stalled during a harsh winter. Job data released
yesterday also point to a recovery, while manufacturing expanded
in April by the most this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Our tone has been fairly optimistic about the labor
market in the U.S.,' said Jan Siegmund, chief financial officer
at Automatic Data Processing Inc., the private payroll-processing company known as ADP. Job creation is 'solid and
broad-based.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figures from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Research
Institute yesterday showed that companies added more workers in
April than at any time in the previous five months. Among the
bright spots were the South and the oil industry, Siegmund said
in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LinkedIn, Avon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology stocks like LinkedIn, which are valued based on
their growth potential, have taken a hit as investors question
whether the companies can keep up their revenue expansion.
Twitter Inc., among the most expensive Internet stocks, has
declined 39 percent this year and this week reported a slowdown
in user growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two-thirds of SP 500 companies have now reported.
Viacom Inc. (VIAB), ConocoPhillips (COP) and Yelp (YELP) Inc. topped predictions
today, while Avon Products Inc. (AVP) fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the Irving, Texas-based oil company, posted
profit that fell less than analysts anticipated as international
sanctions against Russian interests clouded efforts to tap some
of the world's largest crude reserves. Meanwhile MasterCard, the
second-biggest payments network, benefited from an increase in
customer spending and New York-based Viacom gained from channels
including Comedy Central. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp Inc.'s quarterly loss was smaller than analysts
anticipated and the service for online restaurant and local
business reviews boosted its full-year revenue forecast. The
shares surged 9.8 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies downgraded expectations coming into the season
and two weeks ago analysts predicted that SP 500 earnings
gained just 0.7 percent last quarter while sales rose 2.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As the
reporting season progressed, they raised their estimates back to
3.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, as of April 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's main earnings include Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,
Chevron Corp., CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) and Estee Lauder Cos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in Los Angeles
strengthened against futures for a fifth straight day as Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s Torrance refinery began shutting equipment,
including the crude unit and a coker, for maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant near Los Angeles
has halted catalytic hydrodesulfurization and sulfur recovery
units for the turnaround, Gesuina Paras, a spokeswoman at the
site, said by e-mail today. Work will also be performed on the
crude unit, the alkylation unit, a hydrogen plant and one of the
cokers, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The overall duration of the maintenance is expected to
last several weeks,' Paras said. 'Although we anticipate
impact to production, ExxonMobil expects to be able to meet its
contractual commitments.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles jumped
3 cents to a premium of 30 cents a gallon versus futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 1:29 p.m., the highest
level since Feb. 19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The fuel strengthened 16.5 cents a gallon last week, the biggest
gain since the seven days ended Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles of California-blend gasoline are at a record low
as scheduled refinery repairs and unplanned unit shutdowns cut
production. Inventories declined 11 percent in the week ended
April 26 to 4.01 million barrels, data compiled by the state
Energy Commission show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Valero Wilmington &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fluid catalytic cracker at Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)'s
Wilmington plant has returned to planned rates following a pump
upset May 1, Bill Day, a spokesman at company headquarters in
San Antonio, said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco dropped 6 cents versus futures to a
premium of 22 cents a gallon, the first decline in five days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron's 240,000-barrel-a-day Richmond refinery, the
largest in Northern California, reported flaring last week
related to the restart of its crude unit, which had been shut
since a fire Aug. 6, Melissa Ritchie, a spokeswoman at the
plant, said by e-mail May 3. The refinery is bringing other
units at the complex back online, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco tumbled 9 cents to a discount of 8
cents a gallon against the fuel in Los Angeles, the lowest level
in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional gasoline in Portland, Oregon, gained against
Nymex futures for the sixth straight day, rising 3 cents to a
premium of 42 cents a gallon, the highest level since October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diesel Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-sulfur diesel in Portland strengthened 0.5 cent to a
premium of 4.5 cents a gallon against ultra-low-sulfur diesel
futures on the Nymex, a two-week high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco rose 2
cents to a discount of 3.5 cents against ULSD futures. The same
fuel in Los Angeles slipped 0.25 cent to 4.75 cents a gallon
under futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles widened a fifth
day, gaining 85 cents to $22.15 a barrel at 2:50 p.m. New York
time. The spread, a rough indicator of refinery margins, is at
the highest level in more than a month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, said it will invest more than $4 billion in the
development of its Julia oil field in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil production is expected to start in 2016 from the field,
which was discovered in 2007, Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in
a statement today. The resource in place is estimated to be
almost 6 billion barrels, Exxon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Julia unit was the subject of a 2011 Exxon lawsuit
against the U.S. over the government's decision to cancel the
offshore leases because Exxon hadn't proceeded quickly enough
with development. The litigation was later settled, allowing the
company 'to develop this very large, but technically
challenging, resource as quickly as possible using a phased
approach,' Patrick McGinn, an Exxon spokesman, said in January
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial phase of the project is designed for daily
output of 34,000 barrels of oil, the company said in today's
statement. It will have tie-backs to a production facility
operated by Chevron Corp. (CVX) Exxon and Statoil ASA (STL) both have a 50
percent stake in the Julia unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Julia is one of the first large oil discoveries in the
ultra-deepwater frontier of the Gulf of Mexico,' Neil Duffin,
president of Exxon's development company, said in the statement.
'This resource is located more than 30,000 feet below the
ocean's surface. Enhanced technologies will be deployed to
ensure the safe and environmentally responsible development of
this important energy resource.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest energy
company by market value, signed an agreement with Qatar
Petroleum International to move forward with construction of a
$10 billion natural gas export terminal in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will involve installing liquefaction equipment
at an existing import facility in Sabine Pass, Texas, according
to an e-mailed statement today from Golden Pass Products LLC, a
subsidiary formed by the two companies. It won permission last
year to export the fuel to nations with free-trade agreements
with the U.S. and is awaiting approval to send the fuel to all
other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and state-owned Qatar
Petroleum plan to ship as much as 15.6 million metric tons of
gas annually from the Golden Pass facility, according to the
statement. A boom in U.S. production has spurred several
proposals to export the fuel, which is cooled to liquid form at
-260 degrees Fahrenheit (-162 Celsius) to reduce volume and
allow for transportation by ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'This agreement sets out a highly competitive commercial
blueprint for Golden Pass Products, with a commitment that
builds on the unique combined strengths of QPI and Exxon Mobil
through the the global downstream LNG value chain,' Bill
Collins, president of Golden Pass, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has been expanding its worldwide gas portfolio with
acquisitions such as the 2010 purchase of XTO Energy in the U.S.
and investments in projects that include the A$52 billion ($52
billion) Gorgon LNG complex in Australia. Gas accounted for half
of Exxon's global production during the first three months of
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. liquefied natural gas import facilities have been
operating below capacity as a glut of domestic gas from shale
formations erased demand for foreign supplies. The import
terminal at Golden Pass began operations in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's most
valuable oil producer, teamed up with billionaire Eike Batista
to search in Brazilian waters as the country raised a record
amount in its first oil bidding round in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between the Irving, Texas-based company,
which failed to make major discoveries in previous exploration
efforts in Brazil, and Batista's OGX Petroleo  Gas
Participacoes SA won rights for one offshore block in the
Potiguar basin and another in Ceara. The so-called Round 11
auction staged by regulator ANP yesterday also saw BP Plc (BP/) and
Total SA, Europe's biggest producers after Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA), win licenses off Amapa state in the largest single bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, home to the biggest crude discovery in the Americas
in more than 30 years, raised a record 2.8 billion reais ($1.4
billion) by selling licenses at 142 of the 289 blocks for sale.
Exxon returns to the country while Total expands into the Foz do
Amazonas basin bordering French Guiana and BG Group Plc becomes
an operator for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The competition was stronger than I expected,' Joao Carlos de Luca, the head of the Brazilian Oil Institute, told
reporters in Rio de Janeiro. 'We have great new operators in
the country. The return of Exxon is an important factor.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil's first sale of oil permits since 2008 will give
Exxon a chance to resume exploration in the country after it
drilled dry holes and returned a license last year in the so-called pre-salt region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which also explored Foz de Amazonas in 2001 and
2002, will have a 50 percent interest in the two new blocks it
won with OGX and will operate both, spokesman Patrick McGinn
said by telephone, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30 winning companies will invest a minimum of 6.9
billion reais to develop the areas that span 11 sedimentary
basins on land and off the coast of north and northeastern
Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between Total, BP and state-run Petroleo
Brasileiro SA made the largest single bid of 346 million reais
for the FZA-M-57 block in deep waters of Foz do Amazonas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The super consortium that took shape for the equatorial
margin is Total, BP and Petrobras,' de Luca said, noting that
Total will operate the block. 'Petrobras teaming up with other
companies is very good for the sector.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Acted Aggressively' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista's OGX, the Rio de Janeiro-based company that lost
87 percent of its market value in the past year, also won
licenses for 10 blocks in five basins bidding without partners
and an additional 30 percent stake in a block together with
Total and QGEP Participacoes SA. (QGEP3) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX is taking on new exploration projects even as the
company sells stakes in fields, reduces staff and cuts costs
after losing investor confidence amid missed production targets.
Brazil's worst-performing stock last year has plunged an
additional 60 percent this year after lower-than-expected output
rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX agreed to pay 377 million reais for the exploration
licenses, including its share in blocks won with partners,
according to ANP data. The company missed out on rights in four
other blocks where offers were presented in conjunction with
Exxon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Once again the company acted aggressively, which is a
characteristic of OGX and of Eike Batista,' Adriano Pires, the
head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, a consulting
firm in Rio de Janeiro, said in a telephone interview. 'Nobody
expected that given the complicated situation the company is
having lately. They took onshore and offshore blocks.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Absence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carneiro, present at the
auction event, declined to comment. OGX shares rose 5.4 percent
to 1.76 reais at the close in Sao Paulo yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners of the auction, held at a Rio hotel, also included
Brazilian startup Ouro Preto Oleo  Gas SA and Colombia's
Ecopetrol SA. (ECOPETL) Chief oil regulator Magda Chambriard told
reporters she was surprised by a lack of bids from Chinese
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Total agreed to pay 621.5 million reais for the
offshore Amazon basin concessions. BHP Billiton Ltd. won bidding
for two blocks in the same basin, the Melbourne-based mining
company's first oil assets in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the areas auctioned yesterday are in virgin waters
off the coast of northeastern Brazil where discoveries in
similar geology across the Atlantic in Ghana and Ivory Coast
yielded major discoveries. Tullow Oil Plc in 2011 sparked
interest in the region with the Zaedyus find off the coast of
French Guiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The bidding has been aggressive,' Thore Kristiansen,
head of Statoil ASA in Brazil, told reporters after the
Stavanger-based company won blocks in ventures with Petrobras
and Total. 'The bidding has shown it's been five years since

&lt;p&gt;Oil Search Ltd. (OSH), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s
partner in a $19 billion liquefied natural gas export project in
Papua New Guinea, expects shipments to Asia to start shortly
with the initial cargoes sold on the spot market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process to load the first LNG tanker has begun, with a
decision on when the ship will leave to be made over the next
few days, Managing Director Peter Botten said today by phone
from Port Moresby, the Pacific nation's capital. The first gas
is expected to go to Tokyo Electric Power Co., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The project is a platform for a significant corporate
transformation for Oil Search,' he said. On the timing for the
first ship to leave PNG, 'we're being cautious about the date
but at the end of the day it will take place shortly,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gas project in Papua New Guinea will allow Oil Search
to fund expansion opportunities and pay higher dividends, the
Port Moresby-based company has said. Seven other LNG ventures
are going ahead in neighboring Australia to meet Asian demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, whose Australian project started producing LNG last
month and ahead of schedule, expects the Papua New Guinea
development to spur more foreign investment in the country,
Peter Graham, Exxon Mobil PNG Ltd.'s managing director, said
today in an e-mailed copy of a speech he gave in the Pacific
nation. The departure of the first LNG vessel, the Spirit of
Hela, is just days away, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first series of LNG cargoes from the project will be
sold at spot prices, with the development progressively moving
into contract deliveries, Oil Search's Botten said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spot Pricing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Spot pricing at the moment is pretty healthy,' he said.
'That could change over the coming months, but we are seeing
good pricing achievable at spot.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northeast Asia spot LNG was at $14.15 per million British
thermal units in the week ended May 5, the New York-based Energy
Intelligence Group said on the website of its World Gas
Intelligence publication. Prices earlier this year had more than
doubled since the Fukushima accident of March 2011, as Japanese
utilities rely on other fuel such as LNG to help replace lost
nuclear power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Search is also moving ahead with drilling in Iraq's
Kurdistan region at its Taza oil project, which has attracted
interest from potential partners, Botten said. The company
expects to complete its evaluation of the size of that resource,
in which it has a 60 percent holding, by the second half of next
year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There has been strong interest from a number of parties
to potentially join us in Taza,' Botten said. 'Our view is we
would like to understand what the resource base is before
looking potentially at crystallizing any further value.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three oil fields operated by Exxon
Mobil (XOM) Corp. in the Norwegian North Sea could be shut by a strike
if mediation with a union over pensions fails, cutting about
50,000 barrels of crude output a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Safe union will order as many as 154 offshore-platform
workers to walk out if the talks fail, paralyzing production at
the Ringhorne, Jotun and Balder fields, the group's leader
Hilde-Marit Rysst said by phone. Though the date for a possible
walkout has been set at June 16, a strike could start earlier or
later, depending on the date of the mediation, which has yet to
be scheduled, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We expect Exxon to take the hint,' Rysst said. 'We
expect this to be dealt with either before or during the
mediation.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe and another oil-worker union broke off talks over
pensions last week, raising the risk of a strike two years after
the same issue triggered the longest ever labor action by
platform employees and reduced output by western Europe's
biggest oil and gas producer. The government used its power to
stop the strike as a lockout by oil companies threatened to shut
production entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three Exxon fields, including satellite Ringhorne East,
produced about 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 2013, according to
figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has a 100 percent stake in the Balder and Ringhorne
fields, while it holds 77.4 percent in Ringhorne East, which is
tied in to the Balder and Jotun installations. Exxon holds 45
percent in Jotun, where other partners include Dana Petroleum
Plc with 45 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe is targeting Exxon specifically because the company
has yet to implement an early-pension plan for 31 employees that
are members of the union, it said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pension plan isn't an issue that should be discussed in
wage talks, Exxon spokesman Knut Riple said by phone, echoing
the position held by the organization representing employers,
the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. Exxon declined to say
whether there was room to meet Safe's demands, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's most
valuable oil producer, teamed up with billionaire Eike Batista
to search in Brazilian waters as the country raised a record
amount in its first oil bidding round in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between the Irving, Texas-based company,
which failed to make major discoveries in previous exploration
efforts in Brazil, and Batista's OGX Petroleo  Gas
Participacoes SA won rights for one offshore block in the
Potiguar basin and another in Ceara. The so-called Round 11
auction staged by regulator ANP yesterday also saw BP Plc (BP/) and
Total SA, Europe's biggest producers after Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA), win licenses off Amapa state in the largest single bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil, home to the biggest crude discovery in the Americas
in more than 30 years, raised a record 2.8 billion reais ($1.4
billion) by selling licenses at 142 of the 289 blocks for sale.
Exxon returns to the country while Total expands into the Foz do
Amazonas basin bordering French Guiana and BG Group Plc becomes
an operator for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The competition was stronger than I expected,' Joao Carlos de Luca, the head of the Brazilian Oil Institute, told
reporters in Rio de Janeiro. 'We have great new operators in
the country. The return of Exxon is an important factor.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil's first sale of oil permits since 2008 will give
Exxon a chance to resume exploration in the country after it
drilled dry holes and returned a license last year in the so-called pre-salt region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Investment Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which also explored Foz de Amazonas in 2001 and
2002, will have a 50 percent interest in the two new blocks it
won with OGX and will operate both, spokesman Patrick McGinn
said by telephone, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30 winning companies will invest a minimum of 6.9
billion reais to develop the areas that span 11 sedimentary
basins on land and off the coast of north and northeastern
Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A partnership between Total, BP and state-run Petroleo
Brasileiro SA made the largest single bid of 346 million reais
for the FZA-M-57 block in deep waters of Foz do Amazonas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The super consortium that took shape for the equatorial
margin is Total, BP and Petrobras,' de Luca said, noting that
Total will operate the block. 'Petrobras teaming up with other
companies is very good for the sector.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Acted Aggressively' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batista's OGX, the Rio de Janeiro-based company that has
lost 84 percent of its market value in the past year, also won
licenses for 10 blocks in five basins bidding without partners
and an additional 30 percent stake in a block together with
Total and QGEP Participacoes SA. (QGEP3) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX is taking on new exploration projects even as the
company sells stakes in fields, reduces staff and cuts costs
after losing investor confidence amid missed production targets.
Brazil's worst-performing stock last year has plunged an
additional 57 percent this year after lower-than-expected output
rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX agreed to pay 377 million reais for the exploration
licenses, including its share in blocks won with partners,
according to ANP data. The company missed out on rights in four
other blocks where offers were presented in conjunction with
Exxon. OGX committed 16 percent of its cash to the new licenses,
according to Banco Santander SA analysts Christian Audi and
Vicente Falanga Neto. The Rio-based company would be better
served focusing on development of its existing assets, they
wrote in a note to clients dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China Absence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Once again the company acted aggressively, which is a
characteristic of OGX and of Eike Batista,' Adriano Pires, the
head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, a consulting
firm in Rio de Janeiro, said in a telephone interview. 'Nobody
expected that given the complicated situation the company is
having lately. They took onshore and offshore blocks.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX Chief Executive Officer Luiz Carneiro said in an e-mailed statement today the acquired offshore blocks are located
in a 'highly promising area.' 'This is clearly an exciting
time for Brazil's oil and gas industry,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OGX rose 6.8 percent to 1.88 reais in Sao Paulo today, the
highest close since May 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winners of the auction, held at a Rio hotel, also included
Brazilian startup Ouro Preto Oleo  Gas SA and Colombia's
Ecopetrol SA. (ECOPETL) Chief oil regulator Magda Chambriard told
reporters she was surprised by a lack of bids from Chinese
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Amazon Basin &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and Total agreed to pay 621.5 million reais for the
offshore Amazon basin concessions. BHP Billiton Ltd. won bidding
for two blocks in the same basin, the Melbourne-based mining
company's first oil assets in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the areas auctioned yesterday are in virgin waters
off the coast of northeastern Brazil where discoveries in
similar geology across the Atlantic in Ghana and Ivory Coast
yielded major discoveries. Tullow Oil Plc in 2011 sparked
interest in the region with the Zaedyus find off the coast of
French Guiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The bidding has been aggressive,' Thore Kristiansen,
head of Statoil ASA in Brazil, told reporters after the
Stavanger-based company won blocks in ventures with Petrobras
and Total. 'The bidding has shown it's been five years since
the last auction. There's an industry willing to take risks.' &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s
Pegasus crude oil pipeline, shut since March 29 after a spill,
remain in place after the company requested changes in a hearing
held on May 2, according to a filing from federal regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon told the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration that a 211-mile (340-kilometer) southern section
of the pipeline presented less risk because it was constructed
more recently than the northern leg that spilled about 5,000
barrels of oil near Mayflower, Arkansas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulators pointed out at the hearing that the newer
section, built in 1954, and had a seam failure during a prior
hydrostatic test, according to a decision from Jeffrey Wiese,
associate administrator for pipeline safety. The corrective
action order preventing the line's restart was kept in place,
with modifications to future limitations on pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 30, Exxon found a second leak on Pegasus in
Doniphan, Missouri. The shutdown of the line, which delivers
about 96,000 barrels a day to Gulf Coast refineries from Patoka,
Illinois, helped back up oil supplies in the central U.S. Exxon
hasn't provided a timeline for restarting Pegasus or filed a
plan with federal regulators to return it to service. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) isn't responsible
for alligators overrunning a rural dump site it owns in
Mississippi, the state supreme court ruled, because the global
oil explorer can't control wild animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family that felt menaced by the scaly reptiles
infesting a plot next door to their 35-acre property couldn't
prove where the gators originated, Justice Ann Lamar wrote for
the majority in the court's 5-4 decision yesterday. The family
had alleged the alligators were brought to the site from
Louisiana by a previous owner who later sold the land to Exxon,
according to the court document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mississippi Supreme Court threw out the family's 2008
lawsuit, citing a 1950 ruling that no one can be held
responsible for animals 'in a state of nature.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court ruled the alligators -- which numbered 84 when
the state's wildlife agency counted them in 2007 -- were wild
animals and, as such, not under Exxon's control. Even if Exxon
had wanted to cull the congregation, it would have been
prevented by state law that designates alligators as a protected
species, making it illegal to hunt or disturb them, according to
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision reinstates a lower-court ruling in Exxon's
favor that had been reversed on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state supreme court didn't say what sort of waste was
disposed of at the dump. Exxon was the sole customer of the site
from 1984 to 2001, when the Irving, Texas-based company
purchased it from Rogers Rental  Landfill Company, according to
the court document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Horse Incident &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Consandra Christmas bought the adjacent tract in
2003, even after their real estate agent warned them his horse
had been injured in a suspected alligator encounter, the court
said in yesterday's decision. The couple said they didn't
realize the Exxon land was crawling with gators until 2007, when
Tom Christmas went to retrieve a dog that had wandered onto the
site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas testified that he lost two calves and one dog and
suspected that alligators were responsible, according to the
opinion. He said he was afraid to fish in the ponds due to the
alligators. The couple asked for monetary damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four justices dissented from the ruling, citing testimony
that Exxon assigned staff to feed the 6- to-10 foot reptiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dick Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said the company hadn't yet
had an opportunity to peruse the ruling and declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Christmas v. Exxon Mobil, 2011-CT-01311-SCT,
Supreme Court of Mississippi. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's state-owned oil company and
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s local unit may decide to tap the bond market
in 2016 as an alternative source of funding for their joint
venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The challenge of today is that a lot of people are going
into the bank market, and the avenue is being crowded, making it
difficult for us to obtain sufficient funding,' Mobil Producing
Nigeria's Chief Financial Officer Segun Banwo said in a
statement on the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.'s website.
'From the years 2013 to 2015, we will continue to use the
external financing option, but by the year 2016 we would switch
to the bond market.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the second-largest producer in Nigeria, is the
operator of a joint venture in which it holds a 40 percent
stake, with NNPC holding the rest. The company has daily output
capacity of about 550,000 barrels of crude from 90 offshore
platforms and about 300 oil wells, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon in June said it concluded a $1.5 billion financing
arrangement with NNPC, with a $900 million loan sourced from a
group of Nigerian and international banks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PetroChina Co. (857), the country's biggest
oil and gas producer, will seek to increase cooperation with
companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) as it looks to add overseas resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beijing-based company will also seek to work with Eni
SpA (ENI) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) as its makes expansion abroad a priority,
Chairman Zhou Jiping told reporters today in Beijing. The
cooperation could involve teaming up to make acquisitions or
joint exploration activities, Mao Zefeng, the company's Beijing-based spokesman said after the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina and its state-owned parent China National
Petroleum Corp. have announced plans to spend about $7 billion
in the past six months on assets from Mozambique to Australia,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zhou was appointed as
chairman in April after Jiang Jiemin was promoted to the
minister of China's state-owned enterprises supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicly traded unit plans to invest at least $60
billion this decade in global oil and natural gas assets to
increase the share of overseas output to half of its total,
former Chairman Jiang Jiemin said in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina fell 2.2 percent to HK$9:50 as of 11:59 am in
Hong Kong. The stock has dropped 13 percent this year, compared
with a 1 percent gain at the city's benchmark Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) extended its
partnership with Russia's state-controlled oil company even as
U.S. and European nations threaten additional sanctions to
punish Vladimir Putin's regime for its actions in Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon signed the agreement with OAO Rosneft (ROSN) Chief Executive
Officer Igor Sechin at a forum in St. Petersburg today,
extending a pact that involves drilling for crude in the Arctic
and Siberia and liquefying natural gas for export in Russia's
Far East, according to a statement on Moscow-based Rosneft's
website. Exxon didn't immediately return a phone message seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is among American oil producers that rebuffed U.S.
State Department pressure to skip the International Economic
Forum this week in Putin's hometown. With at least $30 billion
already invested in Russia's oil and gas sector, U.S. and
European explorers are betting the Ukraine crisis won't derail
their aspirations to capture some of Russia's 75 billion barrels
of reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among U.S. companies, Irving, Texas-based Exxon is the
biggest player in Russia, where it has a series of joint
ventures with Rosneft. (ROSN) It already produces oil in Russia's Far
East with Rosneft and the two companies plan to start drilling
an exploration well in the Kara Sea this year. Together they
hold licenses to explore huge swathes of the Arctic Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stronger Action &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sanctions against Russia have targeted individuals --
including Sechin -- and avoided industrywide measures, the U.S.
has threatened stronger action if Putin's government obstructs
the Ukraine presidential election scheduled for May 25.
Producers still plan to invest more in Russia, pursuing
exploration in the Arctic Ocean and drilling shale oil fields in
Siberia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Foreign companies are expected to invest billions of
dollars in Russian projects,' said Timur Salikhov, an oil and
gas analyst at BCS Financial Group. 'I don't think many of them
will do so until there is resolution to the ongoing standoff
with Ukraine.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European energy producers hold equity partnerships
in Russian oil and gas worth at least $30 billion, according to
Alexander Nazarov, an analyst at OAO Gazprombank in Moscow. The
investments are led by BP Plc (BP/)'s almost 20 percent stake in
Rosneft, Total SA (FP)'s stake in gas producer OAO Novatek (NVTK) and a gas
project operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some oil-industry leaders declined to attend this week's
forum after U.S. officials called for a boycott. Others came
anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christophe de Margerie, CEO of France's Total, was at the
forum, where he signed an agreement with OAO Lukoil to seek
shale oil in Western Siberia. BP CEO Bob Dudley attended the
meeting and said he had no plans to exit Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Duffin, president of Exxon's development unit, signed
the agreement today at the forum, according to Rosneft. Exxon
has declined to say whether CEO Rex Tillerson will make an
appearance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InterOil Corp. (IOC), the Australian energy
company with licenses to explore about 3.9 million acres, said
it entered exclusive talks with Exxon Mobil Corp. to develop
natural gas fields in Papua New Guinea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the talks is the potential sale of a stake in
Petroleum Retention License 15, which comprises the Elk and
Antelope fields, that is sufficient to supply gas to develop an
additional liquefied natural gas train, Cairns-based InterOil
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InterOil and Pacific LNG Group, its joint-venture partner,
may also get funding for more wells in the fields. The fields
hold an estimated 9 trillion cubic feet of recoverable sales
gas, InterOil said in its 2012 annual report. The company had
spent $384 million on the fields through March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made before the start of regular
trading in New York. InterOil rose 9.1 percent to $102 at 7:34

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), operator of a $19
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, is
talking to customers in Asia about selling cargoes on the spot
market as demand traditionally rises over summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon expects an LNG cargo from the project every four to
six days, Decie Autin, Exxon's project executive in Papua New
Guinea, said today in a a phone interview. The next shipment
will go to CPC Corp. of Taiwan, she said. The first one has left
the country headed to Tokyo Electric Power Co. in Japan, Exxon
said earlier today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'There are a few other customers we're talking to, and
Asia is clearly the focus,' she said. 'We'll sell on the spot
market until we're comfortable we've got reliable, sustainable
sales. We're not seeing any issues with placing our cargoes.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot LNG prices in northeast Asia fell to $13.50 a million
British thermal units, their lowest since October 2012, in the
week to May 19, according to World Gas Intelligence assessments
of cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks published May 21.
They reached $19.70 in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and its partners, including Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) and
Santos Ltd. (STO), are considering expansion of the development to tap
Asian demand. Exxon is focused on exploration to underpin an
expansion rather than trying to obtain gas from InterOil Corp.'s
Elk and Antelope gas discoveries, Autin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos rose 1.1 percent to close at A$14.36 in Sydney
trading, while Oil Search climbed 1.1 percent to A$9.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA and InterOil want to build a second export
development in Papua New Guinea based on gas from the Elk and
Antelope fields. Oil Search also agreed earlier this year to
acquire part of those fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'It looks like they have a deal, it looks like they're
building a greenfield facility, and to my knowledge, that's a

of a lot of opportunity there' for Exxon, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Search has contested Total's agreement to buy part of
InterOil's project, saying the deal breached its pre-emptive
rights. The possibility of Oil Search blocking Total sparked
speculation Exxon could enter the Elk and Antelope license. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LNG market will remain tight until at least 2015,
according to the International Energy Agency. Spot and short-term LNG trade increased to 27.4 percent of the total last year
from 25 percent in 2012, according to the International Group of
Liquefied Natural Gas Importers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importers typically purchase more spot shipments in June
through September to meet increased power needs amid hotter
weather during summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon project is expected to reach full capacity in
four to six weeks, Autin said. The development has long-term
contracts with four major customers, Tokyo Electric Power, CPC,
Osaka Gas Co. and China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) reported flaring at refineries on the U.S.
West Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP's 234,000-barrel-a-day Cherry Point plant in Washington
said there were emissions from the No. 1 diesel unit on May 25,
a federal regulatory notice showed. Exxon's 150,000-barrel-a-day
Torrance refinery in Southern California reported planned
flaring yesterday, according to a notice to the California
Emergency Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), which this month extended its partnership with Russia's OAO Rosneft (ROSN), hasn't had to change its business in the country amid Ukraine-related sanctions and said such steps are typically ineffective. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't find them to be effective unless they are very well implemented,' Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said today during a shareholders meeting in Dallas. Authorities imposing the sanctions should consider 'who are they really harming?' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon is among American oil producers that ignored U.S. State Department recommendations to skip an energy forum in St. Petersburg last week as it extended a pact with Rosneft involving drilling for crude in the Arctic and Siberia. Exxon, through a 2011 deal with the state-run crude producer, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million acres of Russian land, including vast swaths of the Kara Sea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European nations have imposed sanctions to punish Vladimir Putin's regime for its actions in Ukraine. Among those targeted was Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin. Measures from President Barack Obama's administration included asset freezes and bans on travel to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Travel Ban &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The travel ban on Sechin has so far not affected collaboration with Exxon, which is currently working with Rosneft to drill an exploratory well in the Arctic this year, Tillerson said. The companies' partnership gives Rosneft the ability to buy stakes in Exxon's North American projects in exchange for Exxon's access to the Russian Arctic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We have plenty of meetings with them in Russia,' Tillerson said.

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's
largest energy company by market value, is boosting exploration
for oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico five years after dismissing
the region as too costly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technological breakthroughs in seismic imaging have enabled
Exxon's geologists and engineers to more thoroughly assess
subsea crude deposits that previously eluded them in the deepest
parts of the Gulf, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson said in a meeting with reporters in Dallas today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We've re-entered in a very active way the Gulf of
Mexico,' Tillerson said. His comments followed the Irving,
Texas-based company's annual shareholders meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2008, Tillerson said the discoveries being made in
the Gulf weren't large enough to justify the costs of erecting
production platforms and installing pipelines. Energy explorers
needed to 'cobble together' individual discoveries to make
pumping oil and natural gas to the surface profitable, he said
at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responsible Investor ' ExxonMobil, one of the oil companies whose stance on climate change disclosure has been under scrutiny from investors, has revealed that it expects the implied cost of CO2 emissions to reach $80 per metric ton [tonne] in 2040 in developed economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes as major institutional investors backed a shareholder proposal calling on Exxon to set quantitative goals for reducing its emissions at its annual meeting in Dallas yesterday (May 28).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motion ' filed by the Sisters of St. Dominic of New Jersey ' was supported by investors including the AFSCME Employees Pension Plan, the California Public Employees Retirement System, the Florida State Board of Administration, FC and Dutch giant PGGM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FC said that while it appreciates the company's recent disclosures around climate change challenges ' prompted by an investor campaign spearheaded by Ceres and Carbon Tracker ' nevertheless 'climate change presents ongoing and serious risks to shareholder value and there is room for the company to improve its transparency'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'In the absence of a viable price for carbon, setting a greenhouse gas reduction target would demonstrate a stronger strategy for operating in carbon-constrained markets,' FC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil had resisted the Sisters of St. Dominic resolution, saying it already provides extensive public disclosure on its approach to managing the risks of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full voting results haven't yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon released the $80 figure in its latest corporate responsibility report, saying OECD countries are 'likely to continue to lead the way' in adopting greenhouse gas reduction policies ' with developing nations gradually following, led by China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'To help model the potential impacts of a broad mosaic of future GHG policies, we use a simple cost of carbon as a proxy mechanism,' Exxon says in the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $80/tonne figure by 2040 compares with a $60/tonne number ' albeit for 2030 ' that Exxon disclosed in the same report last year. Peer companies such as BP and Shell typically refer to current price assumptions of $40/tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has also revealed that two responsible investment figures have 'transitioned out' of its social and environmental expert panel. Both Tim Smith of Walden Asset Management and Elizabeth McGeveran, former Senior Vice President of Governance  Sustainable Investment at FC, have left its External Citizenship Advisory Panel, replaced by Frank Loy, the former US Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, and Sarah Labowitz, co-director of the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University's Stern School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Republished with the permission of Responsible Investor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit The Grid for the latest about energy, natural resources and global business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North American shale explorers led by
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and BP Plc (BP/) are failing to disclose enough data
on how they're reducing risks associated with hydraulic
fracturing, according to a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Hydraulic fracturing operations are under intense
scrutiny for potential harm to neighboring communities and the
environment -- from air and water pollution to increased noise,
traffic and crime,' Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow
Foundation, a non-profit focused on environmental and corporate
responsibility, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No company disclosed information on even half of the 32
indicators that investors need to assess business risk, the
report showed. Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, and London-based
BP placed near the bottom of 24 companies evaluated. Encana
Corp. (ECA), the best performer, provided information on only 14 of
the 32 indicators. Only one company, Chevron Corp. (CVX), quantified
its reductions in the use of toxic chemicals and it failed in 29
other categories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, cracks rock with a
mixture of millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals so
oil and natural gas will flow. Coupled with horizontal drilling
that exposes thousands of feet of petroleum-bearing rock to well
bores, it has revived growth in U.S. oil and gas production.
Checklist items in today's report range from the absence of
diesel fuels in fracturing fluids to traffic congestion policy
and disclosure of fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report was released by Boston Common Asset Management
LLC, Green Century (GCEQX) Capital Management Inc., Investor
Environmental Health Network and As You Sow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reduce Disruptions &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that disclose steps to reduce disruptions by
fracking 'will reduce regulatory and reputational risks;
enhance their likelihood of securing and maintaining their
social license to operate; reduce liabilities associated with
poor performance, spills, contamination, and lawsuits; and
thereby increase their access to capital,' the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the co-authors was Richard Liroff of Investor
Environmental Health Network, whose 2011 report on fracking was
the basis for the checklist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Investors thrive on quantitative information,' Liroff
said today in a phone interview. 'It gives us a sense of the
extent to which various practices are being adopted that can,
one, reduce environmental risk and community impact and, two,
save the companies money.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report defined disclosure as public information on
company websites and financial statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As You Sow is based in Oakland, California, Boston Common (BCAMX)
Asset Management and Green Century are based in Boston and the
Investor Environmental Health Network is based in Falls Church,

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported a stake in Exxon Mobil Corp. valued at about $3.7 billion as Warren Buffett's company disclosed its largest new holding since adding International Business Machines Corp. in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett's company owned 40.1 million shares of Exxon on Sept. 30, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said today in a regulatory filing. The world's biggest oil company by market value closed at $93.22 today in New York. It rose to $93.90 in extended trading at 5:14 p.m., after the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Berkshire has benefited this year as its stock picks rallied along with the broader market, affirming a strategy of favoring equities instead of bonds amid near record-low interest rates. Buffett has tracked Exxon and bought its stock in the past, holding a stake in the Irving, Texas-based energy producer as recently as 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil 'is undervalued, in his opinion, and pretty much being ignored by the market,' said David Kass, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business who has taken students to meet Buffett in Omaha. 'He knows the company. He knows it well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About three-quarters of the Exxon holding was added in the three months ended June 30, according to a separate filing today. Berkshire requested confidential treatment in an August filing listing its holdings at the end of the second quarter. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sometimes allows companies to withhold information from the public to limit copycat investing while they build or cut a position. &lt;/p&gt;

after agreeing to pay HK$14 billion ($1.8 billion) for stakes in
two Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLP will pay HK$12 billion for a 30 percent stake in Castle
Peak Power Co., which owns three plants in Hong Kong, the

Castle Peak to China Southern Power Grid Co., owner of China's
second largest power distribution network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal tops CLP's $1.69 billion purchase of Australian
natural gas and electricity assets in 2005 from Singapore Power
Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. CLP doesn't
expect the transaction to affect customer bills in the near

&lt;p&gt;'The purchase will improve the operation of our generation
business and the integration with power distribution,' Yuen
said today at a media conference in Hong Kong. 'It'll also
increase our cooperation with China Southern and could create
opportunities for partnerships in the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CLP gained 0.7 percent to HK$62.15 at the close in Hong
Kong, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;

biggest oil and gas producer, agreed to buy a 25 percent stake
in Iraq's West Qurna 1 field from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakeholders in the field, which also include Royal
Dutch Shell and Oil Exploration Co. of Iraq, own contracts to
drill for oil. PetroChina's interest will allow it to 'achieve
synergies with its other projects in Iraq' and 'develop a
larger and stronger presence in the upstream operations in the
Middle East,' the Beijing-based company said in a statement. It
didn't disclose how much it's paying for the stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Qurna 1 is near the Rumaila field run by BP Plc (BP/) and
China National Petroleum Corp., PetroChina's state-owned parent.
Exxon's 60 percent stake in the field could be worth $3 billion,
according to an August estimate by Neil Beveridge, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'PetroChina has all the expertise in developing mature
fields at a relatively low cost,' said Shi Yan, an analyst with
UOB-Kay Hian Ltd. 'They have several projects in the southern
part of the country and collectively they can find a way to
deploy their equipment and crew members more effectively.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNPC produces about 1.65 million barrels of oil a day from
its Iraqi projects, the company said in October 2012. Exxon, the
world's biggest oil company by market value, planned to produce
about 600,000 barrels of oil per day by the end of 2013, Madhi
Abdul Razzak, head of the Joint Management Committee for the
oilfield, said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Eglinton, Exxon's Houston-based spokesman, didn't
immediately respond to an e-mail after hours seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iraq, home to the world's fifth-largest crude reserves, is
producing 3.3 million barrels a day and in August exported 2.58
million barrels a day, Deputy Prime Minister for Energy Affairs
Hussain al Shahristani said in a September interview. Export
capacity will exceed 6 million barrels a day once four offshore
plants are operating next year and terminals in the south are
upgraded, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's most

Mexicanos as Mexico's oil industry opens to private investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Pemex, as the state-owned producer is known,
signed a three-year memorandum of understanding and cooperation
to exchange academic, scientific and technical knowledge,
according to e-mailed statements by both companies. The
companies agreed to analyze exploration, drilling and refining
opportunities, according to Pemex's statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based company joins a growing list of
major oil producers to express interest in entering Mexico's
energy industry, which is ending a 76-year state oil monopoly.
Congress passed legislation last year to allow private companies
to tap the country's 13.4 billion barrels of proven reserves,
which the government estimates will bring in $50 billion of
investment between 2015 and 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX), Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) and BHP Billiton Ltd. are

&lt;p&gt;The premium for Los Angeles gasoline
widened versus futures for the first time in seven days as
refineries operated by Tesoro Corp. (TSO) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
reported upsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro's 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle plant in
Northern California reported a small fire in a crude unit Oct.
26, a notice to Contra Costa county regulators showed. The blaze
didn't damage equipment or affect the refinery's ability to meet
supply commitments, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro's
headquarters in San Antonio, said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant in Southern
California reported a breakdown that caused emissions early
today, a notice to the South Coast Air Quality Management
District showed. The refinery said in a separate notice that it
plans to flare gases tomorrow through Nov. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles broadened 2.25 cents to 9.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
differential in four days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg at 1:50 p.m. New York time. Prompt delivery slipped
0.86 cent to $2.6742 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in San Francisco strengthened 2.25 cents against
futures to a discount of 1.5 cents a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tesoro Flaring &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson section of Tesoro's Los
Angeles refinery reported plans to flare from Nov. 1 to Nov. 7,
a notice to the South Coast air agency showed. The flaring is
associated with work that won't affect the company's ability to
meet commitments, Barbee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
a benchmark for the U.S. Pacific Northwest, was unchanged at 13
cents a gallon below futures. Diesel in Portland was unchanged
at 18.5 cents a gallon above ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
traded on the Nymex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discounts for California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los
Angeles and San Francisco held at 1.75 cents and 3.25 cents a
gallon, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3-2-1 crack spread of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed $1.70 a
barrel to $10.24. The spread, a rough indicator of refining
profitability, is the smallest in more than three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

dwindling refining returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's oil and natural gas output rose 1.5 percent to the
equivalent of 4.02 million barrels a day, the first increase
since the second quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Crude prices also climbed, raising costs and
contributing to an 81 percent plunge in profit at the company's
refineries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'They were hurt on the cost side,' said Ernie Cecilia,
who helps manage $7 billion, including Exxon shares, as chief
investment officer at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr,
Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell to $7.87 billion, or $1.79 a share, from
$9.57 billion, or $2.09, a year earlier, Irving, Texas-based
Exxon said in a statement today. The per-share result was 2
cents higher than the average of 21 analysts' estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average of 30 blue-chip stocks today. The shares rose 0.9
percent to $89.62 at the close in New York. Sales declined by
2.4 percent to $112.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refining Crude &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from processing crude into fuels fell to $592
million during the quarter from $3.19 billion a year earlier,
according to the statement. Returns from oil and gas sales rose
12 percent to $6.7 billion and chemical profit climbed 30
percent to $1.03 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. profit margins from refining oil into products such as
gasoline and diesel declined 43 percent to an average of $17.54
a barrel during the July-to-September period as the cost of U.S.
crude feed stocks rose. It was the first time the average
quarterly spread fell below $20 since late 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has been processing output from its Kearl oil-sands development in western Canada at plants in Joliet,
Illinois; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Sarnia, Ontario, David Rosenthal, vice president of investor relations, said during a
conference call with analysts today. Some of the Kearl
production also has been sold to other refiners, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is
seeking to revive production growth and curb cost increases amid
stagnant energy demand in the world's largest economy and
shrinking access to the world's remaining untapped crude
reservoirs. The company's growth prospects include gas-export
developments in Australia and Papua New Guinea, oil-sands
production in western Canada and Arctic forays in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Less Downtime &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output in the quarter rose on the contributions from new
projects and less downtime at existing projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon stock has languished among the poorest performers of
the world's largest oil producers, advancing 2.6 percent this
year to yesterday, less than one-third the gain of its largest
rival Chevron Corp. (CVX) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world's oil, were little changed during the quarter from a year
earlier, trading at an average price of $109.65 a barrel. The
premier U.S. crude, West Texas Intermediate, rose 15 percent to
average $105.81-a-barrel average in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas climbed by 23 percent to $3.555 per
million British thermal units from $2.893 a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gas accounted for about
49 percent of the company's worldwide reserves at the end of
2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boost Production &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, 61, has been telling investors and analysts
since March that output from Exxon's wells will decline by 1
percent this year before new projects boost production as much
as 3 percent annually through 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is the second-to-last major non-state oil producer to
report third-quarter results. Earlier today, Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) said net income declined 35 percent and Total SA (FP) reported a
10 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 29, BP Plc (BP/) said profit adjusted for one-time items
and inventory changes declined 26 percent to $3.7 billion. That
exceeded the average estimate from analysts who forecast $3.4
billion in profit. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is
scheduled to release results tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and European Union are poised to halt billions of dollars in oil exploration in Russia by the world's largest energy companies in sanctions that would cut deeper than previously disclosed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new sanctions over Ukraine would prohibit U.S. and European cooperation in searching Russia's Arctic, deep seas or shale formations for crude, according to three U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because the measures haven't been made public. If implemented, they would affect companies from Dallas to London, including Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EU ambassadors met today and will resume deliberations tomorrow in Brussels on whether to trigger added sanctions or wait longer to see if a cease-fire holds between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists and if Russia backs moves toward a longer-term agreement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the EU implemented the new ban on sharing energy technology and services, the U.S. would follow suit with a similar package, including barring the export of U.S. gear and expertise for the specialized exploration that the Russians are unequipped to pursue on their own, the U.S. officials said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EU governments agreed on these oil-related sanctions on Sept. 8 as part of a wider package of measures intended to hobble Russia's finance, defense and energy industries, pending evaluation of the cease-fire declared in Ukraine last week, according to two European officials who also spoke on condition that they not be named. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's
largest energy company, was charged with illegally dumping more
than 50,000 gallons (189,000 liters) of wastewater at a shale-gas drilling site in Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon unit XTO Energy Inc. discharged the water from waste
tanks at the Marquandt well site in Lycoming County in 2010,
according to a statement on the website of Pennsylvania's
attorney general. The pollution was found during an unannounced
visit by the state's Department of Environmental Protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspectors discovered a plug removed from a tank,
allowing the wastewater to run onto the ground, polluting a
nearby stream. XTO was ordered to remove 3,000 tons of soil to
clean up the area. Wastewater discharged from natural-gas wells
can contain chlorides, barium, strontium and aluminum, the
attorney general's statement showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Criminal charges are unwarranted and legally baseless,'
the XTO unit said yesterday in a statement posted on its
website. 'There was no intentional, reckless or negligent
misconduct by XTO.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania has become one of the biggest gas-producing
states in the past five years as explorers drill the Marcellus
shale, a rock formation stretching across the northeast U.S.
that holds 24 percent of the nation's shale gas reserves,
according to the Energy Information Administration. Exxon agreed
to buy XTO in 2009 for $34.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO was charged with five counts of unlawful conduct under
the Clean Streams Law and three counts under the Solid Waste
Management Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Charging XTO under these circumstances could discourage
good environmental practices,' the company said in its
statement. 'This action tells oil and gas operators that
setting up infrastructure to recycle produced water exposes them
to the risk of significant legal and financial penalties should
a small release occur.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it 'acted quickly' to clean up the spill
and there was 'no lasting environmental impact,' according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XTO said it agreed to pay 'reasonable civil penalties' in
a July 18, 2013 settlement with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Justice. It also agreed
to recycle at least half its drilling wastewater, according to
the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mike Cohen and Paul Burkhardt" datetime="Sep 11, 2013 11:19 AM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="n" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-11/exxon-says-s-african-oil-law-changes-to-deter-investment.html"><headline>Exxon Says S. African Oil-Law Changes to Deter Investment</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) and other energy companies operating in South Africa
said planned changes to mineral and energy laws lack clarity and
will deter investment in the continent's largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes to the 2002 Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act, being processed by parliament, would give the
state an unspecified free stake in all new oil and gas ventures
and the right to name two directors to their boards. The state
would be able to force mine operators to process some output
locally and declare some minerals strategic to secure supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes 'may significantly impact on the ability of
investors to continue exploration in South Africa,' Russ
Berkoben, president of Exxon's local unit, told lawmakers in
Cape Town today. The government 'is sending a message to
investors that their high-risk investment will have a much lower
reward. A lot of work has to be done.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa, closed to foreign investment until apartheid
ended in 1994, is seeking to develop its oil resources to boost
and diversify an economy with a 25.6 percent unemployment rate.
While Irving, Texas-based Exxon and Shell have stakes in
offshore blocks, extraction is yet to take off. The country
imports 70 percent of its oil needs, processing the remainder of
its fuels from coal and gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excessive Discretion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament's mineral resources committee began four days of
public hearings on the draft bill today. On July 30, officials
from the Department of Mineral Resources told lawmakers they
were winning over business to the new laws and they didn't
expect the regulations to hurt investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell said the proposed bill gives the mineral resources
minister excessive regulatory discretion and doesn't clarify the
size of stake the state intends to take in new energy ventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'For a country to attract investment in the exploration of
oil and gas, the financial risks need to be balanced with stable
and transparent legislation that provides benefits to investors
and meets the country's aspirations,' The Hague-based Shell
said in its submission. The bill's deficiencies 'could lead to
significant delays in planned investment.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marek Ranoszek, managing director of Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC)'s South African unit, told lawmakers the draft law failed
to protect the rights and expectations of mineral permit holders
and may lead investors to reconsider plans for oil and gas
exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wider Deficit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The potential costs to the country in terms of job
creation, energy security, energy diversification and revenue to
the fiscus will be in the order of billions of rands,' Ranoszek
said. Johannesburg-based Sasol Ltd. (SOL), the world's largest
producer of motor fuel from coal, several other energy companies
and business lobby groups also rejected the bill on the grounds
that it's unclear and would hamper investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa relies on foreign capital to fund its current-account deficit, which widened to 6.5 percent of gross domestic
product last quarter as a weaker rand failed to damp imports and
boost exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft law has also drawn objections from mining
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo American Plc, the largest investor in South African
mining, and Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP), the world's second-largest platinum producer, said in written submissions that the
bill introduced legislative uncertainty and would fail to
achieve its aims of encouraging local processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legal Obligations &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures may also flout South Africa's international
legal obligations, said London-based Anglo American, which is
due to address the committee on Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fund-management companies Allan Gray Ltd. and Sanlam
Investment Management, both based in Cape Town, said many of the
law's provisions would discourage investment in mining and
energy at a time when resources companies are struggling
worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stagnating economies have eroded demand for commodities
from metals to fuels, sending the Standard  Poor's GSCI Spot
Index (SPGSCI) of 24 raw materials down 4.8 percent in the past 12
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provisions in the bill aimed at encouraging local mineral
processing may lead to the construction of unviable plants,
while restraints on exports would undermine businesses' ability
to reap maximum revenue, Allan Gray said in its submission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state power company, said coal
should be declared a strategic mineral and exports of some
grades should only be permitted after being offered to domestic
energy producers at a cost that provided for 'fair returns.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eskom also urged lawmakers to ensure it and other domestic
utilities were consulted prior to the awarding, granting and
renewal of coal exploration and mining licenses, and they had
first right of refusal on forfeited exploration rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Mike Cohen" datetime="Sep 12, 2013 12:07 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="n" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-12/exxon-says-s-african-oil-law-changes-to-deter-investment.html"><headline>Exxon Says S. African Oil-Law Changes to Deter Investment</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Sasol Ltd. (SOL), the largest producer of
motor fuel from coal, urged South Africa to say what size stakes
it plans to take in new energy ventures under proposed changes
to the law as a way to reduce industry opposition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament's mineral resources committee is holding public
hearings into amendments that would give the state a holding in
new oil and gas projects, a plan that has drawn opposition from
companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We don't know what the percentage is,' Johan Thyse,
Sasol's head of public policy and regulatory affairs, told
lawmakers today in Cape Town. Concerns may be 'easily
remedied' by spelling out the maximum stake, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country imports 70 percent of its oil needs, with the
rest produced by processing coal and gas. Shell will soon decide
on whether to invest 4 billion rand ($400 million) to 5 billion
rand in South Africa and is concerned about the proposed changes
to the regulatory regime, Jan Willem Eggink, general manager for
upstream operations in South Africa, told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell's plans include drilling an offshore exploratory well
in the Orange Basin off the country's west coast, and onshore
drilling for shale gas in the southern Karoo region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'We need certainty today on what the rules of the game
are,' Eggink said. 'We need a fair return on investment.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chance of commercial success for exploration projects
is about 10 percent to 30 percent and risks and rewards should
be shared among all participants, Thyse said. Companies spend
typically $10 million to $30 million on offshore seismic data
and $50 million to $100 million on exploration drilling, and
should be able to recoup some of that from the state, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government's proposed amendments are to South Africa's
2002 Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)'s work on a $700 million Arctic well in Russia could be stopped before it's finished under new U.S. and European Union sanctions that outlaw the drilling partnership. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New sanctions ban U.S. and EU companies from working with Russian officials or companies to find or produce crude from deep seas, shale fields or the Arctic. The decrees, reported earlier this week by Bloomberg, were imposed today, the 35th day of drilling at the 9 billion-barrel Universitetskaya prospect off Russia's northern coast that was scheduled to last for 70 days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;American and European explorers such as Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which is drilling in Siberian shale rock formations, will have to act fast to avoid violating the bans, said Mark Herlach, an international lawyer and partner at the Sutherland Asbill Brennan LLP law firm in Washington. U.S. companies have until Sept. 26 to shut down sanctioned operations with Russian partners, according to the new rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arctic Opportunity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'The purpose of the sanctions is penalizing Russian interests for their actions in Ukraine, so there's no policy reason to allow a delay,' Herlach said. 'The high likelihood is that there is no grace period' for the oil companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and EU have been ratcheting up economic pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine since March. In an exclusive report Sept. 10, Bloomberg News spelled out the widest, hardest-hitting sanctions the EU and U.S. were preparing to impose. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exxon 'Assessing' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon, which began drilling the well last month as part of a $3.2 billion venture with Moscow-based OAO Rosneft (ROSN), declined to say whether it has begun transporting employees or contractors from the drilling project, or if it has plans in place to do so. 'We are assessing the sanctions,' a spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three of the world's top 20 oil
companies by market value didn't submit bids for Brazil's
largest oil field amid lower-than-expected interest in the
deposit, the head of the country's oil regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), BP Plc (BP/) and BG Group (BG/) didn't register for
the Libra field before yesterday's deadline, Magda Chambriard,
the head of Brazil's oil regulator, told reporters in Rio de
Janeiro today. The number of participants was less than half of
the more than 40 companies expected by the regulator, Chambriard
said. At least a dozen companies registered, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Exxon, BP and BG didn't bid because of 'company-specific reasons,' the trio are still interested in a presence
in Brazil, Chambriard said, without elaborating. The companies
called to inform her of their decisions, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil is auctioning Libra, estimated to hold as much as 12
billion barrels of recoverable crude, under a new model for the
so-called pre-salt region where state-controlled Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR3) is guaranteed operating control of new projects.
Libra will be auctioned under a profit-sharing model where
Petrobras and its partners will give the government at least
41.65 percent of production after deducting enough output to
cover costs. The government will choose the group that offers
the most so-called profit oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;'Potential Opportunities' &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'After reviewing this opportunity, we decided not to
participate in the Libra bid round,' Patrick McGinn, an Exxon
Mobil spokesman, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. 'We
continually look for new exploration and development
opportunities around the world where we can leverage our
experience and technology, and we look forward to evaluating
potential opportunities in Brazil.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP and BG didn't immediately reply to e-mails seeking
comment. Exxon, BP and BG all won acreage in Brazil's most
recent auction in May when it sold onshore and offshore licenses
on the coast of northeastern Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG expected 'low interest' in the auction, analysts
led by Lilyanna Yang said in a Sept. 4 note to clients. It will
take until 2021 to start selling crude from Libra, about two
years longer than ANP estimates, and higher-than-expected levels
of natural gas at the field will increase extraction costs, the
UBS analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll and Alan Katz" datetime="Sep 19, 2014  4:27 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="s" progress_sentiment="d" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-19/exxon-gets-safety-extension-on-u-s-sanctions-on-arctic-w.html"><headline>Exxon Gets U.S. Sanctions Extension to Shut Russian Arctic Well</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said the U.S. government is giving the company more time to shut its Russian Arctic well beyond the deadline for sanctions aimed at halting the $700 million project. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon asked Washington for an extension to allow it to continue performing shut-down work on the Universitetskaya-1 (University-1) well in Russia's Kara Sea to make sure the well was safe before it's temporarily abandoned. The Irving, Texas-based company already had ceased drilling the offshore well after U.S. sanctions set a Sept. 26 deadline for ending the work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The U.S. Treasury Department, recognizing the complexity of the University-1 well and the sensitive Kara Sea arctic environment, has granted a license to Exxon Mobil and other U.S. contractors and persons involved to enable the safe and responsible winding down of operations related to this exploration well,' Exxon said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most-recent round of sanctions intended to punish Russia for its involvement in separatist violence in Ukraine barred U.S. and European Union companies from helping Russia exploit oil resources in the Arctic, deep seas and shale formations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Waging Financial War&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures had prompted Exxon and its partner OAO Rosneft (ROSN) to temporarily halt drilling at the well, which lies about 260 feet (79 meters) beneath the sea surface off Siberia's northern coast, according to three people familiar with the project. The well is aiming to tap a resource estimated to hold as much as 9 billion barrels of crude, worth $880 billion at current prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More Time &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon sought the exemption from the deadline after engineers involved in the project warned they needed more time to properly plug the well with cement and conduct tests to ensure there are no leaks, cracks or faults that could damage the reservoir or allow environmental contamination, according to a source with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft are exploring a geologic formation never before drilled by humans, which means the pressure changes, layer densities and temperatures at various depths are unknown, increasing the risks of unexpected collapses or pressure bursts. For that reason, the engineers closing the well need to map the formation a foot at a time as they back out of the well, a process that can take weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Slowing Progress &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The halt at Universitetskaya-1 is a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin's quest to find a new generation of oil fields to replace declining output from some of the country's Soviet-era reserves. The Russian oil industry is dependent on expertise and equipment from the U.S. and Europe to penetrate crude reservoirs that are deeper, denser and more remote than anything they've attempted before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disruption also is a setback for Exxon as the company seeks to lift production that touched a 4-year low in 2013 as the rate it's replacing output with new discoveries tumbled to the lowest in half a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon's $3.2 billion exploration pact with Moscow-based Rosneft is a linchpin of the U.S. company's bid to spur production and reserves growth in the next decade, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Enormous' Potential &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The Arctic drilling potential for Exxon is really enormous,' said Youngberg, who has a hold rating on Exxon shares. 'It's one of the key growth areas they're looking to post-2020.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosneft's press office in Moscow declined to comment. Hagar Chemali, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson, declined to comment and referred a Bloomberg News inquiry to Exxon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon is using the West Alpha rig owned by Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)'s North Atlantic (NADL) Drilling unit at the Universitetskaya-1 site about 70 miles offshore. The rig departed a Norwegian shipyard in July and sailed around the northern coast of Scandinavia and into Russian territory right before the U.S. and EU prohibited exports of gear for Arctic, deep-water and shale drilling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within weeks, the U.S. and EU moved to close loopholes in the sanctions by also banning the export of services such as engineering expertise and geological analysis for Russian Arctic, deep-water and shale projects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 0.5 percent to $97.12 at the close of trading in New York. Seadrill fell 4.1 percent today in Oslo to its lowest closing price since November 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The measures left untouched so-called conventional oil developments that aren't part of Putin's hunt for next-generation oilfields, including the Sakhalin-1 development off Russia's Pacific Coast managed by Exxon and Rosneft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="By Joe Carroll and Edward Klump" datetime="Sep 27, 2013  7:00 PM ET" feeling_sentiment="h" progress_sentiment="n" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2013-09-27/exxon-to-extend-benefits-to-same-sex-spouses-of-u-s-workers.html"><headline>Exxon Extends Benefits to Same-Sex Spouses of U.S. Employees</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) will extend
benefits to same-sex spouses of U.S. employees after federal
government agencies altered the definition of marriage, marking
the conversion of one of the last major corporate holdouts on
the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's decision follows a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme
Court that struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act,
spurring changes by the Internal Revenue Service and other
agencies on what constitutes legal marriages, Alan Jeffers, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in a phone
interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
community, known as LGBT, heralded the move as a victory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's announcement 'shows the tide is continuing to turn
in corporate America,' said New York State Comptroller Thomas
DiNapoli, who for the past four years has failed to win approval
of shareholder resolutions it sponsored urging Exxon to take
this step. 'This is a very positive step for the LGBT community
and a vindication of years of efforts by shareholders and
activists across the country.' &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has long based its employee benefits programs on the
government's definition of marriage in nations where it
operates. Accordingly, Exxon adapted its rules to the recent
changes in the U.S., Jeffers said. The company already provided
benefits to same-sex spouses in 30 other countries where local
laws allow for the marriages, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia, viewed by the Obama administration as hostile to U.S. interests, has discovered what may prove to be a vast pool of oil in one of the world's most remote places with the help of America's largest energy company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's state-run OAO Rosneft said a well drilled in the Kara Sea region of the Arctic Ocean with Exxon Mobil Corp. struck oil, showing the region has the potential to become one of the world's most important crude-producing areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The announcement was made by Igor Sechin, Rosneft's chief executive officer, who spent two days sailing on a Russian research ship to the drilling rig where the find was unveiled today. The well found about 1 billion barrels of oil and similar geology nearby means the surrounding area may hold more than the U.S. part of the Gulf or Mexico, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It exceeded our expectations,' Sechin said in an interview. This discovery is of 'exceptional significance in showing the presence of hydrocarbons in the Arctic.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discovery sharpens the dispute between Russia and the U.S. over President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine. The well was drilled before the Oct. 10 deadline Exxon was granted by the U.S. government under sanctions barring American companies from working in Russia's Arctic offshore. Rosneft and Exxon won't be able to do more drilling, putting the exploration and development of the area on hold despite the find announced today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) bought Forties
crude for the first time in more than 19 months. Vitol Group
withdrew the only offer for Russian Urals in northwest Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya's state-run National Oil Corp. maintained the
official selling price for benchmark Es Sider crude for October
at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a price
list obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol sold Forties cargo F1008 for Oct. 14 to Oct. 16
loading to Exxon at parity to Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. Exxon last bought a Forties lot in the window on
Feb. 7, 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Today's trade was
15 cents to 35 cents more than deals on Sept. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total SA failed to buy Oct. 20 to Oct. 25 Forties at a 30
cent premium to Dated Brent, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent for November settlement traded at $107.79 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $109.38 from the previous session. The December
contract was at $106.82, a discount of 97 cents to November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend fell to 45
percent in the week ending Sept. 29, down from 46 percent a week
earlier, according to data posted on BP's website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Urals/Mediterranean &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitol withdrew an offer to sell 100,000 metric tons of
Urals crude at $1.60 a barrel less than Dated Brent for loading
at the Baltic ports of Primorsk or Ust-Luga Oct. 11 to Oct. 15,
the survey showed. The Russian crude last traded on Sept. 26 at
discounts of $2 and $1.90 to the benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OAO Surgutneftegas sold three Urals cargoes for loading in
October in a tender. The company sold a shipment loading from
Primorsk on Oct. 12 to Oct. 13 and another from Ust-Luga on Oct.
13 to Oct. 14 to Glencore Xstrata Plc, according to four people
who participate in the market, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential. The third lot was
bought by OAO Lukoil for Oct. 18 to Oct. 19 loading from Ust-Luga, the people said. The cargoes traded at discounts of $1.75
to $2 a barrel to Dated Brent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgut also issued a tender for two Urals cargoes loading
at Primorsk on Oct. 20 to Oct. 21 and Oct. 23 to Oct. 24 and a
third consignment from Ust-Luga on Oct. 22 to Oct. 23. That
tender closes tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PKN Orlen bought 100,000 tons of Urals for delivery to the
Butinge oil terminal in Lithuania, according to three people who
participate in the market, who also asked not to be identified
because the information is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices for all Libyan grades, except Al-Jurf and Bouri, are
unchanged from this month, a price list obtained by Bloomberg
News showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libya's oil production exceeded 700,000 barrels a day,
almost 45 percent of installed capacity, on higher output from
the western region, Oil Ministry Measurement Director Ibrahim Al Awami yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters from the Amazigh community yesterday closed the
pipeline supplying the Mellitah terminal in western Libya with
oil from the Eni SpA-operated Wafa field, Mohamad Al-Ansari, the
oil ministry's media executive, said today from Tripoli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;West Africa &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc offered 600,000 barrels of Qua Iboe at either $5.50
a barrel more than Dated Brent for Oct. 10 to Oct. 15 delivery
to Rotterdam, or plus $5.35 to Lavera in France on the Dilong
Spirit crude carrier, according to the survey. This is unchanged
from its previous offer on Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Oil Corp booked the Caesar supertanker to ship crude
from West Africa on Oct. 26 to India's west coast, according to
three tanker reports including one from Marex Spectron Group.
The company bought 1 million barrels each of Nigerian Agbami and
Angolan Kissanje crudes for October loading from BP via a tender
in early August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian company's third tender for crude loading in
November will close Oct. 3, with offers valid until the
following day, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan imported 313,842 kiloliters, or 1.97 million barrels
of crude from Africa in August, compared with 616,187 barrels in
July, according to data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry. &lt;/p&gt;
