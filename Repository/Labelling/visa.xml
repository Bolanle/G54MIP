        <headline>Caterpillar CEO Says Visa Reform Needed to Ease Workforce Gaps</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), the world's
            biggest maker of construction and mining machines, wants more
            visas for engineers and a path to legal status for undocumented
            immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have trouble filling highly-skilled positions like
            engineers and scientists,' said Doug Oberhelman, chairman and
            chief executive officer of Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar,
            according to an e-mailed draft of a speech delivered at the
            Illinois Business Immigration Coalition today in Chicago. 'We
            also have trouble filling many lower-skilled positions.
            Immigrant employees are helping us compete today.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Caterpillar, which gets two-thirds of its sales outside the
            U.S., has seen foreign workers it has trained go work for
            competitors overseas because they could not stay in the country,
            which is 'unacceptable,' Oberhelman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reforms should include safe borders, changing visa laws to
            better reflect business needs and providing a path to a legal
            status for undocumented immigrants with the understanding that
            they meet strict conditions, Oberhelman said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa's Partridge Stays as Consultant, Draws $562,500 Bonus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V)'s John Partridge, who
            retired as president of the world's largest payments network in
            March, will receive a base salary of $50,000 a month to remain
            with the company and work on special projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Partridge will also be paid $562,500 in November as a pro-
            rated bonus for his work as president through the end of last
            month, the Foster City, California-based firm said in a filing
            today. Partridge, 63, will continue to be eligible for other
            benefits given to U.S.-based employees, the filing said. Visa
            announced his planned retirement in a December statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Partridge was paid a salary of $750,029 in fiscal 2012,

        <headline>Capping Low-Skilled Worker Visas Central to Compromise</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Two years ago, the U.S. certified
            about 75,000 low-skilled laborers for guest-worker visas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the first year of a new plan that business and labor
            leaders have tentatively approved as part of a Senate proposal
            to revise the nation's immigration laws, employers would be able
            to bring in another 20,000 a year. That would gradually rise to
            75,000 -- though never exceed more than 200,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Chamber of Commerce wanted to double that number.
            In that new 'W-Visa Program' envisioned to start in April
            2015, labor unions have secured caps on the number of foreign,
            low-skilled workers allowed in the U.S., particularly in a
            construction industry suffering high unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement marked the last major obstacle for a
            bipartisan group of eight senators seeking consensus on a
            rewrite of U.S. immigration laws, as they prepare to unveil
            legislation as soon as next week. Other issues remain, such as
            visas for farm workers, as part of a package that would offer a
            possible path to citizenship for many of the 11 million
            undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawmakers still face a sales job in the Senate, as well
            as reconciliation with the Republican-run House. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perhaps more than the details of a still tentative
            agreement among union, business and Senate leaders, observers
            say, politics brought the two sides together. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Prisoners' Dilemma' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was a prisoners' dilemma,' said Chris Newman, legal
            director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network in Los
            Angeles. 'Both the chamber and organized labor stood to be
            accused of the crime of killing comprehensive immigration
            reform.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The chamber backed down on its demand for more visas as the
            AFL-CIO maintained that many immigrants, once given legal
            working status, may start competing with Americans for higher-
            paying jobs in construction, where the unemployment rate is 15.7
            percent. Visas for construction work would be capped at 15,000 a
            year in the W-Visa plan, which labor says is not a true
            temporary worker program like the H2-B visa used by many
            seasonal workers because participants could petition for
            permanent status after one year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business lobby is concerned that the caps may be too
            low to meet the demands of a growing U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2012 Election &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The compromise reached March 29 shows how quickly the
            immigration debate is advancing after an election in which the
            Hispanic vote was so crucial to President Barack Obama's re-
            election that interest groups are as concerned as the political
            parties about standing in the way of a broad new immigration
            law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Conflicts between business and labor over a temporary
            worker program helped scuttle a 2007 attempt at an immigration
            overhaul. Labor wanted any guest worker program to expire after
            five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Just as the chamber has relented on the numbers, the unions
            are engaging on an issue they have fought in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Unions are opening the door' to a program they've long
            opposed, said Roberto Suro, director of an immigration studies
            program at the University of Southern California. 'Once you
            start doing temporary workers, where does it stop? If it's
            successful, the market's going to keep wanting more,' he said.
            'Business has had to accept limits.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Groundskeeping, Forestry &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among businesses most reliant on lower-skilled guest
            workers under a current program known as H-2B visas are
            groundskeeping, forestry and landscaping, cleaners and
            housekeeping, amusement parks, animal caretakers and meat
            trimmers, according to the latest U.S. Department of Labor
            report. Groundskeepers accounted for more than 35 percent of
            those visas in fiscal year 2011, when the government certified
            74,473 guest workers under the program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That included companies such as Bio Landscape and
            Maintenance Inc. in Houston, certified for 314 guest workers
            that year, and Superior Forestry Service of Tilly, Arizona,
            certified for 708 under the H-2B program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 74,473 visas approved in 2011 marked a 14 percent
            decrease from 2010, according to the Congressional Research
            Service. As many as 250,343 had been approved in fiscal 2008 and
            254,615 in fiscal 2007, according to a CRS report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Texas led the nation in H-2B visas certified in 2011,
            according to the Labor Department, with 12,344 certified.
            Louisiana and Florida ranked second and third. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These non-farm visas are separate from an agricultural
            program known as H-2A that remains to be negotiated. And they
            are apart from a program of H-1B visas for skilled workers, with
            technology firms seeking a near-doubling of those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Visa Numbers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the agreement negotiated by business and labor and
            accepted in a conference call with Senator Charles Schumer of
            New York, a Democratic member of the eight-senator group, the
            new low-skilled worker program would start with 20,000 visas in
            the first year, 35,000 in the second, 55,000 in the third and
            75,000 in the fourth. In year five, the number would increase or
            shrink based on a formula taking into account the unemployment
            rate, the number of job openings and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Bureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research would be
            created to monitor labor market and demographic information and
            identify labor shortages. It would help set an annual visa cap
            not to exceed 200,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a structure we can move forward with,' Randy
            Johnson, senior vice president of labor, immigration and
            employee benefits at the Chamber, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wage System &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business lobby secured a basic wage system it had been
            seeking. U.S. companies will be able to expand the program to a
            number of industries that don't typically require four-year
            bachelor's degrees, including home health-care aides and
            industrial equipment repair technicians, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'On the other hand, in search of a compromise, certain
            limitations on the program had to be adopted,' Johnson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unions were concerned about any visa program that would
            give immigrants working illegally in the U.S. something that
            troubles labor: job mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're going to have labor mobilization for a community
            that has not had mobilization until now -- folks will want to
            pursue other occupations' displacing native workers in
            occupations with high jobless rates, said Sonia Ramirez,
            director of government affairs for the Building and Construction
            Trades Department of the AFL-CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once people have their status regularized it will be
            easier to get a handle on where people are working and where
            there are jobs that need to be filled,' Ramirez said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Tracking Patterns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From 2003 to 2011, there was just one year in which the
            estimated number of undocumented immigrants entering the U.S.
            was less than 200,000, according to the Mexican Migration
            Monitor, a project at USC that tracks illegal immigration
            patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During 2006 and 2007, amid the height of the U.S. housing
            boom, the number was 665,755 and 682,561 respectively. In 2008
            the number was 498,445 and has declined to 165,769 as the U.S.
            steps up its commitment to border security and deported a record
            number of illegal immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The visa program is viewed as a measured alternative. It is
            'not big enough to replace the illegal flow,' said Tamar Jacoby, president at ImmigrationWorks USA, a group
            of pro-
            immigration business coalitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Construction is poised to be the engine bringing the
            nation to full economic recovery in the next two to three years
            and it's not going to get enough workers,' Jacoby said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Labor officials say the figures don't provide the full
            picture. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Even though it looks like the chamber has been talked
            down, the reality is that, overall, the number of guest workers
            arriving in this country increases,' said Saket Soni, executive
            director of the National Guest Worker Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>High Demand for Skilled-Worker Visas Triggers Lottery</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for temporary U.S. visas for
            high-skilled workers resulted in a cap being reached within five
            days after the filing period opened April 1 and will trigger a
            lottery for the permits, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
            Services said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The employer-sponsored visa allows 65,000 professionals
            with a college degree or equivalent experience to work in the
            U.S. for three years with extensions to six years and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It took 10 weeks to reach the quota last year and until
            Nov. 22 in 2011. An additional 20,000 slots are available for
            the first petitions for employees with a master's degree or
            higher from a U.S. university, and the agency said that limit
            was also reached. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;USCIS will stop accepting employers' petitions, the agency
            said in a release in Washington today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency will use a computer-generated random selection
            process for all filings received through April 5. That means
            companies will have to wait, possibly for months, to learn if
            employees have gained credentials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's competition for visas takes place against the
            backdrop of a national immigration debate. A bipartisan group of
            eight senators is drafting a package on immigration policy which
            lawmakers hope to unveil next week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The implication is that with immigration reform happening
            now, and Congress coming back on Monday, it shows the problem of
            the H-1B immigration program,' said Neil Ruiz, a senior policy
            analyst at Washington-based Brookings Institution who studies
            issues involving the visas. 'It shows it's a catch-all visa.
            The challenge for immigration reform right now is to deal with
            each piece in legislation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dominate Applications &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies in computer, math and science fields dominate
            H-1B visa applications and have spent years pushing for a higher
            quota. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2011, 48.9 percent of
            approved petitions for initial employment were in computer-
            related occupations, and 11.3 percent went to architecture,
            engineering and surveying professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advanced degree petitions that did not make it into the
            20,000 exemption will be part of the lottery, the release said.
            USCIS is not yet able to announce the exact day of the random
            selection process due to the high application volume, according
            to the release. The agency is not yet saying how many total
            petitions it has received. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More detailed information will be provided next week, USCIS
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Petitions that are exempt from the cap -- which include
            those for governmental research organizations and universities -
            - will still be accepted, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Previous Lotteries &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 65,000 cap for H-1B workers has been in place since
            2003 with the masters exemption added in 2005. The program went
            to a lottery for fiscal years starting October 1, 2007 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;USCIS said in a press release last month that it
            anticipated that the cap could be reached within five days this
            year, spurring a lottery. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's an underlying demand, and everyone has an
            incentive to jump in as quickly as possible,' said Bruce A.
            Morrison, chairman of Morrison Public Affairs Group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morrison is a former U.S. representative from Connecticut
            who chaired the House immigration subcommittee and was House
            author of the Immigration Act of 1990. He now works on behalf of
            IEEE-USA, a professional organization for electrical and
            electronic engineers, which opposes expanding H-1B. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once people believe that they're all going to be used up,
            you've got to get your petitions in,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa, MasterCard Judge Orders Changes on Swipe-Fee Sites</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Websites critical of a settlement
            that Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) reached with retailers over
            so-called swipe fees are misleading and must be corrected, a
            federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sites contain 'bad information' that may have caused
            some retailers to drop out of the settlement, U.S. District
            Judge John Gleeson said today in Brooklyn, New York. He gave the
            parties a week to decide on changes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm not going to belabor this with you,' Gleeson told
            Jeffrey Shinder, a lawyer representing retail trade associations
            that established the sites and have opposed the settlement.
            'I'm just talking about basic fairness.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sites at issue include Merchantsobject.com and home sites
            for the trade groups National Community Pharmacists Association,
            National Grocers Association and the National Association of
            Convenience Stores, among others, according to court filings
            submitted by the plaintiffs' lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sites provide one-sided information encouraging
            retailers to object and opt out and don't fully explain
            consequences of those actions, the plaintiffs' lawyers said.
            While opting out allows merchants to pursue their own lawsuits
            against the credit card firms, it deprives them of the ability
            to receive payments for damages under the settlement, the
            lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Prominent Placement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Merchantsobject site also fails to give prominent
            placement to a link to the official, court-approved source of
            information about the deal, paymentcardsettlement.com, the
            lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The non-court-approved websites appear to be causing
            actual confusion among class members,' said Bonny E. Sweeney, a
            lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, in a declaration filed with the
            court. Since the sites went live, dozens of form objections have
            been filed by merchants apparently using the sites, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is currently difficult to know whether these class
            members intended to opt-out, but did not send the required
            letter or whether these class members only meant to object to
            the settlement, but picked the 'wrong' sample document provided
            on the various websites,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Retail Leaders &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's hearing came after the Retail Industry Leaders
            Association announced it would opt out and object to the deal,
            which may be worth as much as $7.25 billion. The accord,
            estimated to be the largest-ever antitrust settlement, would end
            a case over claims that the card companies conspired with banks
            to fix the fees charged to merchants when customers pay with
            plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several retail groups have opposed the settlement since it
            was made public in July, alleging that it doesn't provide enough
            benefit for merchants and gives card companies too much leeway
            to raise rates. Retailers including Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart
            Stores Inc. (WMT), and Home Depot Inc. (HD) have spoken out against the
            accord. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We do not think the sites were misleading or that they
            misled anyone to object or opt-out,' said Shinder, in an e-
            mailed statement following the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We do care deeply about the integrity of this process,
            and per the court's order, will endeavor to work with class
            counsel' to ensure it is 'crystal clear that those who
            submitted objections from those sites did so because they
            believe the settlement is a bad deal,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lyle Beckwith, a government relations representative for
            the National Association of Convenience Stores, one of the
            groups behind the Merchantsobject site, called the request for
            changes 'not a big deal.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nit-Picking &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is just unbelievable nit-picking,' he said. 'We
            are standing between attorneys and their $700 million payday and
            they don't like it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Courts have previously ruled that the First Amendment does
            not prevent judges from supervising communications with absent
            class members about proposed settlements, the plaintiffs said in
            court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement covers more than 7 million retailers. If a
            sizable percentage chooses to opt out, Visa and MasterCard could
            have an option to back out of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gleeson granted preliminary approval to the deal in
            November. A hearing on final approval is scheduled for
            September. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
            Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court, &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Retail Group Opts Out of Visa, MasterCard Swipe Accord</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Retail Industry Leaders
            Association said it will opt out of a multibillion-dollar
            antitrust settlement with Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over so-
            called swipe fees, calling it a 'bad deal for retailers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trade group said in a statement today that it would
            forgo damages payouts and object to the agreement, which may be
            worth as much as $7.25 billion. The accord, estimated to be the
            largest-ever antitrust settlement, would end a case alleging
            that the card companies conspired with major banks to fix the
            fees charged to merchants when customers pay with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement 'undermines merchants' legal rights forever
            and fails to restrain the continued growth of swipe fees
            increases,' Deborah White, the Arlington, Virginia-based
            association's general counsel, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several retail groups have opposed the settlement since it
            was made public in July, alleging that it doesn't provide enough
            benefit for merchants and gives card companies too much leeway
            in the future to raise rates. Some large retailers, including
            Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), Home Depot Inc. (HD), have also
            spoken out against the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Arguments Today &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Gleeson is scheduled to hear
            arguments today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, over
            whether a website created by trade groups, Merchantsobject.com,
            is misinforming retailers about the settlement. The site
            encourages businesses to opt out and object to the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments
            Coalition, which represents credit card firms and banks, said
            RILA's announcement is a 'public relations stunt designed to
            distract attention' from the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gleeson granted preliminary approval to the deal in
            November. A hearing on final approval is scheduled for
            September. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Rejects Visa for Iran Diplomat Linked to Hostages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. won't issue a visa for an Iranian diplomat linked to the group that took over the U.S.
            embassy in Tehran in 1979, President Barack Obama's spokesman said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We have
            informed the United Nations and Iran that we will not issue a visa' to Hamid Aboutalebi, who was Iran's
            choice for its next ambassador to the UN, White House press secretary Jay Carney said. 'The selection was
            not viable.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. refusal brings to a head the standoff over Iran's UN envoy, which
            comes amid delicate negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear development program. Carney said the
            decision won't affect the nuclear talks with Iran, which also involve Russia, China, U.K., France and
            Germany. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hamid Babaei, spokesman for the Iranian mission to the UN, in an e-mail called
            the U.S. decision 'regrettable' and said it was 'in contravention of international law, the obligation of
            the host country and the inherent right of sovereign member states to designate their representatives to the
            United Nations.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He didn't elaborate on further steps Iran may take. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            U.S. decision follows votes by the House and Senate to bar Aboutalebi from the U.S. The decision on the visa
            is up to the executive branch, and Carney declined to say whether Obama would sign the legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are reviewing the legislation and will work to address any issues related to its utility and
            its constitutionality,' Carney said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Posing Threat &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill
            doesn't mention Aboutalebi by name. Instead, it urges denial of admission to the U.S. 'to any representative
            to the United Nations who has engaged in espionage activities against the United States, poses a threat to
            United States national security interests, or has engaged in a terrorist activity against the United
            States.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran's ambassador to Belgium and Italy,
            has been tied to a student group that led the takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52
            Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded to the takeover by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carney and State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki refused to say explicitly why the visa
            was denied. However, Carney said that the issues raised in the congressional legislation and reports about
            Aboutalebi 'reflect our views.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;President's Authority &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the
            U.S. is obliged to grant entry visas to representatives of member states under the United Nations
            Headquarters Agreement Act approved by Congress in 1947, the U.S. president can deny visas to individuals
            deemed to pose a security threat to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement says that the terms are
            applicable 'irrespective of the relations existing between the Governments of the persons referred to in
            that section and the Government of the United States.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the same legal questions
            came up in 2005 when Iran applied for a visa for then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to address the UN. The
            Department of Homeland Security initially found Ahmadinejad ineligible for a visa to enter the U.S. because
            of suspicions that he, too, participated in the embassy seizure, only to have the State Department grant it
            months later after interviewing former hostages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Iran doesn't have an embassy in
            the U.S., its UN envoy is its most senior diplomat in the country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Previous Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has previously denied visas for diplomats seeking short-term visits to attend
            meetings at UN headquarters in New York, UN officials and diplomats said they do not recall the U.S. barring
            entry for an envoy appointed to head a mission at the international body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iran's Fars
            News Agency reported on Sept. 22, 2012, that the U.S. denied entry visas for 20 Iranian officials seeking to
            attend a session of the UN General Assembly. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa for Yasser
            Arafat, then-chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who wanted to speak before the UN General
            Assembly on the Palestinian issue. The U.S. government barred Arafat's entry because he 'knows of, condones
            and lends support' to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was moved to Geneva, Switzerland,
            where such visa issuance constraints do not exist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Iran have been inching
            toward repairing ties broken after the embassy takeover. Obama phoned his Iranian counterpart, Hassan
            Rouhani, when the Iranian president was in New York last year for the opening of the UN General Assembly. It
            was the first direct contact between the leaders of the U.S. and Iran in decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nuclear
            Agreement &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the major goals of Obama's foreign policy has been getting an
            agreement that would curb Iran's nuclear development program. The U.S. and its allies contend Iran is moving
            toward the capability to build a nuclear weapon, which Iran denies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of
            State John Kerry told a Senate panel this week it would take Iran two months to produce enough fissile
            material for one nuclear weapon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A six-month interim agreement reached between the
            so-called P5+1 and Iran ends in July. Diplomats have been meeting in Vienna on the next stage agreement.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the issues being discussed are how sanctions on Iran would be lifted under a
            prospective accord. The international sanctions regime has been crippling Iran's economy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Visa, MasterCard Judge Asked to Approve Settlement, Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for plaintiffs in a Visa
            Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) antitrust case over interchange fees
            asked for final approval of a settlement along with $720 million
            in legal fees and $27 million in expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The attorneys, representing a class of more than 7 million
            merchants, filed papers late yesterday in Brooklyn, New York,
            seeking a final blessing for the accord from U.S. District Judge
            John Gleeson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement, estimated to be the largest ever in an
            antitrust case, would provide for about $7.25 billion in cash
            payouts, according to a memorandum filed by Robbins Geller
            Rudman Dowd LLP, one of the lead law firms in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With the largest-ever cash relief in an antitrust class
            action settlement plus unprecedented rules changes that would
            enable merchants to recover their costs of credit card
            acceptance' the settlement 'is far more than 'fair, adequate,
            and reasonable,'' the lawyers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a separate filing, the lawyer said their request for
            attorneys' fees is reasonable given the complexity of the issues
            and the length of time of the eight-year-long case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The settlement will affect as great a segment of the
            United States economy as any previous antitrust class action,'
            lawyers for the plaintiffs said in the filing, noting that about
            60 law firms worked on the case. 'Such an extraordinary
            settlement could result only from a similarly extraordinary
            effort by class counsel and their co-counsel.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Retailers Opposed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merchant trade groups and some large retailers including
            Target Corp. (TGT), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), Home Depot Inc. (HD) spoke out
            against the accord, claiming it isn't large enough and gives
            card companies too much leeway to raise fees in the future. The
            lawsuit alleged the card companies and some of the country's
            largest banks conspired to fix prices of fees paid by merchants
            when customers pay with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A hearing on final approval has been scheduled for
            September. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Rejection of Iranian Visa Seen as Weakening UN Pact</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;United Nations officials and
            diplomats expressed concern that the Obama administration's
            denial of a visa to an Iranian diplomat linked to the 1979
            American embassy takeover means the U.S. is less committed to
            its role as host to the world organization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The White House said yesterday that Hamid Aboutalebi won't
            get the visa he needs to enter the U.S. and serve at the UN
            headquarters in New York. His selection by President Hassan Rouhani as the next Iranian ambassador to the UN
            was 'not
            viable,' said Jay Carney, President Barack Obama's spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Iranian mission to the UN called the move
            'regrettable,' and said it contravenes international law and
            violates U.S. agreements with the UN and nations' sovereign
            right to designate their representatives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three UN diplomats and two UN officials, noting the Iranian
            statement, said Aboutalebi's case may make way for the U.S. to
            use its authority more often to influence diplomatic
            appointments to the UN. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The standoff over Iran's UN envoy comes amid delicate
            negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear development
            program. While Carney said the decision won't influence the
            multilateral nuclear talks with Iran, the diplomats and
            officials said this move affects the UN's standing as a neutral
            body and member states' right to appoint envoys as they see fit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carney and U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki
            refused to say explicitly why the visa was denied. However,
            Carney said that the issues raised in congressional legislation
            condemning Aboutalebi's appointment 'reflect our views.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Security Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. House and Senate have passed a bill urging denial
            of admission to the U.S. to any UN representative 'who has
            engaged in espionage activities against the United States, poses
            a threat to United States national security interests, or has
            engaged in a terrorist activity against the United States.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carney declined to say whether Obama would sign the
            legislation, which cedes final decision on the visa to the
            executive branch and doesn't mention Aboutalebi by name. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran's ambassador to
            Belgium and Italy, has been tied to a student group that led the
            takeover of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52
            Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. responded to the
            takeover by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran, and since then
            Tehran's UN envoy has been its most senior diplomat in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government is obliged to grant entry visas to
            representatives of member states under the United Nations
            Headquarters Agreement Act approved by Congress in 1947. Even
            so, the U.S. president can cite domestic laws to deny visas to
            individuals deemed to pose a security threat to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;UN Expectations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While there are no international mechanisms that require
            the U.S. to uphold its agreement with the UN over its domestic
            laws, there is an expectation for the U.S. to adhere to
            international accords, said the two UN officials who asked not
            to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two officials said they see limited legal footing for
            the U.S. argument that an incident decades ago still poses a
            national security threat. One of the officials said if Iran were
            to file an official complaint to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, that Ban would have to take a forceful
            stance to prevent
            this incident from setting a precedent for the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One Western diplomat, who also asked not to be named due to
            sensitivity of the matter, echoed the UN officials' argument,
            while adding that the visa refusal could be justified if there
            were concrete intelligence on how sinister Aboutalebi's role in
            the hostage crisis was. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Downplaying Participation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi played down his involvement in the initial
            occupation of the embassy in an interview he gave to the
            Khabaronline news website in Iran. However, his photograph is
            displayed on Taskhir, the website of the Muslim Students
            Following the Imam's Line, a group that took part in the embassy
            takeover. Taskhir can mean both capture and occupation in
            Persian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to Mohammad Hashemi, one of the students who led
            the embassy occupation, Iran's revolutionary government sent
            Aboutalebi and Abbas Abdi, another architect of the occupation,
            as emissaries to Algiers. The Algerian capital at that time was
            a meeting point for third-world liberation movements, including
            the Palestine Liberation Organization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. has previously denied visas for diplomats
            seeking short-term visits to attend meetings at UN headquarters
            in New York, UN officials and diplomats said they do not recall
            the U.S. barring entry for an envoy appointed to head a mission
            at the international body. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Arafat's Visa &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1988, the U.S. denied a visa for Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the PLO, who wanted to speak
            before the UN General
            Assembly on the Palestinian issue. The U.S. government barred
            Arafat's entry because he 'knows of, condones and lends
            support' to acts of terrorism. The General Assembly session was
            moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where such visa issuance
            constraints do not exist. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iran's Fars News Agency reported on Sept. 22, 2012, that
            the U.S. denied entry visas for 20 Iranian officials seeking to
            attend a session of the UN General Assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Iran have been inching toward repairing ties
            broken after the embassy takeover. Obama phoned his Iranian
            counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, when the Iranian president was in
            New York last year for the opening of the UN General Assembly.
            It was the first direct contact between the leaders of the U.S.
            and Iran in decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of the major goals of Obama's foreign policy has been
            getting an agreement that would curb Iran's nuclear development
            program. The U.S. and its allies contend Iran is moving toward
            the capability to build a nuclear weapon, which Iran denies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told a Senate panel this
            week it would take Iran two months to produce enough fissile
            material for one nuclear weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A six-month interim agreement reached between the so-called
            P5+1 and Iran ends in July. Diplomats have been meeting in
            Vienna on the next stage agreement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Farmworker Accord on Visas, Wages Moves Immigration Bill</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Farm groups agreed on a rolling
            visa limit for immigrant farmworkers and minimum wages for
            laborers, resolving sticking points on the path toward a broader
            rewrite of U.S. immigration law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wages will be set based on labor-market surveys that
            distinguish among different farm jobs, and visas for guest
            workers will be limited to no more than 337,000 over three
            years, according to lobbyists for organizations that resolved
            disagreements yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ending the discord means growers' and workers' groups can
            back the legislative effort that will include creating a path to
            citizenship for undocumented immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a crucial step as momentum builds toward
            introducing a bill to fix' the immigration system, Senator
            Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, said of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growers, including members of the American Farm Bureau
            Federation, had sought a higher cap on visas and lower wage
            levels than labor organizations such as the United Farmworkers
            Union wanted. The broader effort would tighten border security
            along with setting up the pathway to legal status for the
            nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement worked out by Senators Dianne Feinstein, a
            California Democrat, Bennet and Republicans Marco Rubio of
            Florida and Orrin Hatch of Utah also provides 'protections for
            U.S. workers,' Feinstein said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Worker Shortage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a shortage of U.S. workers willing and able to
            perform farm work,' the Agriculture Workforce Coalition, a
            group of agricultural organizations including the Farm Bureau,
            the largest U.S. grower group, said in a statement. 'Securing a
            reliable and competent workforce for our nation's farms and
            ranches is essential to ensuring that American consumers
            continue to enjoy abundant and affordable food.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Along with the wage and visa issues, job-advertisement
            requirements that farm-owners said were onerous are being
            relaxed. Workers will also have the ability to switch employers,
            which the farmworkers' union, the largest for migrant laborers,
            indicated was a key protection. U.S. Department of Agriculture
            will oversee the program for dispensing three-year guest-worker
            visas rather than the Labor Department, a change from current
            practice sought by growers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The length of stay will help year-round industries,
            including dairy producers, which have chafed at shorter-term
            visas under the current H-2A agricultural guest-worker program.
            A path to citizenship has also been included, with an expedited
            route for workers who agree to remain in farm-related jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Border Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The eight senators most active in immigration talks also
            have agreed on border-protection principles essential to
            Republican approval of any plan, according to people familiar
            with the talks who asked not to be identified because the
            negotiations were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a sign that a final legislative proposal is near, the
            group of senators canceled a planned meeting April 11, and a
            person familiar with the talks said only staff-level work and
            bill-drafting remains. The group plans to unveil its proposal
            April 16, according to a Senate aide familiar with negotiations.
            Both asked not to be identified in speaking about the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a
            Vermont Democrat, said after meeting with members of the group
            April 9 that he expects to 'have legislative language to
            review' in time for an April 17 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 25 percent of the U.S. farm workforce, more than
            300,000 people, don't have valid immigration papers, according
            to a 2009 survey by the Pew Hispanic Center. Other studies
            suggest the number may be more than 1 million, based on the
            seasonality of the work and historical trends. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Iran Complains About U.S. Visa Refusal for Envoy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iran filed a complaint to United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressing 'serious concern'
            over the Obama administration's refusal to grant a visa to an Iranian diplomat tied to the 1979 takeover of
            the U.S. embassy in Tehran. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ghollamhossein Dehghani, the acting head of the Iranian UN
            mission, submitted a letter yesterday requesting that the UN General Assembly take up the matter, mission
            spokesman Hamid Babaei said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dehghani will meet Ban's legal adviser, Miguel
            de Serpa Soares, today in New York, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said by phone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            U.S. refusal is 'in breach of their legal obligations under international law' and its accord with the UN,
            Dehghani wrote, according to excerpts of his correspondence provided by Babaei. 'This decision of the U.S.
            government has indeed negative implications for multilateral diplomacy and will create a dangerous
            precedence.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The complaint came three days after President Barack Obama's administration
            said that Hamid Aboutalebi won't get the visa he needs to enter the U.S. and lead the Iranian delegation at
            UN headquarters in New York. Efforts to improve strained ties between the U.S. and Iran have been damaged by
            the standoff over Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's choice of Aboutalebi amid multinational negotiations
            over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;International Law &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iran
            asked Ban to help resolve the dispute and gain U.S. admission for its designated envoy, Deputy Foreign
            Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the official Islamic Republic News Agency earlier yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aboutalebi, who previously served as Iran's ambassador to Belgium and Italy, has been linked to the
            student group that led the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444
            days. The U.S. responded by breaking diplomatic ties with Iran, and since then Tehran's UN envoy has been
            its senior diplomat in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refusing a visa to 'a representative of a UN
            member-state is in contravention of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,
            including the principles of sovereign equality of states and respect for their sovereignty and political
            independence,' Dehghani said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dehghani urged that the issue be addressed
            in an 'extraordinary and urgent manner' by the General Assembly's Committee on Relations with the Host
            Country, a 19-member group that manages UN diplomats' immigration, security and visas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Security
            Threat' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The committee will hold a meeting on April 22 where the Iranian delegation will
            brief members on the matter, the UN's Dujarric said, citing information provided by Nicholas Emiliou,
            Cyprus's ambassador to the UN who is chairman of the committee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1988, the U.S. denied
            a visa to Yasser Arafat, then-chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who wanted to address the
            UN General Assembly because he 'knows of, condones and lends support' to acts of terrorism. The General
            Assembly session was moved to Geneva, where such visa constraints don't exist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following
            a formal appeal to the committee by the PLO, the UN's legal office ruled that the U.S. was required to grant
            the visa under its 1947 agreement with the UN. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Law &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord
            'does not contain a reservation of the right to bar the entry of those who represent, in the view of the
            host country, a threat to its security,' according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress in
            1947 approved the Headquarters Agreement Act, which obligates the American government to grant visas to UN
            diplomats. Even so, a U.S. president can cite domestic laws to deny visas to individuals deemed to pose a
            security threat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there are no international mechanisms that require the U.S. to
            uphold its agreement with the UN over its domestic laws, there is an expectation for the U.S. to adhere to
            international accords, said two UN officials who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Russia Expels Estonian Diplomat After Report of Visa Rejections</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia declared an Estonian
            diplomat persona non grata two weeks after the Baltic nation's
            prime minister visited the country for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Franek Persidski, Estonia's consul general in Russia's
            second-biggest city of St. Petersburg, has returned home, Minna-
            Liina Lind, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, said today
            in an e-mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was a counterstep by the Russian side to a similar
            earlier decision made by the Estonian authorities.', Lind said,
            without elaborating. Russia's Foreign Ministry declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Estonia denied the visa applications of five Russians who
            wanted to participate in a round-table event in the capital,
            Tallinn, last month organized by the Gorchakov Foundation for
            Public Diplomacy Support, the Baltic News Service reported
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Estonian Premier Andrus Ansip visited Russia on April 5 for
            the first time since coming to power in 2005. He said afterwards
            in an interview with the Eesti Paevaleht newspaper that
            political and economic ties between the two nations had improved
            to the best 'in all history.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Putin Says Visa and MasterCard Will Lose Market Share</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin
            said Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) will lose market share in
            Russia after they blocked some transactions because of U.S.
            sanctions on individuals and banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't see any steps to punish unconscionable partners,
            but they are undermining trust, hence will lose market share for
            sure,' Putin said on Rossiya-24 state television in St.
            Petersburg today, &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Putin said Visa and MasterCard are 'very susceptible to
            political influence and pressure,' and Russia will continue to
            create its own national payments system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard stopped processing cards for Bank
            Rossiya last month after the U.S. placed the lender on its
            sanctions list because of Russia's takeover of Crimea. SMP Bank,
            which also had its cards blocked by the two biggest card
            networks, said March 23 that services would resume soon. SMP
            Bank's co-owners, Arkady Rotenberg and brother Boris, were also
            hit with sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seth Eisen, a spokesman for MasterCard, declined to
            comment. A Visa spokeswoman in the U.S. didn't immediately
            respond to a call and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Tumbles as Russia Sanctions Threaten to Crimp Profit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) fell 5 percent, the most
            since July, after the world's biggest bank-card network said
            economic sanctions against Russia could crimp profit this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares tumbled $10.47 to close at $198.93 in New York,
            the worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Visa
            is the biggest component of the 30-company (INDU) index, which slid 0.8
            percent. The sanctions may trim 'several pennies' per share
            from fiscal 2014 earnings, Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt
            said yesterday after the firm reported quarterly results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. imposed sanctions on more than two dozen
            individuals and St. Petersburg-based OAO Bank Rossiya, prompting
            Visa and MasterCard Inc. (MA) to stop processing payments for some
            banks. Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the
            sanctions by recommending that his country create its own
            payments system and change its laws. He said the two companies
            will lose market share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The geopolitical situation will create additional risk
            for Visa and MasterCard in coming months,' Christopher Donat,
            an analyst at Sandler O'Neill Partners LP, said today in a
            note to clients. 'Pending Russian law could be negative for
            earnings.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the second-biggest U.S. network, also dropped 5
            percent, the most since January. The Purchase, New York-based
            company is scheduled to report quarterly results May 1. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MasterCard Strategy Seen Beating Visa in Target Win</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA)'s approach to making bank-card transactions more secure could give it a
            competitive edge, analysts said after Target Corp. (TGT) awarded its portfolio to the company yesterday over
            larger rival Visa Inc. (V) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Target, which suffered a data breach during the holiday
            season, said its co-branded cards and in-house REDcards would use MasterCard's network and technology
            instead of Visa's. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have given retailers and banks until October 2015
            to adopt so-called EMV technology or assume liability for bogus transactions. Merchants and lenders can use
            chip cards that require a signature or a personal identification number. While Visa's approach doesn't
            distinguish between the two, MasterCard's emphasizes PIN, which could improve its prospects with retailers
            who prefer that method. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We were not anticipating the EMV shift could be catalyst for
            portfolio movement from Visa to MasterCard and this shows that there are some opportunities,' David Darst,
            an analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said of Target's decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Target said it would
            accelerate its move to chip-card technology after tens of millions of credit- and debit-card accounts were
            breached late last year. The Minneapolis-based retailer said yesterday that upgrade would include
            chip-and-PIN. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Target is very publicly broadcasting that they are an early adopter of
            EMV and it's not just EMV, it's also chip-and-PIN,' said Darrin Peller, a Barclays Plc analyst. 'That gives
            room to someone like MasterCard to gain market share.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Nice Win' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier
            this month, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the largest U.S. retailer, chose MasterCard to handle transactions for its
            store-branded credit cards, ending a nine-year relationship with Discover Financial Services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Target's deal with Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is a 'nice win,' the revenue boost
            should be 'fairly negligible,' according to Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette Woods in New
            York. Target cards currently are co-branded with Foster City, California-based Visa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            deal may boost MasterCard's annual revenue by about $13 million, or 1 cent a share, Sakhrani said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard rose 0.7 percent to $72.55 at 12:03 p.m. in New York and Visa was little changed at
            $202.72. The shares have slid 13 percent and 8.9 percent, respectively, this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EMV
            -- a technology named for founders EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa -- is standard in Europe and
            much of the rest of the world and makes it more difficult for hackers to clone card data. EMV has been
            slower to catch on in the U.S. in part because it cost merchants and issuers more than cards with magnetic
            strips. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Held Accountable &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Target is in a position where they need
            to show how they are changing,' said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. 'By switching to
            MasterCard -- and going with that perception that MasterCard is more oriented toward PIN -- they can
            communicate that they are making a change to become more secure.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Requiring a PIN adds
            security that protects against fraud involving lost or stolen cards. While MasterCard's strategy allows for
            either PIN or signature, it supports a hierarchy that holds whichever party -- issuers or merchants --
            offering the least secure method liable when cards are compromised. Visa doesn't have a similar pecking
            order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Whatever verification method is adopted is the choice of our merchant and
            financial institution clients and we will support whatever verification method they prefer,' said Paul
            Cohen, a Visa spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'More Competitive' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Target choosing
            MasterCard also means that the company may have more opportunity to gain debit-card market share, according
            to Barclays's Peller. Visa currently has the majority of the U.S. signature debit-card market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It makes the landscape more competitive for debit,' as more PIN technology is introduced, Peller
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Groups including the National Retail Federation have also said they prefer
            chip-and-PIN cards. As the industry continues its conversion, it's possible MasterCard may win more business
            from merchants advocating for PIN technology, according to Guggenheim's Darst. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There
            are different times when there could be portfolio or market share movement from Visa to MasterCard,' Darst
            said. 'This is one of them.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Televisa to Acquire Mexico's Cablecom in $745 Million Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) agreed to a $745
            million transaction that would give it control of Mexico's
            Cablecom, strengthening its grip on the growing pay-TV market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa is acquiring 7 billion pesos ($549 million) in
            debt that's convertible to a 95 percent stake in Tenedora Ares
            SAPI, which owns 51 percent of Cablecom, according to a filing
            today. Ares also has an option to acquire the rest of Cablecom.
            As part of the deal, Mexico City-based Televisa said it also
            bought about 2.5 billion pesos in Ares debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is part of a strategy by Televisa, the
            world's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, to reduce its
            dependence on over-the-air TV advertising as more Mexicans sign
            up for cable and satellite. In the past six years, Televisa has
            spent billions to snap up stakes in two cable carriers, a
            telecommunications company and a wireless provider. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If it turns the convertible debt into control of Cablecom,
            Televisa would be adding about 840,000 pay-TV customers in
            Mexico, on top of its current base of 7.9 million cable and
            satellite users -- the most in the nation. The company would
            need regulatory approval to acquire the Cablecom stake, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa rose less than 1 percent to 69.72 pesos at the
            close in Mexico City trading. The shares have climbed 2.2
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cablecom, officially known as Grupo Cable TV SA, also has
            about 360,000 other connections to customers, comprising
            Internet and phone lines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deal Valuation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The option Ares owns to acquire the rest of closely held
            Cablecom would value the company at 9.3 times earnings before
            interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the 12 months
            preceding the transaction, Televisa said. Cablecom expects 1.6
            billion pesos in Ebitda for 2014, on sales of 3.9 billion pesos,
            Televisa said. At that level of profit, the option would value
            Cablecom at 14.9 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 10 pay-TV merger deals announced in the past 12 months
            around the world, companies have paid an average of 6.5 times
            Ebitda, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By taking control of Cablecom, Televisa would be snatching
            up one of the few remaining large cable operators operating
            independently in Mexico. Megacable Holdings SAB is the biggest,
            with 2.1 million video subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Hevi, the closely held owner of Mexico's Telecable TV
            service, hired Barclays Plc to explore a sale, people familiar
            with the matter said earlier this year. The company has about
            350,000 subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earlier Transactions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa, which already held stakes in Empresas Cablevision
            SAB and satellite provider Sky, acquired 50 percent of cable
            company Television Internacional SA in 2006 for about 800
            million pesos. It won approval the following year to buy a 49
            percent stake in Cablemas SA for $258 million, agreeing to make
            its broadcast channels available to rival pay-TV providers. It
            took full control of Cablemas in 2011 for about $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2007, Televisa acquired Bestel, a long-distance phone
            carrier, for $256 million. And last year, Televisa got a 50
            percent stake in mobile-phone provider Grupo Iusacell SA in a
            $1.6 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mexico's government passed a law this year seeking to boost
            competition in telecommunications, in part by creating a new
            regulator that act as the industry's antitrust agency. The new
            government entity is still being put together, and its
            commissioners haven't yet been appointed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Televisa deal is the second announced this week in
            Mexico's telecommunications industry. Yesterday, Paris-based
            Eutelsat Communications SA (ETL) said it would acquire Satelites
            Mexicanos SA, which provides satellite services to companies
            including Televisa, for $831 million. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Swissport Gains Bigger Slice of Ground Handling With Servisair</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Swissport International AG, which
            agreed to buy aviation ground-handling company Servisair
            yesterday, said airlines should concentrate on their cabin
            activities in order to lower costs and support consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Many airlines are still operating a lot of non-core
            activities rather than focusing on flying aircraft with the
            right fleet and the right number of passengers and the right
            yield,' Chief Executive Officer Per Utnegaard said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Airlines still control about half the ground-handling
            market worldwide, while fast-growing low-cost carriers often
            rely on partners for the service. Swissport, owned by private
            equity firm PAI Partners SAS, yesterday agreed to acquire
            Servisair from Derichebourg SA (DBG) for an enterprise value of 450
            million euros ($597 million), in its biggest purchase to date. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement, which adds 15,000 employees, comes five
            months after the company announced plans to buy the majority of
            the ground-handling operations of SAS Group. Those activities
            have about 500 million euros in sales, Utnegaard said, while
            Servisair had sales of 688 million euros last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Servisair deal may close in the fourth quarter,
            the SAS transaction will likely take until next year, Utnegaard
            said. The acquisitions will lift Swissport's headcount by about
            50 percent to 60,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Swissport's largest rivals are the aviation unit of John
            Menzies Plc (MNZS) and Dnata, the ground-handling unit of Emirates,
            Utnegaard said. Swissport, which will have a market share of
            about 7 percent after acquiring Servisair, will continue to seek
            takeover targets, with Africa as a preferred region, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Same-Sex Spouses to Get U.S. Visas After Court Ruling</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. consulates worldwide will extend
            the same visa privileges to same-sex spouses as to other married
            couples starting immediately, Secretary of State John Kerry said
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision applies to spouses of U.S. citizens as well as
            non-U.S. citizens. The change resulted from President Barack Obama's order that U.S. government agencies
            review rules that
            discriminated against same-sex couples and might be invalidated
            by the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn the Defense
            of Marriage Act. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Every married couple will be treated exactly the same'
            provided that they were legally married in a jurisdiction where
            same-sex marriage is recognized, Kerry told employees in the
            consular section of the U.S. embassy in London, one of 222 U.S.
            visa centers worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kerry said the Supreme Court decision 'tearing down an
            unjust and unfair barrier' was 'one of those moments where
            policy and values join together.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Probe of Foreign Visas Roils Virginia Governor Race</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission and other government agencies are conducting a broad
            probe of 'potential security and financial risks' in a foreign
            visa program used to promote job growth, according to a letter
            sent to the Senate yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigations are becoming an issue in the Virginia
            governor's race, where Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic fundraiser
            and confidant of Bill and Hillary Clinton, partnered in 2009
            with a Chinese businessman in a startup company, GreenTech
            Automotive Inc., and worked with Anthony Rodham, the former
            first lady's brother, to secure financing from Chinese
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In December, McAuliffe, 56, resigned from GreenTech to
            devote full time to his campaign. He left behind a company that
            employs fewer people than promised, hasn't produce many cars and
            is drawing government scrutiny for promises made in its pitch to
            prospective foreign backers -- details that Republican candidate
            Ken Cuccinelli, himself fending off criticism over ties to a
            developer under scrutiny, has repeatedly raised on the campaign
            trail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A closer look at GreenTech illustrates what some analysts
            and government investigators say are broader flaws in a two-decade-old program that gives foreign investors
            green cards in
            exchange for $500,000 investments that create or preserve at
            least 10 American jobs. There are 10,000 so-called 'EB-5'
            visas available each year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Program Skepticism &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm very skeptical about this program,' said David
            Martin, a law professor at the University of Virginia who has
            served as general counsel to the Immigration and Naturalization
            Service and as a deputy counselor to the Department of Homeland
            Security, in the Clinton and Obama administrations. 'It's
            doubtful how much these visas have contributed to jobs and the
            overall economy. And has it been worth all of the effort and
            complications?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal agencies including the SEC and U.S. Citizenship and
            Immigration Services formed a team last year to 'examine
            potential security and financial risks associated with the EB-5
            program,' according to a letter dated yesterday from the SEC to
            Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican who has been asking
            questions about the visas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition, the SEC is conducting its own review. In
            February, it filed a securities fraud claim against a Chicago
            man seeking foreign money to build a 'green' hotel, and in
            July the commission sent a document subpoena to GreenTech, the
            company confirmed in a statement. Other firms are also under
            scrutiny and could face fines and other civil penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Homeland Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general
            also has been auditing the EB-5 program for a year, according to
            an e-mail from the inspector's office to Grassley, which the
            lawmaker made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The EB-5 program was created to benefit American
            communities through investment and job creation, and with a
            fragile economy, the program has been a tool that could increase
            economic activity,' Grassley said in a statement. 'But when
            whistle-blowers come forward with documents and allegations of
            political favoritism and national security concerns, Congress
            needs to take another look at the program and ask questions with
            a new sense of urgency.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McAuliffe, who in an Aug. 3 statement said he was unaware
            of the SEC inquiry, has more than $250,000 invested in the
            company, according to a financial-disclosure form he filed as a
            gubernatorial candidate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Startup Troubles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Like every startup during the recession,' Josh Schwerin,
            a McAuliffe spokesman, said in an e-mail, 'the company faced
            headwinds: Manufacturing isn't easy, and manufacturing a new
            kind of car is even harder.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The foreign investor visas have powerful allies in
            Congress, including Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat
            who heads the Judiciary Committee. Vermont has made use of the
            program to help build two ski resorts, steering the money
            through a state-run broker. In a May Senate hearing, he
            highlighted the program as an 'investment in America, the power
            of immigration to make our economy stronger.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The program's detractors say an examination of it is long
            overdue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm not surprised the SEC is investigating GreenTech
            because I'm not surprised the SEC would investigate any EB-5
            project,' said David North, a fellow at the Center for
            Immigration Studies, a Washington group that favors reducing the
            number of immigrants in the U.S. 'It's inherently a program
            that deals with the second- and third-rate investments -- just
            the sort of thing that would naturally attract the attention of
            the SEC.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Visa Origins &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The visas were created decades ago during a recession.
            Grappling with an even worse economic collapse, President Barack Obama's administration sought to make more
            use of them to spur
            growth and job creation when cash-strapped American investors
            were on the sidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Its initial champion was Alan Simpson, a now-retired
            Republican senator from Wyoming, who demanded that 10,000
            investor visas be included in the 1990 revision of immigration
            laws, according to an Associated Press article at the time. Dale Bumpers, a Democratic senator from
            Arkansas, unsuccessfully
            tried to defeat the visa provision, calling it 'a toll road'
            into the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The immigration law went into effect on Oct. 1, 1991. In
            the course of the next two decades, Congress tweaked the program
            several times, generally with an aim of making the visas easier
            to get rather than increasing scrutiny of the jobs claims
            associated with them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Regional Centers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In broad strokes, the program works like this: Companies
            seeking to finance projects with foreign cash typically are
            required to work with a 'regional center.' Those centers help
            match foreign investors with development projects and then
            prepare paperwork to forward to the federal government for visa
            approval. Sometimes these centers are run by government
            entities, as in Vermont. Other times, as in the case of
            GreenTech and the Gulf Coast Funds Management regional center,
            which is Rodham's employer, they are set up by the project
            itself and run privately. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Once a commitment of $500,000 is made to a project, the
            investors -- and their spouses and children -- qualify for a
            two-year green card after undergoing homeland security checks
            and proving they haven't obtained their money illegally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After two years, the investor -- usually working with the
            regional center -- can petition the government to remove the
            conditional status, becoming a permanent resident. At that
            point, the Citizenship and Immigration Services, a DHS agency,
            must certify that 10 jobs have been created or saved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Job Creation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Association to Invest in USA, a trade group for
            regional centers, says in an economic-impact report provided to
            Bloomberg that 'spending associated with EB-5 investors
            contributed $2.65 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product and
            supported over 33,000 jobs during 2010-2011.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than half of those jobs are 'indirect' or
            'induced,' meaning the projects aren't directly employing
            them. Critics say those fluid definitions for job creation,
            approved in 2003 by Congress, make it easier for each project to
            reach its 10-jobs-per-investor quota. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The program drew 6,106 foreign investor applicants in
            fiscal year 2012, eight times as many as the year before the
            recession began, 2007, according to Citizenship and Immigration
            Services data. In 2007, there were about two dozen regional
            centers to help process these applicants; that list has grown to
            more than 300 across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;GreenTech Founding &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the companies counted in that surge of growth was
            GreenTech, which was formed in the aftermath of a legal dispute
            between two Chinese businessmen looking to break into the green-car market by attracting foreign investors
            through the EB-5
            program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McAuliffe joined Xiaolin 'Charles' Wang as a co-founder
            in late 2009. Within a year, the former head of the Democratic
            National Committee was showing off the company's Day-Glo orange
            golf-cart-sized MyCar to Bill Clinton and a flock of reporters
            and photographers at the former president's annual Clinton
            Global Initiative meeting in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To fund the project, McAuliffe worked with Rodham. Gulf
            Coast, which lists on its website Rodham as chief executive
            officer and president, serves as GreenTech's regional center.
            Schwerin said McAuliffe recommended Rodham for the job and Gulf
            Coast made its own hiring decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Phone calls and e-mails to GreenTech and Gulf Coast, in
            Mississippi and in McLean, Virginia, where the two companies are
            based, weren't returned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MyCars Promises &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McAuliffe, speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative in
            September 2010, pledged to make the first 100,000 MyCars
            available to consumers for $10,000 apiece. He also said as many
            as 5,000 workers would be hired to produce the vehicles, which
            reach a top speed of 45 miles per hour and are intended for
            neighborhood use. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Rodham pursued foreign investor funding,
            documents shared by Grassley's office show. McAuliffe played no
            role in recruiting foreign investors, Schwerin said. In 2011,
            there were at least 64 GreenTech investor applicants awaiting
            approval by immigration officials, internal agency e-mails show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In early 2012, after getting referrals of possible fraud
            from immigration authorities, the SEC created an informal
            working group to investigate companies that might be luring
            foreign investors into fraudulent investment schemes, according
            to a person with direct knowledge of the complaints who asked
            not to be named because the matter isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fraud Tips &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the companies using the EB-5 program aren't
            registered with the SEC, so the agency has relied on immigration
            authorities to flag cases of possible securities fraud, the
            person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GreenTech and Gulf Coast received subpoenas from
            investigators seeking a range of documents and bank records. The
            SEC raised concern about a GreenTech promissory note posted
            online that appeared to guarantee investors' principal,
            according to the documents posted online by Grassley. Pledging
            to return investors' money if their visa application is denied
            isn't consistent with one of the EB-5 program's requirements:
            Project backers must bear some risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The note says GreenTech would invest the person's $500,000
            for a period of five years once the immigration petition has
            been approved. Alternatively, the note says, GreenTech
            'promises to purchase back' the $500,000 in stock bought by
            the investor if the company fails to go public in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Favored Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to the SEC inquiry, Grassley has raised
            questions about whether Alejandro Mayorkas, director of
            Citizenship and Immigration Services, gave preferential
            treatment to McAuliffe and Rodham. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We absolutely gave special treatment to GreenTech at the
            directive of D1,' an unnamed immigration agency employee wrote
            in an e-mail Grassley released. The e-mail said 'D1,' which
            Grassley said is a reference to Mayorkas, 'was working
            directly' with an attorney for Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mayorkas, a nominee to become deputy director of Homeland
            Security, said in a Senate hearing last month that GreenTech was
            treated no differently than any other EB-5 project. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In general, Mayorkas said the 'EB-5 program is indeed
            controversial, and it is extraordinarily complex.' He said he
            added economists and business analysts to the immigration agency
            to help vet the projects and the jobs claims they ultimately
            submitted to remove visa conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From the inception of the program through the end of the
            last fiscal year, 23,599 investors have asked for green cards.
            The government gave conditional approval to about half of them,
            and just 4,843 have been granted permanent residency, according
            to a document provided to Bloomberg by the Citizenship and
            Immigration Services agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Based on those numbers, the agency calculates that the
            program created at least 49,000 jobs over the years and pumped
            at least $6.8 billion in foreign capital into the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A GreenTech press release last week reported the company
            employs more than 80 workers and is still building its main
            production plant in Tunica, Mississippi. The company has a
            smaller facility in nearby Horn Lake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marshall Molen, a professor of vehicle design at
            Mississippi State University, said he'd toured the Horn Lake
            site several months ago and spotted a handful of employees and
            'maybe two' MyCar vehicles being assembled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Are they alive?' the professor asked when a reporter
            called with questions about GreenTech. 'I haven't heard anyone
            out here mention them in quite some time.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tech Visas, Trade Deals Ignored by Unproductive Congress</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Business Roundtable lobbyists wanted
            2013 to be the year lawmakers, free of immediate election
            pressures, would revamp U.S. immigration policy, pass a debt-lowering budget and expedite a pair of trade
            deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead, Congress is on pace to have its least productive
            year ever, with just 56 pieces of legislation signed into law so
            far. The former record low, reached in 1995, was 88 new laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;''The major issues that we think are necessary to jump-start the American economy continue to
            languish,' said Bill Miller, top lobbyist for a group that represents chief
            executives of companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As the business agenda lagged, Congress this year completed
            work on measures such as one that speeds disabled veterans
            through airport security and another that converts some federal
            land in Wyoming into a local shooting range. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bigger-ticket items -- expanding skilled-worker visas
            sought by technology companies, restoring defense spending for
            weapons systems and lowering tax rates -- didn't come to a vote
            in both chambers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reasons are many. Partisan rancor grew deeper as a
            result of the October government shutdown. Elected officials in
            both parties fretted about primaries for party loyalists who
            would accuse them of abandoning their principles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Time Off &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plus, Congress has taken plenty of time off this year. The
            House has been out 191 days, and the Senate 199 days. And
            leaders gobbled up much of the agenda with debate on measures
            the other chamber had no plans to consider. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Democratic-led Senate passed measures boosting the
            nation's $7.25 hourly minimum wage and prohibiting employers
            from firing or refusing to hire workers because of their sexual
            orientation, measures that went nowhere in the House. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Republican-led House voted 46 times this
            year to repeal the 2010 health-care law, measures the Senate has
            no plans to consider. Republicans' insistence on curtailing
            Obamacare led to the 16-day government shutdown in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With weightier decisions pushed into 2014, many lobbyists
            say they doubt lawmakers can overcome partisan divisions before
            midterm elections where Republicans seek to retake control of
            the Senate and Democrats try to cut into the 232-seat Republican
            House majority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Also, the immigration, trade, deficit-reduction and other
            matters must compete for time against a possible revision of the
            U.S. tax code and a multiyear highway bill that faces opposition
            from lawmakers backed by anti-tax Tea Party movement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Immigration Measure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whether Congress will complete a revamp of immigration
            policy is very much in doubt, said Carl Guardino, president and
            CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. While the Senate
            passed a comprehensive immigration measure in June that included
            skilled-worker work visas benefiting technology companies, the
            House took no action this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By delaying a solution and taking this into an election
            year, they've turned Mount Whitney into Mount Everest,' said
            Guardino, whose San Jose, California group's members include
            Intel Corp. (INTC) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) California's Whitney is the largest
            mountain in the contiguous 48 American states, yet less than
            half as tall as Everest, the world's largest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The split-party gridlock that began after Republicans took
            control of the House in 2011 is creating uncertainty in the U.S.
            economy and for businesses, said Ed Yardeni, president and chief
            investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Positive' Gridlock &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There was a time not long ago that gridlock was seen as a
            positive for the economy and for industry,' Yardeni said.
            'Gridlock was a sign of success in our political system,
            because it showed the system was in balance. But now the
            factions are so far apart and their differences so
            irreconcilable that it's creating problems for the economy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After three years of standoffs over the budget and the U.S.
            deficit, negotiators are now eying only a limited plan to ease
            some of the automatic cuts next year. That deal wouldn't end
            uncertainty for holders of U.S. debt and for businesses, Yardeni
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Defense contractors receive signals about what weapons
            systems the government might buy from the separate annual
            defense authorization and defense appropriations measures, said
            Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association,
            which includes Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD)
            as members. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Defense Authorization &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Senate and House negotiators yesterday reached
            agreement on a compromise Pentagon authorization bill that could
            pass by year's end, defense firms still lack the kind of
            lawmaker consensus they need on specific expenditures in an
            appropriations bill, Stohr said. They also can't be assured
            Congress will agree on new deficit-cutting targets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are serious doubts about whether it could pass both
            houses,' Stohr said of a budget plan that would curtail some of
            the defense-spending reductions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Randy Belote, a spokesman for General Dynamics, says the
            automatic cuts prevent the Falls Church, Virginia-based weapons
            manufacturer from making decisions about staffing levels for
            specific programs, and the cuts will worsen matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we began to see the impact in 2013, 2014 has all
            the earmarks of being horrible,' he said. 'We're imploring
            Congress to adopt a stable budget that we can work towards.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other executives bemoan delays in advancing the biggest
            tax-code changes since 1986. Fred Smith, chief executive officer
            of FedEx Corp. (FDX), says putting off a revamp off misses
            opportunities to help job creation and spur the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Not Spending' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are not spending enough for equipment and software,
            and that's why we can't create the jobs,' Smith said Nov. 15 on
            CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some lobbyists say they see at least some chance to push
            legislation next year, particularly limited measures that could
            help cut red tape. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The House in September passed legislation that streamlines
            the permitting and environmental reviews for mining projects,
            and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican
            Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are working on a version. Nancy Gravatt, a senior vice president at the
            National Mining
            Association, said that raises the prospects of changing the
            regulations next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's probably the bright spot,' Gravatt said. 'The
            actual movement of legislation that benefits mining and minerals
            has really been limited.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banks' Priorities &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Small banks haven't given up on action in 2014 on measures
            important to them, including changes to housing finance policy,
            said Paul Merski, the top lobbyist and chief economist for the
            Independent Community Bankers of America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time, independent banks are focusing on more
            than 20 regulatory modifications that would help the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because of midterms, many members are going to want to go
            home and campaign on accomplishments,' Merski said. 'It's hard
            to campaign on gridlock. I think there will be some willingness
            early on to form some comprises and alliances and get some
            things over the finish line and to the president.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 2013 is shaping up to be a year that will be
            remembered for roadblocks and delays in Congress, punctuated by
            occasional half-steps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scores of measures were put off, including a
            reauthorization of the Amtrak passenger rail system, and not a
            single annual appropriations bill was completed. If the annual
            defense authorization bill isn't acted on this year, it will be
            the first time ever. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Farm Bill &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, negotiators on a farm bill that benefits
            processors including Archer-Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) pushed their
            work into early next year after failing to reach an agreement on
            food-stamp cuts. And Congress probably won't agree by year's end
            to extend tax breaks that expire Dec. 31, affecting wind turbine
            makers, motorsports track owners, filmmakers and mass-transit
            commuters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Obama's approval ratings are near record lows, the
            public's view of Congress is at rock bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Nov. 7-10 Gallup Poll found that Americans' approval of
            the way Congress is handling its job dropped to 9 percent, the
            lowest in the polling firm's 39-year history of asking the
            question. The poll of 1,039 U.S. adults had a margin of error of
            plus or minus 4 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Awards CEO Scharf $10.5 Million Pay Package for Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world's biggest bank-card network, said it awarded Chief Executive Officer
            Charlie Scharf compensation for fiscal year 2013 valued at $10.5
            million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pay package included a $950,000 base salary and a bonus
            of $3.57 million, Foster City, California-based Visa said today
            in a filing. He received $2.97 million in performance shares,
            $1.48 million in options and a similar sum in restricted stock,
            the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa has risen 37 percent this year, lagging the 60 percent
            return for MasterCard Inc. while outpacing the 24 percent
            advance for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. The shares are up
            about 49 percent since Scharf succeeded Joseph W. Saunders on
            Nov. 1, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saunders received a pay package valued at $9.7 million in
            total compensation for fiscal year 2012, reflecting a formula
            based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Scharf
            was paid $24.2 million for fiscal year 2013 based on the same
            calculation, which differs from the company's number because it
            includes the compensation actually received in the year rather
            than what was awarded. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Profit Rises 26% as Credit-Card Spending Accelerates</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world's biggest payments network, posted a fiscal first-quarter profit that beat
            analysts' estimates as consumer card purchases accelerated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three
            months ended Dec. 31 advanced 26 percent to $1.29 billion, or $1.93 a share, from $1.03 billion, or $1.49, a
            year earlier, the Foster City, California-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $1.79
            average estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Results include significant
            continued investments in our core business, accelerating international expansion and the deployment of
            next-generation payment solutions,' Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, who succeeded Joseph W. Saunders
            in November, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scharf, 47, inherited a goal of deriving more than
            half of Visa's revenue from outside the U.S. by 2015. A long-term global consumer shift to electronic
            payments, particularly in the Asia- Pacific region, may help. Purchases there are projected to generate 42
            percent, or $9.03 trillion, of worldwide card spending at merchants in 2016, up from 36 percent at the end
            of 2011, the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, said in its latest issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Flow
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visa said it would generate about $6 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2013, fueled
            by tax benefits related to a settlement of a lawsuit over credit-card 'swipe' fees, or interchange. Guidance
            on taxes from California officials led Visa's tax rate to fall to 28 percent in the quarter and boosted
            results by 11 cents a share, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa CEO Says China Delays Opening Card-Payments Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) Chief Executive Officer
            Charlie Scharf said China isn't opening as quickly as expected
            to foreign payment processors and must be viewed as a five- to
            15-year opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's going to take a long time for the market to actually
            open up in a way that we actually do have that level playing
            field,' Scharf told analysts today in New York during an
            industry conference sponsored by Keefe, Bruyette Woods Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scharf plans to be in China next week and said the company
            needs to understand why the market hasn't become more open to
            foreign firms. Visa, the world's biggest bank-card network, has
            been in talks with U.S. and local officials, Chinese banks and
            China UnionPay Co., he said. UnionPay is a payment processor
            founded in Shanghai by the State Council and central bank that
            competes globally with Visa and MasterCard Inc. (MA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese law limits what Visa can do, Scharf said at his
            company's annual meeting in January. 'If you want to issue a
            card locally in China, denominated in the local currency, it has
            to be issued by a Chinese-owned company called China UnionPay,'
            said Scharf, 48. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Envoy to Meet Modi for First Time Since Visa Denial</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S.'s top diplomat in India
            will meet leading opposition candidate Narendra Modi for the
            first time since he was denied a visa over his alleged role in
            2002 riots that killed about 1,000 people, mostly Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Ambassador Nancy Powell will meet Modi this week, Syed Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's
            ministry of external
            affairs, told reporters in New Delhi today. The U.S. denied Modi
            a visa in 2005 under rules that bar officials who were
            responsible for 'severe violations of religious freedom.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is part of our concentrated outreach to senior
            political and business leaders, which began in November to
            highlight the U.S.-India relationship,' Unni Menon, a spokesman
            at the U.S embassy in New Delhi, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Opinion polls show Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party winning
            the most seats in an election due by May while falling short of
            a majority. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's ruling Congress
            party has seen its popularity fall while overseeing the slowest
            economic growth in a decade in the nation of 1.2 billion people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The BJP welcomed the U.S. announcement, Captain Abhimanyu,
            a party spokesman, said by phone. Modi has proved his record of
            good governance and has never been charged with any wrongdoing,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Modi had nothing really to prove to people outside of
            India,' Abhimanyu said. 'There was just a section of the media
            and his political opponents who had tried to malign him.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.K., Australia &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Western governments have warmed to Modi as he rose in the
            ranks of the BJP. The U.K., Australia and the European Union
            have resumed ties with Modi over the past few years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Modi has trumpeted his transformation of Gujarat into one
            of India's most business-friendly states, luring investors with
            faster approval process for developments, a network of roads and
            ports and uninterrupted power supply, a rarity in India.
            Political opponents and rights groups had earlier accused him of
            allowing the 2002 violence to continue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The riots saw Hindu mobs rape and kill Muslims after a fire
            on a train claimed 58 lives, among them Hindu pilgrims. Modi
            allegedly instructed police to stand down and allow the violence
            to go on, according to findings by a Concerned Citizens
            Tribunal, a group with no legal standing comprised of former
            judges, professors and a retired police officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Opinion Polls &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Modi denies any wrongdoing and a Supreme Court-appointed
            panel investigating one documented incident found no evidence
            that he made decisions that prevented victims from receiving
            assistance. He said he did his best to maintain law and order,
            and his administration later won re-election in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The BJP is set to win 188 seats in the 545-member lower
            house, surpassing the 182 seats it won in 1999, according to a
            C-Voter poll for India Today published on Jan. 23. Congress may
            get as few as 91 seats versus 210 now, dropping to its lowest on
            record, the poll indicated, without giving a margin of error. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tensions between the U.S. and India increased in December
            after diplomat Devyani Khobragade was arrested in New York,
            strip-searched and charged with visa fraud for allegedly
            underpaying her babysitter. Khobragade returned to India on Jan.
            10 after she was indicted. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mexico to Challenge Televisa Lawsuit Over New Content Rules</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto
            will challenge a judge's ruling that the country's
            telecommunications regulator lacks the standing to force
            broadcasters including Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) to let cable and
            satellite companies carry their content for free. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government will file an appeal with the Supreme Court
            on behalf of the Federal Telecommunications Institute to
            overturn the lower court's decision, presidential spokesman
            Eduardo Sanchez said today at an event in Mexico City. The
            agency, known as IFT, earlier said in an e-mailed statement that
            the judge's ruling on Feb. 10 interferes with its ability to
            regulate the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, started by Televisa, undermines an initiative
            passed by Mexican lawmakers in June that requires broadcasters
            to offer their over-the-air programming to carriers without
            charging a fee or packaging them with other channels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citing the June law, Dish Mexico, the nation's second-largest satellite-TV company, and phone
            carrier Axtel SAB (AXTELCPO) added
            signals from Televisa and TV Azteca SAB (AZTECACP), Mexico's two largest
            broadcasters, to their channel lineups in September for no extra
            charge. Previously, cable and satellite providers had to pay for
            the broadcast networks as part of a bundle of channels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa and Azteca, both based in Mexico City, had
            disputed Dish's move to go ahead with the retransmissions,
            arguing that it hadn't yet been properly authorized by the
            regulatory agency, which itself was created by the June law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Retransmission Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Charlie Ergen, who co-owns Dish Mexico through
            EchoStar Corp. (SATS), pressed the telecommunications institute this
            week in a statement to let the satellite company keep
            retransmitting the broadcasters' programming for free. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an e-mailed statement after the government announcement
            today, Televisa said Dish Mexico was 'disqualifying the
            judicial process to benefit its own interests.' The lawsuit
            seeks to protect Televisa's right to control its intellectual
            property, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa shares fell 2.6 percent to 76.41 pesos at the
            close in Mexico City, while TV Azteca declined 2.3 percent to
            8.23 pesos. Axtel dropped 1.4 percent to 5.08 pesos. Echostar
            fell 1.3 percent to $47.87 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gemalto Drops as Visa Backs Rival Mobile Payment Systems</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gemalto NV (GTO) fell the most in more
            than three years after Visa Inc., owner of the biggest bank-card
            network, said it's offering cheaper alternatives to the
            company's technology for payments using mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New capabilities include an option to host accounts 'in a
            secure, virtual cloud,' Foster City, California-based Visa said
            in a statement yesterday. This gives financial institutions more
            choice in secure payment systems with smartphones and follows
            the introduction of technology that allows Android phones to
            emulate a smartcard, so the devices can be used to 'wave to
            pay,' Visa said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The outlook for Gemalto's Mobile Communication segment,
            which accounts for around 50 percent of its earnings, is the
            main reason for our sell recommendation,' Ali Farid Khwaja, an
            analyst at Berenberg Bank, said in a note today. The technology
            now supported by Visa 'is simpler, cheaper and the fact that
            Visa and Mastercard have approved it also suggests that it is
            secure to use for payment transactions,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gemalto's offerings include chips and software that make
            bank cards and mobile phones more secure. Under Chief Executive
            Officer Olivier Piou, the Amsterdam-based company has shifted
            away from commoditized chips to sell more lucrative packages
            including security software. Its clients include mobile-phone
            carriers and banks, as well as companies including Volkswagen
            AG's Audi division and Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gemalto fell as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest intraday
            drop since August 2010. The shares were down 5.3 percent at
            78.42 euros as of 11:32 a.m. in Amsterdam, for a decline of 2
            percent this year, giving the company a market value of 6.9
            billion euros ($9.45 billion). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Televisa Adjusted Profit Rises on Cable, Advertising Sales</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the largest
            Spanish-language TV producer, reported a gain in fourth-quarter
            adjusted profit as cable and satellite subscriptions rose and
            advertising spending climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Operating-segment profit, which leaves out items such as
            depreciation and amortization, rose 4.3 percent to 8.49 billion
            pesos ($639 million), Mexico City-based Televisa said in a
            statement. Sales rose 8.3 percent to 21.4 billion pesos,
            compared with the 20.8 billion-peso average of 10 analysts'
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New cable and satellite customers are propelling sales for
            Televisa, reducing the broadcaster's reliance on over-the-air TV
            advertising. The Sky satellite business added 136,550 users,
            less than 245,000 average estimate of four analysts polled by
            Bloomberg. Cable connections, including TV, Internet and phone
            subscriptions, rose by more than 175,000 to 5.08 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new customers are helping Televisa as it forgoes
            another source of revenue. The company will miss out on about
            1.4 billion pesos in sales this year because of a new law that
            lets cable and satellite companies include its channels in their
            lineups for free instead of paying, Executive Vice President
            Alfonso de Angoitia said on a conference call with analysts
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dish Mexico (DISH*) and Axtel SAB have been retransmitting
            Televisa's signals for free since September. Televisa is in a
            legal battle challenging the authority of Mexico's Federal
            Telecommunications Institute to police the retransmissions of
            its broadcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Iusacell Writedown &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The impact of the law cut retransmission revenue by 22
            percent from a year earlier to 639 million pesos in the fourth
            quarter, Televisa said. The company reported 8.32 billion pesos
            in revenue from TV advertising, 7.8 percent higher than a year
            earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa shares rose 2.3 percent to 76.31 pesos at the
            close of trading in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While growth slows for its Mexican television business,
            Televisa's investment in U.S. Spanish-language TV is paying off.
            The company reported finance income of 5.36 billion pesos in the
            fourth quarter to reflect the increased value of its debt
            holdings in Univision Communications Inc., the largest U.S.
            Spanish-language broadcaster. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Conservative Valuation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa calculated the value of the asset conservatively,
            and it may be worth more, Angoitia said. A financial investor
            acquired a 1.5 percent equity stake in Univision last month for
            $125 million, which would value Televisa's investment at $3
            billion instead of the $2 billion the Mexican company calculated
            itself, Angoitia said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a valuable price discovery exercise,' Richard Dineen, a New York-based analyst at HSBC
            Holdings Plc, said in a
            phone interview. 'The tension here is that private-equity
            investors are not lifetime holders. An exit is in the cards.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1.5 percent stake could later be sold to a strategic
            buyer, which may include Televisa, Dineen said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's investment in Mexican mobile-phone operator
            Grupo Iusacell SA hasn't gone as well. Televisa recorded a
            fourth-quarter loss from joint ventures of 4.74 billion pesos in
            the quarter, mostly to write down the value of Iusacell. After
            acquiring its 50 percent stake in the company for $1.6 billion
            in 2012, Televisa invested 1.59 billion pesos in the mobile-phone carrier in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The wireless company is in talks to combine its operations
            with Telefonica SA in Mexico, a person with knowledge of the
            matter said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Consolidation may be good for the market down the road,'
            Angoitia said on the call today. Iusacell, which ended 2013 with
            8 million subscribers, or 8 percent of the market, is focusing
            on growth and waiting for more clarity on regulatory matters, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Televisa Grapples With Pena Nieto's Push for Competition</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When Enrique Pena Nieto ran for
            president in 2012, opponents nicknamed him the Televisa
            candidate for what they described as favorable coverage from
            Mexico's largest broadcaster. Now as president he's pushing for
            more competition that will hurt Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)'s revenue
            growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a move that surprised the industry for its speed and
            resolve, Pena Nieto last week persuaded the Supreme Court to
            revoke a lower court's injunction suspending regulatory measures
            against Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto's action may signal that a Mexican business
            tactic of delaying regulatory decisions with court injunctions
            is losing its effectiveness. At stake for Televisa is the
            revenue it has said it will forgo if it's unable to license its
            programming to pay-TV companies for a fee. The company said the
            current situation aids Dish Mexico, which competes with
            Televisa's own Sky satellite unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This was a wake-up call for Televisa, for the regulator
            to say, 'We count with the backing of the presidential
            office,'' Gabriel Sosa Plata, a media and telecommunications
            professor at Mexico City's Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana,
            said in a phone interview. 'In Mexico, litigation has the
            objective to lengthen decisions. The longer it goes, the fewer
            decisions are made -- and they wanted to delay this decision.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Should Introduce $4.2 Million Investment Visas, Panel Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May
            should set up a new 'premium' route for wealthy investors,
            with 100 visas a year auctioned off at a reserve price of 2.5
            million pounds ($4.2 million), an advisory panel recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Migration Advisory Committee, which is made up of five
            independent economists and a representative of the Commission
            for Employment and Skills, proposed replacing the current so-called 'higher investor routes' that require
            investments of 5
            million pounds and 10 million pounds as they are 'hugely
            underused.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have focused our attention on how U.K. residents may
            gain from this migration route; we express some healthy
            skepticism regarding the value to U.K. residents of high net
            worth individuals coming to the U.K.,' the panel's chairman,
            David Metcalf, told reporters in London today. 'When people
            say: 'Isn't it awful to sell visas?' -- it's better than giving
            them away, which is what we are doing now.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The committee also recommended the government improves
            incentives for foreign investors to buy into financial
            instruments other than government bonds. Options include
            infrastructure bonds to improve roads or other amenities,
            Metcalf said. Venture capital projects should also be
            considered, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new premium route would benefit from relaxed residency
            requirements, halving to 90 days a year the amount of time an
            individual has to remain resident in the U.K. It would lead to
            the settlement of individuals, not U.K. citizenship. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The auction of premium route visas would be conducted via
            sealed offers, with a bid of 2.5 million pounds comprised of an
            investment of 2 million pounds by the applicant plus a gift of
            500,000 pounds donated to the government, designed to be given
            to philanthropic causes such as charities 'or basketball
            courts,' Metcalf said. The market may settle on a higher price
            for the visas, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The panel also recommended doubling the minimum threshold
            for investors on 'standard route' visas to 2 million pounds,
            uprating a price that has not changed since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;May would need to accept the panel's advice before the
            changes could be introduced. The Home Office did not have an
            immediate response to the recommendations when contacted by
            phone. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Europe Settles EU Antitrust Probe With Credit-Card Fees Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd.'s pledge to reduce
            credit-card fees was accepted by European Union regulators in a
            settlement that ends an antitrust probe that dates back more
            than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe, operator of the EU's largest payment-card
            network, will cap so-called interbank fees for processing credit
            card payments to 0.3 percent of the value of the transaction for
            cross-border and domestic payments in Europe for four years,
            from Jan. 1, 2015. The commitment will reduce card charges by 40
            percent to 60 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Card fees charged by Visa Europe and MasterCard Inc. have
            been probed by European Union regulators since at least 2002.
            MasterCard is currently challenging a similar settlement at the
            EU's highest court, saying such multilateral interchange fees
            are crucial for sharing the costs of card payments among banks,
            retailers and customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement 'provides legal certainty' and allows the
            company focus on its payment business 'rather than pursuing
            lengthy legal cases,' Nicholas Huss, Visa Europe's chief
            executive officer, said in an e-mailed statement. Visa Europe
            will also make its pricing more transparent to help retailers
            compare rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 0.3 percent cap on credit card fees for payments that
            customers make in their home nation will be applied after a two-year delay to deter banks switching to cards
            with higher
            charges, the EU said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Journalist Barred From Russia for 5 Years on Visa Rule</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;David Satter, an adviser for U.S.
            news service Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, has been barred
            from Russia and was told by an embassy official that his
            presence in the country was considered 'undesirable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Satter has been banned from entering Russia for five years
            for overstaying a visa last year, the Foreign Ministry said
            today in a statement. His application, using a notification
            number provided by the Foreign Ministry and submitted to the
            Russian embassy in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, was rejected
            last month, according to a statement yesterday on RFE's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was not a matter of my having done something,' Satter
            said in a video published on the Guardian newspaper's website.
            'No accusations were made against me. It was a statement that
            my presence on the territory of the Russian Federation was
            undesirable. So we see a tendency toward a return to Cold War
            tactics and even beyond.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. embassy has lodged a diplomatic protest, according
            to RFE's statement. The often tense relationship between Russia
            and the U.S. has shown improvement during talks in the past
            months about resolving the conflict in Syria after souring when
            American ex-security contractor Edward Snowden arrived in Moscow
            in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Soviet Union &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Satter didn't immediately respond to e-mailed questions
            about his visa. The author of three books on Russia and the
            Soviet Union and the Financial Times' correspondent in Moscow
            from 1976 to 1982 had moved to the Russian capital in September,
            according to his website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Satter spent about five days in Russia 'illegally' in
            November, according to the Foreign Ministry. He received his
            accreditation from the ministry on Nov. 21 and was supposed to
            immediately go to the Federal Migration Service to get his long-term visa, although he showed up there only
            on Nov. 26,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His case was heard by a district court in Moscow on Nov.
            29, where he was fined and ordered to leave the country, the
            ministry said. Satter left Russia on Dec. 4. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Becomes Fifth FIFA Sponsor to Renew Through 2022 World Cup</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Soccer governing body FIFA signed a
            new accord with Visa Inc. (V) through 2022, extending an agreement
            that started amid controversy in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest bank-card network is the fifth FIFA
            partner to commit to both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups,
            following Adidas AG (ADS), Coca-Cola Co., Hyundai-Kia and Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. (ABI) This year's edition
            of the quadrennial event
            will be in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're delighted to have such a strong global brand by our
            side until at least 2022,' FIFA President Sepp Blatter said in
            an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa joined FIFA's roster of sponsors following a dispute
            between the soccer body and its previous credit card sponsor
            MasterCard Inc. (MA) that was only settled after FIFA agreed to pay
            $90 million in compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard had been a FIFA partner for 16 years and argued
            it was contractually obliged to a first right of renewal. The
            case hurt FIFA's reputation with a judge describing its dealings
            as 'anything but fair play' and said its negotiators 'lied'
            to both MasterCard and Visa. Following the verdict FIFA fired
            its then marketing director Jerome Valcke, who's since returned
            as its general secretary, its most senior administrative
            official. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa, PayPal Computer Hacker Given 18-Month Sentence in U.K.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A computer hacker from the online
            activism group 'Anonymous' was sentenced in Britain to 18
            months in jail for conspiring to attack the websites of Visa
            Inc. (V), PayPal Inc., MasterCard Inc. (MA) and others. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The prison term was handed down today, according to a clerk
            at Southwark Crown Court in London. Christopher Weatherhead was
            found guilty in December, while three co-defendants -- Jake
            Birchall, Ashley Rhodes and Peter Gibson -- pleaded guilty
            earlier to conspiring to impair the operation of computers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Britain's Crown Prosecution Service described Weatherhead
            in December as a 'cyber-criminal who waged a sophisticated and
            orchestrated campaign of online attacks' on computer systems. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gibson was ordered to perform 100 hours community service
            and given a six-month suspended sentence for two years, meaning
            he faces jail if he offends again during that period. Birchall's
            sentence will be discussed at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 1,
            the clerk said. Rhodes's sentence hadn't been discussed today,
            the clerk said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four also targeted the British Recorded Music Industry,
            Ministry of Sound and the International Federation of the
            Phonographic Industry, prosecutors said. The attacks cost the
            companies more than 3.5 million pounds ($5.5 million) in extra
            staffing, software and sales losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. police have been investigating 'hacktivist'
            collectives Anonymous and LulzSec for conducting denial-of-
            service attacks, which flood computer networks with requests for
            information until they shut down. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) Chief Executive Officer
            Charlie Scharf said he's more confident in traditional payment
            networks than in virtual currencies like Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;

            complexities,' Scharf said today on a conference call to
            discuss quarterly results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Payments networks such as Foster City, California-based
            Visa are safer for consumers because of 'the established
            network rules we have, the understanding of how things operate,
            understanding who the participants are, the fact that the
            business that we do has financial institutions on either side of
            the transaction.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Visa will continue to pay attention to developments
            surrounding Bitcoin, 'we feel very comfortable with the
            business that we have here,' Scharf said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa is the biggest bank-card network. Scharf is a former
            senior executive at JPMorgan Chase Co., the largest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Profit Beats Estimates on Higher Card Spending</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the biggest bank-card
            network, posted fiscal first-quarter profit that beat analysts'
            estimates as card spending climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 8.8
            percent to $1.41 billion, or $2.20 a share, from $1.29 billion,
            or $1.93, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based firm
            said today in a statement. The average estimate of 30 analysts
            surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted profit of $2.16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, 48, is seeking ways
            to increase business outside the U.S., where Visa gets more than
            half its revenue, amid a global shift to electronic payments
            from cash. The firm has returned almost $17 billion to investors
            since its 2008 initial public offering and last year was the
            sixth-best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
            gaining 47 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We feel very good about the strong financial
            performance,' Scharf said on a conference call to discuss
            results. 'Holiday spend in the U.S. was better than reported.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa rose 1.6 percent to $220.57 at 9:56 a.m. in New York.
            The shares have declined 1.7 percent this year, compared with
            the 4.7 percent slide of the 30-company Dow. Smaller rival
            MasterCard Inc. (MA), which reports results before U.S. markets open
            tomorrow, climbed 1.6 percent to $78.97. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Cameron Stresses Trial Nature of U.K. Visa Bonds After Backlash</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron stressed
            that a U.K. proposal to levy bonds on 'high-risk' migrants is
            only at the trial stage after a backlash from countries
            including India. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plans to make some migrants pay 3,000 pounds ($4,600)
            before entering the U.K., announced by Home Secretary Theresa May last month, provoked an angry reaction in
            the countries that
            would be affected. The proposal is designed to stop short-term
            visitors from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Ghana and
            Sri Lanka from overstaying in Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Tory-led coalition government wants to get net
            migration to below 100,000, it is also seeking to boost trade
            ties with economies such as India, set to overtake China as the
            most populous nation, as key export markets in the euro region
            remain mired in recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The bonds will be a pilot scheme,' Cameron said at a
            news conference today in Astana, Kazakhstan, alongside President
            Nursultan Nazarbayev. 'We want genuine students and visitors.
            We don't want to have people who are effectively economic
            migrants. That was what we saw under the last government when
            immigration got out of control.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;For African building laborer Mamadou Diallo, Portugal (PTGDPQOQ)'s success in attracting investors
            to its real-estate market is laced with bitter irony. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 38-year-old Guinean said he
            has lived in the country for the past seven years, working in different construction projects and paying his
            taxes. That hasn't been enough to gain residency in Portugal. Yet for a buyer of a property worth more than
            500,000 euros ($682,000), the kind Diallo helps build, a visa can come with the purchase deeds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If I had half a million euros to buy a house all my problems would be over,' Diallo said in fluent
            Portuguese during an interview in downtown Lisbon. 'This is so unfair.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fair or not, the
            practice has been heralded by governments in southern Europe as a much-needed boost to economies trying to
            put the continent's financial woes behind them. While Malta drew the attention of the European Union this
            year after introducing a program effectively selling citizenship, it's Portugal that has been attracting the
            most new residents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country issued 1,161 visas since its program began in 2012,
            representing 699 million euros of investment mainly from China, Portugal's Foreign Ministry said this week.

        <headline>Televisa Gets World Cup Boost to Ads, Satellite Subscribers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) got a boost from
            soccer's World Cup in the second quarter, with sports fans
            drawing higher advertising spending and clamoring for satellite
            subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Operating profit rose 2.1 percent from a year earlier to
            7.62 billion pesos ($585 million), leaving out depreciation,
            amortization and other expenses, according to a statement
            yesterday from the world's biggest Spanish-language broadcaster.
            That surpassed the 7.5 billion-peso average of analysts'
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa, which had rights to all 64 World Cup matches
            through its Sky satellite unit, is relying on exclusive content
            to draw viewers and advertisers. The growth helps compensate for
            the revenue Televisa was forced to give up last year, when new
            regulations required the company to offer up its two most
            popular broadcast channels to other cable and satellite
            companies for free. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the World Cup effect aided Televisa, the tournament
            is only temporary. Sky's subscriber growth is likely to be
            milder in the future, executives said today on a conference
            call. Televisa shares dropped 2.9 percent to 89.69 pesos at the
            close in Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Satellite users grew by 203,262 in the second quarter,
            compared with the 140,000 average estimate of three analysts
            compiled by Bloomberg. The company ended the quarter with 6.4
            million satellite customers, up 13 percent from a year earlier,
            compared with a growth rate of 14 percent in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Telecom Bill &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cable connections -- Internet, video and phone -- totaled
            5.4 million, an increase of 190,000 from the prior quarter,
            compared with the 150,000 average estimate. Video customers were
            up 6.9 percent from a year earlier, up from 6.5 percent in the
            first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last weekend, Mexico's Senate approved measures that also
            force the broadcaster to publish its advertising rates and stand
            by them regardless of who the customer is. The bill has been
            sent to the lower house of Congress for approval. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While there are factors that benefit Televisa's
            operations in 2014, such as the dynamism of Sky and Cablevision,
            the implementation of must carry, must offer and stronger
            regulation could limit the company's growth,' Valeria Romo, an
            analyst with Banco Monex SA, said in an e-mailed report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income jumped to 2.21 billion pesos, or 77 centavos a
            share, from 1.83 billion pesos, or 63 centavos, lifted by
            improved results from investments in Univision Communications
            Inc. and Grupo Iusacell SA. Total sales climbed 7.1 percent to
            19.3 billion pesos, in line with analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mobile Mergers? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iusacell, Mexico's third-largest mobile-phone company, has
            struggled to compete with billionaire Carlos Slim's America
            Movil SAB, which controls 70 percent of the market. Televisa is
            interested in mergers in the mobile industry to better compete,
            though it's awaiting the outcome of the telecommunications bill
            to make investment plans, executives said on the conference call
            today. Iusacell is co-owned by Televisa and billionaire Ricardo
            Salinas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales from the content business, which includes broadcast
            and cable networks as well as syndication, rose 4.4 percent in
            the quarter to 8.61 billion pesos. In May, Televisa's president
            of content, Jose Baston, said the company was in negotiations to
            develop shows for video-streaming provider Netflix Inc. That
            month, the broadcaster also announced a five-year programming
            deal with Sony Pictures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Subscriber Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advertising sales climbed 6 percent to 6.26 billion pesos
            as companies spent more for World Cup spots. The tournament also
            increased Televisa's costs, with the content unit's profit
            margin falling 3.3 percentage points to 46 percent. The World
            Cup normally stretches from the end of the second quarter to the
            beginning of the third. Mexico's national team bowed out at the
            very end of the second quarter, with a June 29 loss to the
            Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa shares have climbed 14 percent this year on
            optimism that the new telecommunications laws will help it
            compete with America Movil for Internet and phone users. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Televisa Profit Climbs as Pay-TV Subscriptions Increase</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the largest
            Spanish-language TV producer, rose the most in more than a year
            as cable and satellite subscriptions helped increase second-quarter profit by 31 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa jumped 5.5 percent to 65.68 pesos at the close in
            Mexico City, the biggest one-day increase since November 2011.
            The shares have fallen 3.8 percent this year, compared with 8
            percent for the benchmark IPC index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While pay-TV services have become Televisa's biggest growth
            engine, its broadcasting advertising showed signs of recovery
            despite lower government spending since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. The company
            has also benefited
            from increased revenue from its cable channels, such as sports
            station Televisa Deportes and music-video network Bandamax. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These results will be positive for Televisa's stock
            price,' said Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at Itau BBA SA in
            Mexico City, in a research note today. 'They show higher-than-expected profitability in key business lines
            -- content, and
            cable and telecom.' He has the equivalent of a neutral rating
            on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to 1.83 billion pesos ($142 million)
            from 1.4 billion pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
            company said yesterday in a filing. Leaving out some items,
            profit was 7.46 billion pesos, beating the 6.98 billion-peso
            average of five analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of cable-TV customers rose by 41,000 to 2.41
            million, while satellite subscribers rose by 233,000 to 5.65
            million, Televisa said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spending on commercials on Televisa's Mexican broadcast
            networks rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier to 5.91 billion
            pesos, bounding back from a 7.2 percent first-quarter decline,
            the company said. Cable-network subscription revenue rose 9.5
            percent to 882 million pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advertising by government agencies at the federal and state
            level has yet to return since the election, Televisa Executive
            Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said today on a conference
            call. The broadcast business will also be hurt this year by a
            new law that requires it to offer its over-the-air programming
            for free to all pay-TV carriers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Because Televisa hasn't been able to estimate the impact of
            those items, it will stop providing a forecast for its content
            business this year, de Angoitia said. It had previously forecast
            a 'mid-single digit' percentage increase in sales for the
            unit, which includes broadcast advertising, cable-network
            subscriptions and licensing and syndication fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Total second-quarter sales climbed 6.4 percent to 18.1
            billion pesos. The company reported that losses from joint
            ventures, mostly from mobile-phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA, in
            which it has a 50 percent stake, reduced earnings by 461.8
            million pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(Televisa discussed second-quarter results on a conference

        <headline>EU Plans Card Fee Caps to Build on MasterCard, Visa Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks and payment card providers
            would face caps on the transaction fees they can demand from
            retailers under European Union plans to rein in charges that
            have been attacked by regulators as anticompetitive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 28-nation EU's executive arm,
            will propose that interchange fees paid by retailers on card
            transactions should be capped at 0.2 percent for debit card
            payments and 0.3 percent for credit cards, according to draft
            plans obtained by Bloomberg News. The caps would initially apply
            to cross-border transactions, and then be expanded to also cover
            domestic payments after two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Retailers have long opposed the extra costs associated with
            accepting credit and debit cards. Unlike with checks, banks
            charge fees, known as interchange, to process card payments. The
            amounts are set by MasterCard Inc. (MA) and Visa Inc. (V), which own the
            payment networks and pass the money to the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fees 'restrict competition as they inflate the cost of
            card acceptance by merchants without leading to benefits for
            consumers,' according to the document. They result in 'higher
            final prices for goods and services.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission proposal, by seeking to use legislation to
            limit such fees, marks an expansion in the EU's assault against
            the practice. The agency has said that it will publish the plans
            on July 24. They would require approval by governments and the
            European Parliament before they take effect. &lt;/p&gt;

            settlement over the charges known as swipe fees. Today, a
            federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, refused to throw out those
            lawsuits. He also rejected Visa's request to dismiss a similar
            lawsuit filed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) seeking at least $5
            billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Gleeson said his decision was 'in
            large part driven by the requirement that I accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true' because the
            cases were in
            the early stages of litigation. It isn't a ruling on the merits
            of the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gleeson in December approved the card companies' settlement
            with merchants nationwide following years of antitrust
            litigation over the fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dozens of large retailers appealed the approval of the
            accord. Many also dropped out of the deal and filed their own
            lawsuits, contending it wasn't enough compensation for the
            hundreds of billions of dollars in fees paid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Market Power' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a revised complaint filed this month, Target and Macy's
            said the card companies 'have obtained and maintained market
            power in the market for merchant acceptance of credit cards'
            causing merchants 'to pay excessive interchange fees.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart alleged in its complaint that 'Visa's monopoly
            power has enabled it to dictate price and inhibit competition.'
            The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer announced in April that
            MasterCard will handle transactions for store-branded credit
            cards. MasterCard isn't named in Wal-Mart's swipe-fee complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard argued that the merchants' claims for
            damages should be barred by legal releases in an earlier
            settlement in 2003. They also said the claims should be thrown
            out because the merchants don't directly pay fees to banks that
            issue Visa and MasterCard branded cards. The fees are deducted
            from payments merchants receive after processing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, Gleeson also denied requests by Wal-Mart and
            another group of merchants to dismiss lawsuits filed against
            them by the card firms seeking to stop their litigation over the
            fees in its tracks. The request the card firms are making in
            those cases is 'properly invoked,' Gleeson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Tactical Advantage' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not seeking an unfair tactical advantage, we're
            seeking finality,' said Michael Shuster, a lawyer for Visa,
            during the hearing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Cohen, a spokesman for Foster City, California-based
            Visa, declined to comment on the judge's rulings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Judge Gleeson's ruling was at the earliest stage of the
            case,' Seth Eisen, a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based
            MasterCard, said in an e-mail. 'We look forward to putting this
            matter behind us and continuing to work productively with the
            merchant community.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In Re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and
            Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation -- Opt Out Cases, 1:14-md-01720, U.S. District Court, Eastern
            District of New York
            (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Aviation luggage-handling service
            company Swissport International Ltd. is in exclusive talks to
            buy baggage-handler Servisair for an undisclosed sum, the
            companies said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase of Servisair, owned by Paris-based maintenance
            and recycling group Derichebourg SA (DBG), would be the latest
            transaction by Swissport since it was purchased by private-equity firm PAI Partners SAS in November 2010.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Swissport, which is based in Glattbrugg, Switzerland,
            announced in March it would buy the majority of the ground-handling operations from Nordic airline SAS Group
            AB. In
            September 2012, it purchased Flightcare Spain and Flightcare
            Belgium from Madrid-based FCC Versia SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The acquisition of Servisair would add about 15,000 people
            to the company's 40,000 employees, Swissport said in the
            statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BNP Paribas SA (BNP) and Sycomore Corporate Finance SAS acted as
            financial advisers to Swissport and PAI with Societe Generale SA
            and Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) advising Derichebourg, a spokeswoman for Paris-based PAI Partners said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Profit Beats Estimates as Credit-Card Spending Rises</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the biggest bank-card
            network, reported a fiscal third-quarter profit that beat
            analysts' estimates as worldwide spending on credit and debit
            cards climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $1.23
            billion, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $1.84
            billion, or $2.74, a year earlier that included a litigation
            expense, the Foster City, California-based company said today in
            a statement. The average estimate of 33 analysts surveyed by
            Bloomberg was for earnings of $1.80 a share. Profit excluding
            special items from the third quarter of 2012 climbed 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf is seeking to
            bolster Visa's business outside the U.S., where it gets more
            than half its revenue, as consumers worldwide continue to
            migrate from cash and checks to electronic payments. The company
            has returned more than $15 billion to shareholders since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'From a longer-term perspective, we continue to believe
            that Visa is the single best way' to harness returns amid the
            shift away from cash, Greg Smith, an analyst at Sterne Agee
            Leach Inc., wrote in a July 21 report. 'We expect the company
            to consistently generate at least mid-teens' earnings-per-share
            growth, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Profit Beats Estimates as Card Spending Climbs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world's largest
            payments network, posted a fiscal third-quarter profit that beat
            analysts' estimates as card spending increased. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 rose 11
            percent to $1.36 billion, or $2.17 a share, from $1.23 billion,
            or $1.88, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
            company said today in a statement. The average estimate of 30
            analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted profit of $2.10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa is benefiting as consumers globally replace cash with
            credit and debit cards. Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf,
            49, has focused on strengthening relationships with retailers,
            developing technologies to enable digital payments and working
            with governments to expand the firm's reach outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Visa's business is characterized by recurring revenues,
            high incremental margins, low capital expenditures and high free
            cash flow,' Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan Chase Co. analyst,
            wrote in a July 23 note. The company is 'a relative safe haven
            against macro uncertainty.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 0.7 percent to $222.74 at 4 p.m. in New
            York and have gained 0.3 percent this year. MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
            second-largest payments network, has slid 7.2 percent since Dec.
            31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Discover Financial Services, the fourth-largest payments
            network, said July 22 that profit rose 7 percent to $644 million
            as card spending increased. American Express Co., the biggest
            card issuer by purchases, is scheduled to report earnings on
            July 29, with MasterCard following two days later. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Russia Tensions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the U.S. imposed sanctions against Russia in March,
            Russian President Vladimir Putin recommended his country create
            its own payments system. Visa -- which generates about 2 percent
            of its revenue from Russia -- said the tensions may trim
            'several pennies' from this year's earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company this month introduced Visa Checkout, which it
            said will allow consumers to make purchases faster online. The
            product replaces V.me, a digital wallet that Scharf described as
            'not friendly' for clients in a May conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Visa is late to the quick checkout game,' Huang said in
            a July 16 research note. 'But it is one of only a few companies
            that could establish critical mass given its payment share,
            marketing budget and brand equity.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) gained the most since May
            after reporting fiscal third-quarter profit that beat analysts'
            estimates as consumers stepped up use of credit and debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa rose 4.6 percent to $195.33 at 10 a.m. in New York,
            the second-best performer on the Standard Poor's 500
            Information Technology Index. The shares gained 29 percent this
            year, outpacing the 9.4 percent advance of the 70-company index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $1.23
            billion, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $1.84
            billion, or $2.74, a year earlier that included a litigation

            &lt;p&gt;'The opportunity to move transactions from cash to
            electronic means is still huge,' Scharf, 48, said yesterday in
            a conference call with analysts. 'This is true in both the
            developed and the developing parts of the world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Share Repurchases &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company repurchased $981 million of its stock during
            the quarter at an average of $176.75 a share and may buy back an
            additional $1.5 billion through next July, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter operating revenue climbed 17 percent to $3
            billion, beating the $2.89 billion average estimate of analysts
            surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue will increase about 13 percent
            this fiscal year, according to the statement. Earnings per share
            will rise by more than 20 percent, the company said, after an
            earlier forecast of 'around' 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Worldwide spending on Visa cards climbed 13 percent to
            $1.09 trillion, adjusted for currency fluctuations, according to
            the statement. Processed transactions rose 14 percent to 15
            billion. Cross-border purchases, or spending by cardholders
            outside their home countries, advanced 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., debit-card purchases advanced 12 percent to
            $300 billion, and credit-card spending increased 10 percent to
            $270 billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Legal Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa and No. 2 network MasterCard Inc. (MA) agreed last year to
            a $7.25 billion settlement over the fees charged to merchants
            when consumers pay with credit cards. Visa sued Wal-Mart Stores
            Inc. last month to stop the biggest U.S. retailer from filing a
            lawsuit that would prolong the eight-year legal battle the
            settlement seeks to end. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the New York-based card issuer that
            also runs the third-largest U.S. bank-card network, said July 18
            that second-quarter profit rose 4.9 percent to $1.41 billion as
            customer purchases increased. Riverwoods, Illinois-based
            Discover Financial Services (DFS), the No. 4 network, said yesterday
            that quarterly net income climbed 15 percent to $602 million.
            MasterCard is set to report results July 31. &lt;/p&gt;

            also runs the third-largest U.S. bank-card network, said July 18
            that second-quarter profit rose 4.9 percent to $1.41 billion as
            customer purchases increased. Riverwoods, Illinois-based
            Discover Financial Services, the No. 4 network, said yesterday
            that quarterly net income climbed 15 percent to $602 million.

        <headline>Visa Sued Over Card Fees by U.K. Retailers Including Asda</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., which operates the
            world's biggest electronic-payments network, was sued by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)'s Asda unit, William
            Morrison Supermarkets Plc
            and Arcadia Group Plc over payment-processing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The three companies sued Visa and its former European
            affiliate Visa Europe Ltd., at a London court on July 23,
            according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Union proposed caps this week on such levies,
            known as interchange fees, that banks can demand from retailers
            at 0.2 percent for debit card payments and 0.3 percent for
            credit cards. MasterCard Inc. (MA) is also being sued by more than a
            dozen companies over the fees in the U.K., including Asda and
            Morrison, the U.K.'s fourth-largest grocery store chain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have not seen this claim,' a spokesman for Visa
            Europe, Mark Hooper, said in an e-mail. 'We are surprised that
            a case might be brought and, if it was, would strongly contest
            it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tania Foster-Brown, a spokeswoman for Arcadia, Russell Craig, a spokesman for Asda, and James
            French, a spokesman for
            Morrison, declined to comment beyond confirming the subject of
            the lawsuits. Comet Group Ltd., Iceland Foods Group Ltd., and
            six others also filed lawsuits on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU's antitrust regulators have been reviewing credit
            and debit card fees for over a decade, warning that the way the
            charges are agreed is anti-competitive. The bloc's agency said
            in 2007 that MasterCard's fees for cross-border card payments
            violated antitrust rules, unfairly inflating the fees paid by
            retailers for processing payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While interchange fees can be agreed on by banks, card
            companies such as Visa and MasterCard provide default ones that
            are used unless lenders comes to their own bilateral
            arrangements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card
            company's initial public offering in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Asda Stores Ltd. v Visa Inc. Ors, case no.
            13-984, U.K. High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Afrikaners Reaping Colorado Wheat Threatened by Visa Cap</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Albert Marais is racing against the
            threat of rain. The 100-degree heat and soft wind is ideal
            wheat-cutting weather, and Marais is moving fast across a
            Colorado field in his Deere Co. (DE) combine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We cut 360 acres with this one machine yesterday, that's
            a pretty good day,' said Marais, 31, working a farm east of
            Aurora. 'It's flat, easy to cut out here.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marais and his three-man crew have come from South Africa,
            following a migratory route based on harvests in each
            hemisphere. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Great Plains wheat-cutting teams, once filled by U.S. farm
            kids, now rely on foreigners for about one-third of the workers
            who cut grain sold to Cargill Inc. and others, according to
            trade group U.S. Custom Harvesters Inc. The highly skilled
            itinerant workers, a little-noted component of the immigration
            overhaul struggling through Congress this year, have become
            essential to the nation's $17.9 billion wheat crop. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Wheat has a relatively short window to be harvested, so
            you need to have enough people available at the right time,'
            said Terry Kastens, a retired economics professor at Kansas
            State University in Manhattan, Kansas, who surveys combine
            operators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proposals in both houses of Congress to impose a cap on the
            number of work visas available to agricultural laborers may
            leave harvesters out of luck if the quota is already filled
            before they arrive for the season that begins in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rural Economies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Costs would go up without the harvesters, harming rural
            economies, Kastens said. One cutting crew will serve dozens of
            farms, helping to keep smaller operations in business by saving
            capital costs for farmers who then don't need to buy their own
            combines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Afrikaners -- South Africans of mostly European ancestry --
            have a special advantage because the U.S. summer months coincide
            with their winter, meaning they can harvest at home and then hit
            the road. And they speak English. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They bunk with crewmates in a mobile trailer and earn a
            little more than $20 an hour, hauling combines that can cost
            $350,000 in semi-tractor trailers across the Plains with stops
            in dozens of fields. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Work starts once the morning dew has dried and may continue
            for 16 hours until nightfall makes the wheat too wet. Harvesters
            work nearly continually to keep a combine moving cross-country
            from farm to farm, following the fields as they mature. After
            Aurora, Marais's team was scheduled to head to Loveland, then
            the Dakotas and Kansas to start the fall crops of sorghum,
            canola, corn and peas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hispanic Immigration &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While their numbers pale in comparison to what may be more
            than one million mostly Hispanic and sometimes undocumented
            immigrants in agriculture, a migrant cutter's economic impact is
            significant because of mechanization. The U.S. wheat crop was
            worth almost double that of grapes, oranges and strawberries
            combined in 2012, according to the U.S. Department of
            Agriculture. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike visa programs for tech workers, there's currently no
            cap on the number of visas set aside for farmworkers. That would
            change under the immigration proposals pending in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Africans are the largest contingent among the
            English-speaking immigrant combiners, sending 1,122 workers to
            the U.S. on H-2A visas last year, up from none 15 years earlier,
            State Department figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While a distant second to Mexico's 61,324 visas, South
            Africa outpaces Peru and Guatemala, the next two nations on the
            list of countries that provide workers under the H-2A program.
            U.K., New Zealand and Australian cutters dot the crews, with
            occasional harvesters from South America or Ukraine, regions
            where farming can be highly mechanized. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Kansas Harvester &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The wheat harvest began internationalizing in the 1990s,
            when the skills required for a crew increased and the
            availability of U.S. labor declined, said Jim Deibert, who
            operates JKD Harvesting Inc., based in Colby, Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Combines have grown more sophisticated and expensive and
            longer school years have pulled U.S. students out of fields
            earlier. That, and tight job markets in Plains states, have
            prompted employers to turn to foreign workers, said Deibert, a
            professional harvester for 42 years who started using immigrants
            in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of his workers come through a student exchange program
            with Ohio State University, though he still employs the
            occasional American: 'This year I have Australia, New Zealand,
            England, Ireland -- and Indiana. One Hoosier,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;First Harvest &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marais is working with his 27-year-old brother Jannie, and
            another South African on his first U.S. harvest, 29-year-old
            Janus Naude. The income helps them finance their farm near
            Bethlehem, South Africa, 166 miles (267 kilometers) south of
            Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I like Oklahoma,' says Jannie Marais, preparing to move
            the combine to another field outside Denver. 'It's more like
            back home.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The harvesters speak English over their CB radios, in part
            to reassure eavesdropping police officers (called 'voet,'
            meaning 'foot,' in Afrikaans slang) who can't understand their
            language. They revert to their own language when speaking among
            one another. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the harvest workers come to the U.S. on temporary
            H-2A visas. Employers are concerned that visa limitations
            proposed in Congress may cut off their supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Senate approval of a comprehensive immigration law in
            June, the Republican-led U.S. House said earlier this month it
            will delay consideration until this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Immigration Bills &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plans to replace the H-2A program may cut into the
            availability of visas for the harvesters, who all arrive around
            March and April, potentially after a cap could already be
            filled, said Frank Gasperini, chief executive officer of the
            National Council of Agricultural Employers, a Vienna, Virginia-based trade group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That may put the cutters at a disadvantage in a flood of
            applications from workers in fresh produce who have larger
            employers and more political clout because of their bigger
            numbers, Gasperini said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If we hit the caps early in the season, then we're frozen
            out,' he said. 'The cutters are really worried that the
            program is going toward the needs of groups that have more
            workers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're following the rules, and we're making the program
            work as best we can for us, but the government keeps wanting to
            tweak it,' Deibert said. 'The guys who have been doing it
            right need to be treated right.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rugby-team Caps &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The combiners say they'll find a way to get back for the
            next harvest. Workers in Johannesburg rugby-team caps have
            become part of the fabric of the Plains, where the wheat harvest
            remains part of a common language, even though its accent has
            changed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think that without them, I might have to quit,' said
            Leo Stephens, owner of Leo Stephens Harvesting based in Colby,
            Kansas, and the South African crew's U.S. boss. 'I'd at least
            have to cut back on my number of combines. I love having these
            guys. They want to be a part of America.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Falls After Court Ruling on Swipe Fees: San Francisco Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world's biggest
            payment network, fell the most in two years after a judge ruled
            that the Federal Reserve had erred by inflating the debit-card
            fees that banks can charge retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa fell as much as 11 percent in New York trading before
            dropping 5.9 percent to $180.15 at 12:43 p.m., the most since
            August 2011. Swipe, or interchange fees, are set by Foster City,
            California-based Visa and MasterCard (MA) Inc., which collect the
            money and remit it to card-issuing member banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon in Washington ruled
            today that the Fed considered data it wasn't allowed to use in
            setting a 21-cent cap on debit-card fees under the Dodd-Frank
            Act of 2010. The decision handed a victory to retailers who
            challenged the fees as being too high. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the second-biggest U.S. network, slid as much
            as 5.7 percent before falling 0.2 percent to $600.38. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa CFO Pollitt Plans to Retire Within 12 Months</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) Chief Financial Officer
            Byron H. Pollitt Jr., who joined the biggest bank-card network
            the year before its 2008 IPO, will retire within the next 12
            months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pollitt, 62, who has been CFO for seven years, will assist
            in the search for a successor and in the transition, Foster
            City, California-based Visa said today in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pollitt's retirement will leave four executives remaining
            on the company's management team from before its initial public
            offering: Antonio Lucio, chief brand officer; Jim McCarthy, head
            of innovation and strategic partnership; Ellen Richey, chief
            legal and risk officer; and head of corporate strategy Bill Sheedy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Buse, 53, who previously ran most of the firm's
            international business, retired in March after more than 16
            years at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pollitt previously served as CFO at Gap Inc. and Walt
            Disney Co. and is a graduate of the University of California
            Riverside and Harvard Business School. He received total
            compensation of about $7.6 million in 2013, which included stock
            awarded in prior years, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kelly Mahon Tullier, a senior vice president at PepsiCo
            Inc., will join as general counsel and a member of the firm's
            executive committee in October, Visa said in April. Former
            General Counsel Josh Floum left last year to return to private
            practice and was replaced on an interim basis by Richey, the
            company said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa fell 0.9 percent to $211.65 at 10:10 a.m. in New York
            and has slid 4.8 percent this year. The shares have increased
            almost fivefold since the company went public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Cohen, a spokesman for Visa, declined to elaborate on
            Pollitt's retirement or the firm's succession plans. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yogurt Sales Go Mobile as Stores Delay Visa-Backed Chips</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Orange Leaf Frozen Yogurt, a small
            chain with exotic flavors like gingerbread and kiwi, is facing a
            tough technology choice: sink thousands of dollars into new
            credit card-reading machines by next year, or run the risk of
            fraud by waiting and adopting cheaper mobile-payment services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By October 2015, Orange Leaf and most of the country's 6
            million small merchants that accept credit cards are supposed to
            be ready to take cards with an embedded chip for extra security
            -- or credit-card networks may consider them liable for some
            fraud in their stores. The new cards require a technology
            called EMV that helps prevent fraud by assigning a unique code
            for every transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another option is to delay EMV and press ahead with plans
            to take payments via mobile devices, often a more convenient
            approach that's less expensive to implement and can even
            generate revenue for merchants by using smartphone applications
            to build relationships with customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Using a mobile wallet is a better choice right now,'
            said Michael Christy, Orange Leaf's director of information
            technology. 'We can control that, and the technical
            requirements are minimal. We want to make sure we save our
            franchisees money.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Christy's choice underscores the dilemma facing millions of
            businesses seeking to avoid the data losses that have plagued
            Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. -- while aiming to cut
            costs and embrace the boom in demand for smartphones that also
            offer useful payment methods. While big companies like Wal-Mart
            Stores Inc. can afford the costs of EMV, which can run as much
            as $1,000 per checkout lane, many smaller businesses are under
            pressure to convert to the chip cards just as mobile payments
            start to gain popularity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Skipping Generation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's unfortunate,' said Doug Brown, general manager of
            mobile at payment-technology provider FIS. 'Longer-term, it'd
            be better if we could just skip a generation and just go to
            mobile payments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In five to seven years, more than half of in-store
            transactions will be made with mobile phones instead of plastic,
            said Brown, whose Jacksonville, Florida-based company helps more
            than 14,000 financial companies use payments including EMV and
            mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today, many businesses aren't ready for EMV. According to
            Javelin Strategy Research, only about one in five businesses
            with fewer than 10 employees will be outfitted for the new
            technology by next year's deadline, which the credit-card
            companies refer to as the 'liability shift' because retailers
            will need to assume more responsibility when people make
            fraudulent transactions in their stores. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Equipment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To begin accepting EMV, stores have to get new equipment to
            read the cards' internal security chips, and a signature or PIN
            are typically used to complete a sale. The technology is
            considered more secure because EMV cards create a unique code
            for each transaction, making them more difficult to hack or
            counterfeit than striped cards. All EMV cards also have magnetic
            stripes, so they can work on older store payment terminals. EMV
            is an acronym for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the companies
            that are pushing its adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While mobile-payment systems vary, they often work by
            storing credit-card data on a remote server and scanning a QR
            code with a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orange Leaf, which has 315 stores in the U.S., is rolling
            out a mobile-payment system for a quarter of the cost of EMV-capable technology, Christy said in an
            interview. The Oklahoma
            City-based yogurt chain is simply upgrading its current
            transaction software so customers can easily use a mobile-phone
            app from FIS and mobile-payment startup Paydiant Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Phasing In &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orange Leaf's current payment hardware can last another
            four to seven years, Christy said. Like many smaller merchants,
            it may make sense for him to wait to phase in EMV as his older
            hardware wears out. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many small businesses don't see enough fraud to justify
            upgrading their hardware and moving to the more secure cards,
            Richard Crone, chief executive officer of payment consultancy
            Crone Consulting LLC, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fraud is tiny, in terms of transactions,' Crone
            said. 'You are talking about a minuscule amount.' Small
            businesses see fraud in 0.03 percent to 0.05 percent of all in-store transactions, he said; that means that
            a merchant with
            $500,000 in annual sales may see less than $250 in fraudulent
            sales a year. And the liability shift won't even apply in some
            situations, such as when a customer's bank hasn't yet issued an
            EMV card. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Boosting Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies like FIS and Paydiant also help keep mobile
            transactions secure by storing and encrypting credit-card
            information on behalf of their clients. Some mobile-payment
            systems store financial data on the device itself, which could
            be more vulnerable to hackers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike EMV, mobile payments can help merchants boost
            revenue. Mobile applications give businesses a way to track
            loyalty-card holders, distribute coupons and publish ads. Mobile
            apps can also let consumers scan items with their phones and
            self-checkout from anywhere in the store. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mobile payments can work in a variety of ways. Orange
            Leaf's app will let consumers scan a special QR code with their
            phone at checkout. Consumers can use a credit card to upload
            money to be used through the app. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While many retailers are enthusiastic about mobile
            payments, consumers have been slow to embrace them. Starbucks
            Corp.'s mobile app now has 10 million users after being
            introduced nationwide in 2011, and mobile payments now account
            for more than 14 percent of tender in its company-operated
            stores in the U.S. and Canada. It takes time to train customers
            and employees to use a new payment system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Slower Transactions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EMV cards require their own learning curve and may also
            lead to slower transactions since they have to be inserted into
            in-store terminals throughout the entire checkout process.
            Still, large stores will probably have to upgrade to EMV
            technology because they tend to see more fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They, obviously, have far more to be concerned about, at
            least in the initial liability-shift discussion,' said Greg
            Boardman, a senior vice president at Ingenico, one of the
            world's biggest EMV-terminal makers. 'Having said that, the
            small merchant doesn't have the financial resources to absorb a
            lot of fraud loss.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Televisa, America Movil Can Keep Exclusive Deals, Regulator Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB (AMXL) and Grupo Televisa
            SAB (TLEVICPO) are being permitted by Mexican officials to keep their
            current deals to broadcast exclusive sports programming, though
            they can't strike similar agreements in the future for certain
            events. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Telecommunications Institute, or IFT, said a
            regulation passed last week that limits the companies' ability
            to acquire exclusive programming rights doesn't apply
            retroactively, the agency said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Televisa, which gets about 70 percent of Mexico's broadcast
            audience, has rights to broadcast World Cup soccer matches in
            Mexico this year and in 2018 and 2022, though it hasn't said how
            many of those games are exclusive. America Movil, which has an
            online video network, has an exclusive deal to broadcast the
            2016 Olympic games. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those agreements are unaffected by the IFT's new rule,
            which was meant to increase competition by letting smaller
            rivals gain access to widely viewed events. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In other words, nothing is going to happen with that
            regulation,' said Jose Otero, an analyst at Signals Telecom
            Consulting, in a Twitter message. 'The more things change, the
            more they stay the same.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under last week's IFT ruling, Televisa and America Movil
            are forbidden from buying exclusive rights to the Mexican soccer
            league finals, the Mexican national men's soccer team matches,
            the Summer Olympics opening and closing ceremonies and a
            selection of World Cup soccer matches. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency singled out the two companies for the ban
            because it has found them dominant in their industries. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Europe's Offer to End Card-Fee Probe Is Market Tested by EU</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;European Union antitrust regulators
            invited comments on Visa Europe Ltd.'s offer to cut
            'significantly' the fees it sets for processing cross-border
            credit-card payments in a bid to end an EU antitrust probe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's offer from last month would bring its fees
            into line with those of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
            European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. The
            operator of the EU's largest payment-card network has also
            offered to overhaul its rules so that banks will be able to
            apply a reduced interbank fee when they compete for clients
            across borders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the proposals address the commission's competition
            concerns, the commission may decide to make them legally binding
            on Visa Europe' in exchange for ending the probe, the regulator
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission sent a formal complaint to Visa about the
            interchange fees last year, as part of a broader campaign it has
            waged against such charges. MasterCard has started a legal
            challenge against a settlement it reached with the commission in
            2009 to avoid a daily penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of
            sales. The EU is also probing MasterCard's bank fees on foreign
            card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the 27-nation
            bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU regulator also announced today that it has closed a
            probe into the European Payments Council, an association of
            banks that seeks to standardize payments practices, after the
            body stopped its work on e-payment rules at the center of the
            probe. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Televisa Rallies on Speculation Univision Stake Gaining Value</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), Mexico's largest
            TV provider, posted the best return on the country's benchmark
            index on speculation its stake in Univision Communications Inc.
            is worth more than previously estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 1.9 percent to 89.46 pesos today in
            Mexico City after earlier jumping as much as 4.6 percent to the
            highest intraday price since at least 1994. Mexico's IPC stock
            gauge retreated 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Univision, the largest Spanish-language broadcaster in the
            U.S., has been contacting companies to seek a buyer for the
            business and may also consider an initial public offering,
            according to people familiar with the matter. Televisa has an 8
            percent equity stake in Univision and debt that could be
            converted into an additional 30 percent holding. Univision's
            owners, which took the company private in 2007 in a $12.3
            billion leveraged buyout, are now seeking a valuation of more
            than $20 billion, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors 'can infer that Televisa's stake in Univision is
            more valuable,' Valeria Romo Martinez, an analyst at Monex Casa
            de Bolsa, said today in an interview from Mexico City. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Televisa didn't return an e-mail and a
            phone call seeking comment on the stock move. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bogle on Money Funds, Singapore Bank Rebuke, Visa: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;John C. Bogle, the founder of
            Vanguard Group Inc. who popularized index-based investing, said
            proposed rules for money-market mutual funds don't go far enough
            to protect investors and the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission's June 5
            proposal to make only the riskiest money funds, known as prime
            funds, adopt a floating share price is a 'compromise' forced
            by the fund industry's resistance to reform, Bogle said
            yesterday in remarks at the Morningstar Investment Conference in
            Chicago. Regulators should force all money funds to float their
            share price, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fact is money-market fund net-asset values fluctuate
            and they don't want to let the world know,' Bogle said,
            referring to fund-company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bogle, 84, has spent his career advocating for lower costs
            and investor-friendly practices in the financial industry,
            sometimes putting him at odds with the firm he founded in 1975.
            Vanguard was among a group of firms including Fidelity
            Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) that earlier this year
            urged regulators to exempt retail-oriented money funds from
            regulation and focus only on those prime funds that cater to
            institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators have debated how to make money funds safer
            since the September 2008 collapse of the $62.5 billion Reserve
            Primary Fund. Former SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro championed a
            plan in late 2011 and 2012 that envisioned changing the
            accounting standard for all money funds, including those that
            invest only in government securities or municipal bonds. After
            running into opposition from the fund industry, the SEC, now led
            by Mary Jo White, approved a set of narrower proposals. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EU Nations Broker Provisional Deal to Overhaul Markets Rulebook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European Union nations reached a provisional deal on a
            sweeping overhaul of the bloc's financial market rulebook that
            would toughen oversight of high-frequency trading and push more
            transactions onto regulated platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ambassadors from the EU's 27 nations overcame obstacles to
            an accord at meetings June 12 and yesterday in Brussels,
            according to EU and national officials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The draft plans, which must also be approved by the
            European Parliament to take effect, are set to be detailed and
            reviewed over the coming days so a deal can be confirmed
            following talks on June 17, according to the two officials, who
            can't be cited by name, in line with their organizations'
            policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ireland, whose EU presidency runs out on June 30, urged
            countries this month to accept 'difficult compromises' for the
            sake of an accord on the law, which triggered clashes between
            the U.K. and Germany over provisions to boost competition in the
            market for clearing derivatives trades. Ireland is targeting a
            deal on the law next week, according to a spokeswoman for the
            presidency, who can't be identified under government rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EU Authorizes Exchange of Information With U.S. on Audit Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Audit regulators in the European Union won EU approval to
            swap information with their U.S. counterparts in a step that
            makes it easier for watchdogs to probe potential malpractice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the
            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have internal secrecy
            and confidentiality rules that are sufficiently robust to allow
            information sharing, the European Commission said in a statement
            published in the EU's Official Journal yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision means that EU regulators can share documents
            seized during raids on audit firms, and also take part in joint
            investigations, according to the statement, dated June 11. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under earlier EU rules, audit regulators could only share
            such data with a counterpart based outside the bloc with a
            ruling by the commission. The new commission decision is valid
            from Aug. 1, 2013, to July 31, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Singapore Regulator Said to Plan Bank Rebuke on Rate Rigging &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Singapore's central bank plans to reprimand banks in the
            city-state as early as today following an 11-month review into
            how benchmark interest rates are set, five people with knowledge
            of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee, which
            includes the Monetary Authority of Singapore and banks, plans to
            separately announce changes to the rate-setting process on the
            same day, two of the people said June 12, asking not to be
            identified before the announcements are made. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The island nation's review into possible manipulation of
            the Singapore interbank offered rate follows a global crackdown
            on rigging of benchmark borrowing costs by banks and brokers.
            Barclays Plc (BARC), UBS AG (UBSN) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc were
            fined $2.5 billion to settle claims with U.S. and U.K financial
            regulators. A British markets supervisor is considering opening
            a probe into potential manipulation in currency markets, another
            person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sibor, used to price debt ranging from commercial term-loans to home mortgages, is calculated on
            behalf of the
            Association of Banks in Singapore, based on submissions by banks
            including London-based Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), Singapore's DBS
            Group Holdings Ltd. and New York-based JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            Edinburgh-based RBS last year withdrew from the panel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenny Feder, chairman of the SFEMC and group head of
            financial markets at London-based Standard Chartered, didn't
            return three calls to his mobile phone. John Lim, an external
            spokesman for the Association of Banks, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The monetary authority isn't planning to impose criminal
            sanctions on the banks or any employees, said two of the people.
            MAS will probably require some of the banks to set aside funds
            as a deposit with the central bank for a period of time and
            strengthen their internal controls, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Visa Europe's Bid to End EU Card-Fee Probe Faces Market Test &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European Union antitrust regulators invited comments on
            Visa Europe Ltd.'s offer to cut 'significantly' the fees it
            sets for processing cross-border credit-card payments in a bid
            to end an EU antitrust probe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's offer from last month would bring its fees
            into line with those of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
            European Commission said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The
            operator of the EU's largest payment-card network has also
            offered to overhaul its rules so that banks will be able to
            apply a reduced interbank fee when they compete for clients
            across borders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the proposals address the commission's competition
            concerns, the commission may decide to make them legally binding
            on Visa Europe' in exchange for ending the probe, the regulator
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission sent a formal complaint to Visa about the
            interchange fees last year, as part of a broader campaign it has
            waged against such charges. MasterCard has started a legal
            challenge against a settlement it reached with the commission in
            2009 to avoid a daily penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of
            sales. The EU is also probing MasterCard's bank fees on foreign
            card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the 27-nation
            bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe declined to comment beyond statements made when
            the commitments were offered last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-Bradford Bingley Banker May Be Fined in Secret FCA Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chris Willford, former group finance director at
            nationalized lender Bradford Bingley Plc, may be fined as much
            as 100,000 pounds ($157,000) for risk management failures after
            losing a court appeal yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority's predecessor properly
            notified Willford of the fine in 2010, Judge Martin Moore-Bick
            said. Willford's identity had been secret throughout the three-year-old dispute until the court yesterday
            overturned
            restrictions that limited the press to calling him 'C.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bradford Bingley was rescued by the British government in
            2008 after credit markets froze in the wake of Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc.'s collapse. Willford didn't do enough to warn the
            board about its deteriorating financial position, FCA lawyer
            Michael Brindle said at a February court hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA's decision to fine Willford 100,000 pounds was
            overturned by a judge in May 2012 because he ruled the
            regulator, then known as the Financial Services Authority,
            didn't give proper reasons in the notice of its decision. The
            court of appeal reversed that ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fine hasn't been confirmed and Willford may still
            challenge it at a higher tribunal that hears regulatory
            disputes. Willford is now chief operating officer at online
            storage company My Wealth Cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nikunj Kiri, his lawyer, declined to comment after the
            ruling. Chris Hamilton, a spokesman for the FCA, also declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judge Moore-Bick rejected Willford's request for an
            extension of the privacy order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is The Queen on the Application of Christopher
            Willford v. Financial Services Authority, Court of Appeal,
            Queen's Bench Division (Administrative Court) C1/2012/1551. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Austrian Central Banker Charged on Syrian Money Bribe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Austrian prosecutors charged nine people, including the
            vice-governor at the national bank, with bribery and money
            laundering in connection with money-printing deals in Syria and
            Azerbaijan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wolfgang Duchatczek, 63, and the unnamed co-defendants paid
            14 million euros ($18.6 million), or as much as 20 percent of
            order volumes, to win contracts, according to a statement from
            Nina Bussek, a spokeswoman for the Vienna prosecutor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The charges follow an 18-month investigation into
            Oesterreichische Banknoten-und Sicherheitsdruck GmbH, the money-printing press owned by the central bank.
            Duchatczek headed the
            unit's supervisory board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duchatczek's lawyer, Gabriel Lansky, said via telephone
            that his client isn't guilty. Duchatczek, whose term ends in
            July, said when reached by mobile phone that he wouldn't comment
            before having the opportunity to study the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank's general council will hold a special
            meeting June 18 to discuss the matter, according to a statement
            from the Vienna-based institution. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Paradise Lost Facing Expats in Cayman Work Visa Crackdown</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Smith was so taken by the mix of white sand, blue waters and modern offices when her
            cruise ship called at the Cayman Islands that the New Jersey accountant found a job and moved to what she
            calls paradise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We still have regulatory deadlines and long hours, but if I need a
            break, our office is right across from the beach,' said Smith, 29, who has worked the past three years at
            financial services company BDO Cayman Islands, and has no plans to leave. 'It's hard to imagine going
            anywhere else.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet foreign workers face that prospect and new arrivals could find it
            tougher to make the island their home as restrictions tighten. With unemployment among local citizens
            exceeding 10 percent, the offshore financial center is reining in the number of staff that funds, accounting
            firms, construction companies and hotels hire from abroad. Limits on expatriates, who make up half the
            island's 39,000 workforce, will ensure more jobs for Caymanians, said Eric Bush, the nation's chief
            immigration officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We'll always need a certain level of foreign labor, but it's about
            finding that right balance,' Bush said in a phone interview. 'We're a small nation that cannot have an
            influx of individuals who may turn out to be a burden.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 2,000 foreigners face
            expulsion in October when their work visas expire. Premier Alden McLaughlin, who took office last month, has
            made it 'quite clear' to his immigration department that he wants to find a way to keep them while still
            reducing unemployment for Caymanians, Bush said. The island also wants to remain hospitable to its offshore
            finance industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Seeking Balance &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In seeking a balance,
            McLaughlin's ruling party has vowed to require foreigners work on the island for 10 years before they can
            apply for citizenship, up from seven now. The government also plans to scrap a provision that enables
            companies to pick 'key' workers who could extend their stay for two-year increments indefinitely, which is
            'effectively controlled by employers and unfair to employees' and prevents Caymanians from getting the same
            jobs, according to a report on term limits completed for the government last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calls
            by Caymanians and politicians to tighten immigration rules have risen as unemployment among Cayman citizens
            rose to 10.5 percent last year from 9.7 percent in 2011. In contrast, 2.4 percent of expatriates were out of
            work compared with 3.1 percent in the same time periods, labor statistics show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of
            the job losses have been in construction and hotel services, yet those have 'exacerbated' tensions with
            locals in financial companies that rely on foreign workers, said Chris Duggan, president of the Cayman
            Islands Chamber of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial Industry &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies are
            training more locals for financial industry jobs, he said. 'We're going to have a wave of well-educated
            Caymanians come through the ranks of finance one day,' Duggan said. 'For now, we don't have enough to fill
            these positions.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A British Overseas Territory located about 270 miles south of Cuba,
            the Cayman Islands has registered at least 10,900 funds, more than any other Caribbean island. Financial
            services account for 8.9 percent of jobs, according to its statistics agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moody's
            Investors Service affirmed Cayman Islands bonds at Aa3 in February, the same as Bermuda and China, citing
            incomes of $53,253 per capita that help buffer the population against natural disasters. Even so, tourism
            and finance contribute more than 70 percent of gross domestic product, 'a sign of limited diversification'
            that leaves the country vulnerable during a downturn, Moody's said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there are
            steady openings for fund managers and legal jobs, companies are under pressure by the government to hire
            locally and face costly fees to bring in foreign workers, said Gillian McMahon, a job recruiter with the
            Grand Cayman-based employment agency Baraud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hire Caymanians &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There
            is a want to fill positions with someone from Cayman whenever possible,' McMahon said in a telephone
            interview. 'It's definitely a consideration with every hire if it's going to be Caymanian or foreign.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A two-year work permit for a foreign auditor can cost $16,500 and large firms may pay more than
            $21,000 for a visa for financial controllers, according to McMahon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The situation facing
            the 2,000 foreigners whose visas are scheduled to expire in October arises from immigration changes in 2004
            when the government adopted a seven-year term limit instead of the indefinite policy that had existed.
            Foreigners would have to leave for at least a year, though companies could apply to have 'key employees'
            exempted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Limit Eligibility &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law is meeting its purpose of
            limiting the number of people eligible to become permanent residents or apply for citizenship, which is
            possible in the eighth year of residency, the report found. As the seven-year limit, known locally as the
            'rollover,' approached in 2011, the government allowed terms to be extended for up to two years while a
            review committee completed its report and to allow changes in the laws to be adopted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            rollover will destroy my life as I have given 14 years to this island,' said one unnamed survey respondent
            in comments included in the study. 'Have made this my home and now you want to kick me out.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            the Cayman Islands tightens conditions for expatriates, Bermuda has loosened them, ending a limit on how
            long foreigners can work there as it seeks to lure funds and reinsurance companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abolishing
            limits 'will help spark economic growth and create employment opportunities for Bermudians,' Home Affairs
            Minister Michael Fahy said in a Jan. 30 statement after the rule was changed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bermuda
            Unemployment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 10 percent of Bermudians were unemployed last year compared with 2
            percent of foreigners, with financial services and 'international business activity' accounting for the
            largest number of jobs, according to a 2012 labor survey by island nation's government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cayman's
            restrictions on foreign workers have made it harder to recruit employees and caused office tensions between
            islanders and expatriates, according a survey of about 100 business owners that was commissioned as part of
            last year's report for the government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In responses of 384 Caymanians in that same
            survey, 58 percent said they wanted 'keep or modify' foreign work restrictions, with one saying that it was
            'unfair' that foreigners held jobs when 'Caymanians needed a chance at moving up the corporate ladder.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 2,600 expatriates worked as fund administrators and accountants in the Caymans as of
            December, 2011, the most after service jobs such as bartenders and beach attendants, the report found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Have Roots &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's a worry that people will have to leave,' said Joanna
            Boxall, who runs a website for expatriates working on the island, caymannewresident.com. 'Accountants and
            lawyers have bought houses, they have roots here,' she said. 'Law firms are booming, banks are doing well,
            and they still need experts.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As long as she has an accounting job at BDO, Smith said
            it's 'only a matter of time' before she and her husband probably buy a home on the Caymans and settle in. He
            moved with her from Jackson, New Jersey, and also has a job in accounting. Both have renewed their initial
            two-year visas and hope to stay as long as possible, at least for the seven years currently allowed and
            longer if allowed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It would feel like leaving family if we were to uproot ourselves and
            leave the island,' Smith said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Macau Tightens Chinese Visitor Stays in Visa-Abuse Crackdown</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Macau will reduce the maximum number
            of days that Chinese passport holders with transit visas can
            stay in the city to five from seven, in an attempt to prevent
            them from abusing the law. Casino shares dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Transit visitors from China who don't depart for another
            destination within the five days will be in violation of the new
            rules, effective July 1, and will be penalized upon their next
            visit, the city's Public Security Police Force said in a
            statement yesterday. Repeat violations will result in denial of
            entry, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese tourists have been driving the revenue of casino
            companies in the world's largest gambling hub, including Sands
            China Ltd. (1928) and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) They are
            competing for gamblers by adding malls, theaters and restaurants
            at their resorts. An improved rail connection and an increase in
            hotel rooms are helping draw more vacationing Chinese to Macau
            and the country's only legal casinos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We do not think this new policy will have a measurable
            impact on gaming revenue,' Grant Govertsen at investment bank
            Union Gaming Group said today. 'It is important to keep in mind
            that most high-value casino customers typically come to Macau
            about four times per year.' Most visitors to Macau only stay a
            day or two, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mainland Chinese tourists accounted for two-thirds of the
            total visitors to Macau in the first quarter, according to
            government data. Travelers to the Chinese city stayed for less
            than two days on average in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High-Stakes Segment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) fell 1.4 percent to close at HK$24
            in Hong Kong trading, while Wynn Macau Ltd. dropped 2.4 percent
            and Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. declined 2.7 percent. Sands
            China and SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) dropped 1.4 percent and 1 percent,
            while Galaxy lost 1 percent. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng
            Index fell 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulatory change 'aims to prevent Chinese passport
            holders from using transit as an excuse to stay in Macau, when
            they actually have not gone to their destination,' the
            government department said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2013, 2.08 million mainland Chinese arriving in Macau
            using a transit visa didn't go on to a third-party country,
            representing 11.2 percent of total mainland Chinese visitors for
            the year, Union Gaming's Govertsen wrote in a note last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Casino operators in Macau are expanding their footprint in
            the city. Galaxy is spending HK$20 billion ($2.6 billion) on the
            resort's second phase in the increasingly popular Cotai area.
            The project is slated to add as many as 500 gaming tables and
            1,300 rooms at JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Macau casino revenue rose 9.3 percent to 32.4 billion
            patacas ($4.1 billion) last month, according to data on the
            website of the city's Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Amazon.com, 7-Eleven Sue Visa and MasterCard Over Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and 7-Eleven Inc.
            sued Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over card fees after
            rejecting a multibillion-dollar settlement in an antitrust case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The retailers and about 30 others filed a lawsuit in
            federal court in Manhattan against the card companies and
            several major banks. The companies are among more than 7,000
            that have dropped out of the $7.25 billion accord over the fees,
            which are borne by merchants when customers use credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once Visa and MasterCard acquired substantial market
            power over merchants, they maintained it by forcing merchants to
            pay even higher interchange fees to continue to fund these
            price-fixing schemes,' the retailers said in the complaint
            filed today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement, under consideration by a federal judge in
            Brooklyn, New York, would put to rest about eight years of
            litigation in the nationwide suit. Dozens of retailers have said
            they're opposed to the accord because it would give Visa and
            MasterCard too much freedom to raise rates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These same tired arguments were already raised repeatedly
            over the course of the litigation,' Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman
            for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card
            companies and banks, said in a statement. 'Had these arguments
            had any merit or strength, they would have been included in the
            final settlement.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Other Retailers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other retailers that dropped out of the settlement have
            also filed their own lawsuits, including CVS Pharmacy Inc. (CVS) and
            a group led by Target Corp. (TGT) and Macy's Inc. (M) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa sued Wal-Mart Stores Inc. this month over concerns
            that the world's largest retailer would also file a separate
            swipe-fee complaint. The payment network said in a complaint
            that it wanted to prevent 'the continuation of endless,
            wasteful litigation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is 7-Eleven Inc. v. Visa Inc., 13-cv-4442, U.S.

        <headline>South Africa Tourism Groups Say New Visa Rules May Curb Visitors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;South Africa's tightening of visa
            rules to combat child trafficking may also deter foreign
            visitors, industry groups have told Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The restrictions, proposed by the Home Affairs Ministry and
            due to come into effect at the end of September, will require
            parents and guardians traveling with minor children to be in
            possession of their unabridged birth certificates. Visitors will
            also have to report in person to visa offices to provide
            biometric data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Industry stakeholders argue that these measures may
            impact on the competitiveness of our destination in an era where
            countries are attempting to ease visa requirements,' Hanekom
            said in an e-mailed statement. 'Any matter that could have a
            detrimental impact on international tourist arrivals to South
            Africa is a concern.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 9 million tourists visit South Africa each year.
            The government is targeting annual income of 500 billion rand
            ($47 billion) from tourism by 2020 and 225,000 new jobs as it
            seeks to cut a 25 percent unemployment rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourism department officials are working with their
            counterparts at home affairs to clarify any misunderstanding
            about the new rules and resolve any problems that may arise,
            Hanekom said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Televisa Drops From Record High as Citigroup Cuts Stock to Hold</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB, Mexico's largest
            television broadcaster, fell from a record high after Citigroup
            Inc. lowered the stock to the equivalent of hold on concern
            revenue growth will slow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares (TLEVICPO) fell 1.2 percent to 90.10 pesos at 10:15 a.m. in
            Mexico City in the worst performance on the benchmark IPC index
            after construction company Empresas ICA SAB. The stock rallied
            yesterday to a record high 91.15 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup cut sales and profit estimates for the Mexico
            City-based company in 2014 and 2015 and reduced the stock's
            price target to 96 pesos from 98 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The shares are less enticing than before,' Citigroup
            analysts led by Julio R. Zamora wrote in a research report
            published today. 'We expect higher advertising revenues, but
            lower revenues in network subscription, licensing, sky and cable
            television.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Says Fraud Costs to Escalate as Hackers Innovate</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Payment networks, retailers and
            banks will continue to face significant costs to address fraud
            as hackers find new ways to steal data, according to Byron Pollitt, chief financial officer of Visa Inc. (V)
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is an investment cycle that never ends,' Pollitt
            said today at a technology conference in San Francisco. 'The
            resourcefulness, the intellect, the level of innovativeness in
            the fraud sector is absolutely amazing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders and merchants are under pressure to convert from
            magnetic strips to microchip technology that thwarts hackers
            after millions of consumer records were breached at retailers
            including Target Corp. One reason the conversion hasn't happened
            yet is because it's expensive for merchants to upgrade their
            systems and for lenders to issue new cards, said Pollitt, whose
            company is the world's biggest bank-card network. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's high investment and in the absence of a Target
            catalyst, I doubt that we would be on the track we are on
            today,' Pollitt said. The chip will address about 70 percent of
            fraud, he said. Including a requirement that consumers enter
            personal identification numbers, or PINs, would 'dramatically'
            slow its implementation because about two-thirds of retailers
            don't have the necessary equipment, Pollitt said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American Express Co., Foster City, California-based Visa
            and MasterCard Inc. have given most U.S. merchants and issuers
            until October 2015 to adopt chips -- named EMV for founders
            EuroPay International, MasterCard and Visa. Those that refuse
            would assume liability for counterfeit card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They are also pushing retailers to use 'tokenization,'
            where some account information is replaced with a digital ID for
            online and mobile purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>EU Halts Russian Trade, Visa Talks With Threat of More Curbs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;European Union governments halted
            trade and visa negotiations with Russia and prepared sanctions
            against selected Russian officials to protest the Kremlin's
            assertion of control over Ukraine's southern Crimea region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EU leaders sent the diplomatic signals at a summit in
            Brussels today that pitted western European countries keen to
            offer Russia more time to pull back its forces before imposing
            sanctions against eastern countries demanding retribution now. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We must consider measures that have far-reaching
            consequences for the EU-Russia relationship,' U.K. Prime
            Minister David Cameron told reporters after the meeting. Cameron
            cited the potential 'consequences' of such action on the
            U.K.'s banks or on France's defense industry, saying they were
            worth it 'if you are going to stand up to aggression.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some western European leaders had sought to delay
            sanctions, shifting to a tougher stance after the parliament of
            Crimea voted today to hold a referendum on March 16 on becoming
            part of Russia. The EU was also swayed by the presence of
            Ukraine's new pro-western prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who
            accused the Kremlin of putting up a new Berlin Wall. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'This Wall' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Tear down this wall, the wall of intimidation, the wall
            of military aggression,' Yatsenyuk said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The time-out on the commercial talks echoed the bloc's
            response to Russia's invasion of another neighbor, Georgia, in
            2008. Those contacts were resumed after two months and failed to
            dislodge the Russian troops that remain on parts of Georgia's
            territory. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EU President Herman Van Rompuy said things will be
            different this time, noting that Russia is keen on expanded
            trade and improved European travel opportunities for its
            citizens. Van Rompuy called today's EU decisions a surprise for
            the outside world and said the leaders 'were very determined.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Besides suspending talks on trade and the easing of travel
            visas, the leaders ordered the EU foreign service to draw up a
            list of Russian officials who could be targeted with asset
            freezes in a future round of sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That decision followed yesterday's freezing of European
            bank accounts of 18 members of Ukraine's former pro-Russian
            regime, including the ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. The
            U.S. targeted some unidentified Russians today in restricting
            visas deemed a threat to Ukraine's security. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Van Rompuy declined to say whether a future blacklisting
            would cover Russian President Vladimir Putin or members of his
            inner circle. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Black Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The summit had loomed as a deadline for Putin to withdraw
            forces to bases which Russia leases in Crimea, where its Black
            Sea Fleet is headquartered. On March 3, EU foreign ministers
            demanded that Russia 'immediately' take 'de-escalating
            steps' or face consequences. Putin says the Russian troops
            stationed there have only been securing their bases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EU leaders called again today for an immediate withdrawal
            and demanded that Russia stop blocking access to Crimea by
            monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
            Europe. A statement urged Russia to enter roundtable talks over
            Ukraine's future, without setting a fixed deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Russia-Ukraine standoff plunged the EU back into the
            emergency diplomacy that dominated the euro-area debt crisis.
            The divide between the richer north and poorer south that marked
            the economic crisis gave way today to a renewal of the east-west
            divisions over ties with Russia that have plagued the bloc since
            it absorbed former Soviet satellite countries a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'No Enthusiasm' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said a pledge by
            Ukraine's Yatsenyuk to sign a European trade pact shifted the
            mood among the 28 leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's no enthusiasm for tough steps like sanctions,'
            Tusk said. 'But everybody understands that Russia's stance
            today, combined with Ukraine's situation and the EU's
            obligations, requires such measures.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Europe's fiscal crisis also cast an economic shadow over
            the meeting, lessening the will to curb commercial ties with
            Russia. Germany, Europe's largest economy, relies on Russia for
            35 percent of its gas and oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;France, for example, won't yet suspend military contracts
            with Russia, President Francois Hollande said. Russia in 2011
            bought two 'Mistral' warships from France for more than $1
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We respect the contracts that we have signed,' Hollande
            said. 'We haven't reached that level yet. And we want to avoid
            getting there.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel held out the prospect of
            additional steps against Russia including 'a broad palette of
            economic measures' if Crimea is further destabilized. She said
            EU leaders might meet again before their regularly scheduled
            March 20-21 gathering to decide on possible further sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European leaders also agreed to add 1 billion euros ($1.4
            billion) to the 610 million euros in emergency aid that the EU
            plans to disburse once Ukraine strikes a standby agreement with
            the International Monetary Fund. Those cash injections to avert
            a Ukrainian default would form the nucleus of a package of
            grants and project loans that could top 11 billion euros over
            seven years, the European Commission said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

            technology to thwart fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group was established following recent retail data
            breaches, Purchase, New York-based MasterCard said today in an
            e-mailed statement. The group, whose other members weren't
            identified, will focus on security issues that address in-store
            and online purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders and merchants are under pressure to convert card
            security from magnetic strips to microchips after millions of

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Buse, a top executive at
            Visa (V) Inc. who previously ran most of the firm's international
            business, is leaving after more than 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buse, 53, was most recently the head of the global-solutions group, Foster City, California-based
            Visa said today
            in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
            Buse is retiring March 31, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Throughout her career, Elizabeth has worked tirelessly to
            build a stronger, more effective and engaged Visa,' Chief
            Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, 48, said in a statement. 'I
            am thankful for the foundation she has created for us to work
            from and wish her well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa also said today that Ramon Martin, a former president
            of merchant services at American Express Co. (AXP), will be joining
            the firm. Martin will lead work related to merchant products
            that Buse previously did, according to a person familiar with
            the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are
            private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buse was appointed to her role in the new global-solutions
            unit in May. She started her career at Visa in the product-organization group and was the first executive to
            oversee the
            firm's business in the Asia Pacific, Central and Eastern Europe,
            Middle East and Africa regions, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Visa fell 2.3 percent to $220.83 at 3:28 p.m. in
            New York. They have decreased less than 1 percent this year, and
            were the sixth-best performer in the 30-company Dow Jones
            Industrial Average for 2013, rising 47 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is protesting Saudi
            Arabia's denial of a visa to a Jerusalem Post journalist who
            wants to cover President Barack Obama's visit there this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A journalist's employer shouldn't 'count against their
            ability to do their job,' Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said at a briefing today. He said the
            U.S. reached out
            through 'multiple channels' to protest the denial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Wilner, White House correspondent for the Jerusalem
            Post, was the only member of the White House press corps
            traveling with Obama this week to be denied a visa by Saudi
            Arabia, the White House Correspondents Association said today in
            an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wilner planned to cover only the Saudi Arabia part of
            Obama's six-day trip, which also includes stops in the
            Netherlands, Belgium and the Vatican, the group said. In Saudi
            Arabia, Obama plans to discuss Syria, Iran and the Mideast peace
            talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The denial is an affront not only to this journalist, but
            to the entire White House press corps and to the principle of
            freedom of the press that we hold so dear,' Steve Thomma, the
            group's president, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wilner is a U.S. citizen and is Jewish, according to an
            article in the Jerusalem Post online today. &lt;/p&gt;

            almost 70 percent of broadcast viewers, to benefit from rules
            that would require America Movil's Telmex subsidiary to wait at
            least two years before applying for pay television licenses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If America Movil enters that sector it will be very
            competitive,' Valeria Romo, an analyst with Banco Monex SA,
            said in a phone interview from Mexico City. 'In the short term,
            Televisa can propel growth in television.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;America Movil, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, has
            fallen 5.2 percent since President Enrique Pena Nieto announced
            the proposal March 24, the biggest two-day decline since August.
            Mexico City-based Televisa rose 3.8 percent in that time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed restrictions on America Movil stem from the
            government's efforts to clamp down on its dominance in the
            telecommunications industry, where it services 70 percent of
            Mexico's mobile-phone users and 80 percent of fixed lines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The restriction on America Movil 'opens Televisa up to
            participate in other sectors of telecommunications' as it
            maintains its TV strategy, Romo said. 'The regulation in media
            is less aggressive than in telecommunications.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Putin Touts Russian Proxy for Visa, MasterCard After Sanctions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin said
            Russia must develop its own payments network, with companies
            that blocked some transactions following U.S. sanctions on
            Russian individuals and a bank at risk of losing market share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This wasn't our decision,' Putin said at a meeting with
            lawmakers outside Moscow today, adding that developing a
            domestic system will take time. 'We need to defend our
            interests. And we'll do that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) stopped processing cards for
            Bank Rossiya after the U.S. placed the lender on its sanctions
            list. SMP Bank, which also had its cards blocked by the two
            biggest card networks, said March 23 that services would resume
            soon. SMP Bank's co-owners Arkady Rotenberg and brother Boris
            were also hit with sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sanctions prohibit U.S. firms or individuals from doing
            business with Bank Rossiya, the U.S. Treasury said on its
            website on March 20. Russia's 17th biggest lender has about $10
            billion in assets, 'numerous relationships' with banks in the
            U.S. and Europe, and was targeted because its owners are close
            associates of President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Putin last week said he would open his personal account in
            the bank targeted by the U.S. and have his salary payments
            transfered there. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Profit Beats Estimates as Card Spending Rises</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects worldwide spending total in eighth paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world's biggest
            payments network, posted a fiscal second-quarter profit that
            beat analysts' estimates as consumer spending on credit and
            debit cards climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended March 31 fell 1.7
            percent to $1.27 billion, or $1.92 a share, from $1.29 billion,
            or $1.91, a year earlier, when there were more shares
            outstanding, the Foster City, California-based company said
            today in a statement. That beat the $1.81 average estimate of 32
            analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net income a year earlier was
            helped by a one-time tax-related gain of $208 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa, led by Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf,
            increased dividends and stepped up share repurchases as the firm
            gained financial flexibility after joining rival MasterCard Inc. (MA)
            in agreeing to a multibillion settlement with merchants over
            card swipe fees. Visa also struck a deal in February with
            JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. card lender, to let the
            bank tailor payment solutions for merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'To drive future transaction growth, we continue to invest
            in new technologies, channels and capabilities to make Visa
            transactions more valuable, accessible and secure,' Scharf, 48,
            said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The payment processor raised its forecast for adjusted
            annual earnings per share growth to about 20 percent, from the
            'high teens' projected in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shares Advance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa climbed 2.1 percent to $169.50 at 4:42 p.m. in
            extended trading in New York. The shares climbed 9.5 percent
            this year through the close of regular trading, outpacing the
            4.2 percent advance for the 70-company Standard Poor's 500
            Information Technology Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard, the world's second-largest payments network by
            processed transactions, said earlier today that first-quarter
            profit increased 12 percent to $766 million. Revenue at the
            Purchase, New York-based firm climbed 8.4 percent to $1.91
            billion, short of the $1.93 billion estimate of analysts in a
            Bloomberg survey. The shares, which touched an all-time high
            yesterday, fell 2.5 percent to $539.18, the most since July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa's total operating revenue climbed 15 percent to $2.96
            billion, beating the $2.85 billion estimate of analysts surveyed
            by Bloomberg. Worldwide spending on Visa payment cards climbed
            8.8 percent to $1.03 trillion, adjusted for currency
            fluctuations, according to the statement. Processed transactions
            rose 6.2 percent to 13.9 billion. Cross-border volume, a measure
            of spending by cardholders outside their home countries,
            advanced 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spending on Visa debit cards in the U.S. rose 0.3 percent
            to $285 billion, the first increase in a year, according to the
            statement. U.S. credit-card purchases climbed 9.1 percent to
            $244 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent
            of the nation's economy, cooled in March after higher payroll
            taxes took effect in January. Scharf seeks to bolster Visa's
            growth outside the U.S. as the company has said it hopes to get
            more than half of its revenue abroad by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) is stepping up dealmaking to reach one of the fastest growing U.S.
            audiences: Latinos with a taste for drama. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Televisa's president of content, Jose Baston,
            said the company is currently in negotiations to develop exclusive shows for video-streaming provider
            Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Last year, Televisa distributed the highest grossing Spanish-language film of all time
            in the U.S., 'Instructions Not Included.' About 3 million viewers watched last year's finale of 'Devious
            Maids,' a Lifetime drama based on a Televisa format. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Televisa is tapping into the U.S.
            Hispanic community, estimated to make up a fifth of the country's population by 2025, as the company becomes
            the target of Mexican regulators for reaching more than 70 percent of broadcast audiences there. Televisa
            already provides Netflix users in Latin America with more than 3,000 hours of content, including the soap
            operas it helped popularize over the past 50 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's not enough content yet
            that's directly aimed at them,' said Phil Contrino, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. 'You're not really
            worrying about crossover potential because there's enough of an audience there. Slapstick comedy with very
            serious melodrama, it connected. It's what the audience wants.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Europe Offers to Cap Credit-Card Fees to End EU Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. plans to
            'significantly' reduce the fees it sets for processing cross-border credit-card payments in a bid to allay
            European Union
            competition concerns, the bloc's antitrust watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's offer would bring its fees in line with those
            of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the European Commission
            said today. The operator of the EU's largest payment-card
            network also committed to overhaul its rules so that banks will
            be able to apply a reduced cross-border interbank fee when they
            compete for clients cross-border. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It will put at the same level the fees that are used by
            MasterCard and by Visa and this will allow cheaper use of cards
            that are a payment system used in almost half of our total
            payments in the EU,' Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust
            commissioner, said in a video statement. Visa Europe's offer
            will mean 'the two big credit and debit card companies' can't
            use 'their market position to have extra profits.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe proposed to reduce by 40 percent to 60 percent
            its so-called interbank fees for credit-card payments to a level
            of 0.3 percent of the value of the transaction for cross-border
            and domestic transactions, the commission said. The remedies
            would last for four years. Visa Europe was sent a formal
            complaint over the levies last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Test &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia said antitrust officials will carry out a so-called
            market test with industry groups before deciding to make the
            commitments legally binding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Merchants will now be able to benefit from centralizing
            their acquiring in one place, which will bring benefits to the
            European economy as a whole,' said Ruth Milligan, senior
            adviser on payments at EuroCommerce, a group representing EU
            retailers including Carrefour SA (CA) and Ikea Group. Acquiring banks
            are those that process card payments on behalf of shops and
            traders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have long argued that the card scheme's rule on cross-border acquiring were wholly contrary to
            single market
            principles and are delighted to see them go,' said Milligan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard in 2009 in a settlement with the Brussels-based EU regulator agreed to similar fee
            changes to avoid a
            daily penalty of as much as 3.5 percent of sales. MasterCard is
            appealing that decision at the EU courts in Luxembourg. Last
            month, the EU said it is probing MasterCard's bank fees on
            foreign card payments such as when tourists go shopping in the
            27-nation bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inflate Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's so-called multilateral interchange fees
            'harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of
            payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase
            consumer prices,' the commission said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An earlier probe into Visa Europe's fees for debit-card
            payments made outside a user's home country was settled in 2011.
            The company split from Visa Inc. (V) before the U.S. card company's
            initial public offering in early 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Today's outcome is the result of constructive dialogue
            between Visa Europe and the European Commission and is in line
            with the level of 0.3 percent established in the industry,'
            Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe's chief executive officer, said in an
            e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa, MasterCard Swipe Deal Draws Little Rock Objection</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Little Rock, Arkansas, objected to a
            multibillion-dollar settlement of a price-fixing case against
            Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over the fees charged to merchants
            to process credit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement doesn't address potential future fixing of
            the so-called interchange or swipe fees and contains
            'unacceptable obligations,' City Manager Bruce T. Moore said
            in a filing today in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, where
            the agreement is under review. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed $7.25 billion settlement, estimated to be the
            largest-ever U.S. antitrust accord, has drawn criticism from
            trade associations and retailers, which contend that it grants
            the card companies too much leeway to raise rates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), the
            world's largest retailer, said in a statement in July that it
            was 'disappointed' in the settlement and would encourage
            merchants to reject the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Little Rock, the state capital and home to department-store
            chain Dillard's Inc. (DDS), said it was protesting the settlement in
            its capacity as a potential member of a class that has accepted
            Visa and MasterCard credit-card payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, the city of Oakland, California, also filed an
            objection to the settlement today. The city, which also accepts
            credit-card payments, said the accord 'explicitly permits Visa
            and MasterCard to continue to fix interchange fees for their
            banks,' forcing consumers to pay higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Higher Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Interchange fees on credit card transactions result in
            higher prices for Oakland's residents, and amount to a hidden
            and regressive tax on goods and services,' the city said in its
            objection, filed by attorney Jeffrey Shinder, who is also
            representing several trade associations that oppose the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of objections have been filed since U.S. District
            Judge John Gleeson gave a preliminary sign-off to the deal in
            November, including many from smaller retailers and merchants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Large retailers including Target Corp. (TGT) and Home Depot Inc. (HD)
            have also spoken out against the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last month, Gleeson ordered that corrections be made to
            websites established by groups opposing the settlement,
            including Merchantsobject.com, which directed business owners to
            pages where they could submit objections electronically. The
            judge said that the sites were misleading and failed to
            prominently display a link to a court-approved website,
            paymentcardsettlement.com. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Consider Remedies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At a follow-up hearing earlier this month, Gleeson said he
            would consider remedies for merchants that dropped out of the
            settlement, leaving them unable to receive payments for damages,
            based on what he described as misleading information on the
            sites. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement was unveiled in July after about seven years
            of litigation. A hearing on final approval of the deal, which
            would cover merchants throughout the U.S., is scheduled for
            Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
            Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
            Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Warren's Bank Trials, Visa Probe, Ratings: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has
            questioned three more federal agencies' enforcement practices by
            asking if they've studied the costs of favoring settlements with
            big financial firms over taking them to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Senate Banking
            Committee, had earlier questioned Comptroller of the Currency
            Thomas Curry about why his agency doesn't take wrongdoing
            financial firms to trial, such as in the money-laundering case
            of London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) She sent a similar query in a
            letter yesterday to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke,
            Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White and
            Attorney General Eric Holder. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If large financial institutions can break the law and
            accumulate millions in profits and, if they get caught, settle
            by paying out of those profits, they do not have much incentive
            to follow the law,' Warren said in the letter. She argued
            regulators have 'a lot less leverage' if they show a
            continuing unwillingness to go to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Curry said in a response to Warren last week that the OCC
            hasn't conducted research on the benefits of settling without
            forcing admissions of guilt, according to the letter. Warren is
            putting the same question to Bernanke, White and Holder about
            whether they've conducted research on the trade-offs between
            settling and litigating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;White said in testimony before a House Appropriations
            subcommittee May 7 that the SEC is reviewing its practice of
            settling cases without requiring defendants to admit guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The policy has benefited investors while saving SEC
            resources, White testified. The settlements leave no question
            'about what the conduct was,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Visa Europe Offers to Cap Credit-Card Fees to End EU Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd. plans to 'significantly' reduce the fees
            it sets for processing cross-border credit-card payments in a
            bid to allay European Union competition concerns, the bloc's
            antitrust watchdog said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's offer would bring its fees in line with those
            of its main competitor MasterCard Inc. (MA), the European Commission
            said yesterday. The operator of the EU's largest payment-card
            network also committed to overhaul its rules so that banks will
            be able to apply a reduced cross-border interbank fee when they
            compete for clients cross-border. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe proposed to reduce by 40 percent to 60 percent
            its so-called interbank fees for credit-card payments to a level
            of 0.3 percent of the value of the transaction for cross-border
            and domestic transactions, the commission said. The remedies
            would last for four years. Visa Europe was sent a formal
            complaint over the levies last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, said in a
            video statement that antitrust officials will carry out a so-called market test with industry groups before
            deciding to make
            the commitments legally binding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Europe's so-called multilateral interchange fees
            'harm competition between acquiring banks, inflate the cost of
            payment card acceptance for merchants and ultimately increase
            consumer prices,' the commission said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Today's outcome is the result of constructive dialogue
            between Visa Europe and the European Commission and is in line
            with the level of 0.3 percent established in the industry,'
            Peter Ayliffe, Visa Europe's chief executive officer, said in an
            e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cheung Kong Cancels Hotel-Room Sales After Regulator Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1), the developer controlled by
            Asia's richest man, is canceling the sale of HK$1.4 billion
            ($180 million) of hotel rooms after Hong Kong's securities
            regulator began a probe into the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cheung Kong, controlled by billionaire Li Ka-Shing, will
            return all deposits and part payments plus interest to all the
            buyers of the individual rooms at the Apex Horizon project in
            the city's west, after being notified by the Securities and
            Futures Commission that the sales constitute a unauthorized
            'collective investment scheme,' the developer said in a
            statement to Hong Kong's stock exchange May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale of the 360 hotel rooms in February drew the
            government's ire as it was seen as a means of skirting an
            increase in taxes on apartments that was aimed at cooling
            prices. Within days of the sale, the government extended the
            taxes to include hotels and other commercial property, and sent
            inspectors to check that Apex Horizon units weren't being used
            as residences. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We do not agree' with the SFC, Cheung Kong said in a
            separate e-mailed statement. The decision was made 'as the
            difference in legal opinion may lead to legal uncertainty in
            respect of the sale and purchase of the hotel room units, which
            may affect the buyers' ownership, mortgage arrangement or
            subsequent sale of the hotel room units,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong's securities law requires the regulator's
            authorization before a collective investment scheme can be
            marketed to the public, according to a statement on the SFC's
            website yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SFC intended to start legal proceedings seeking orders
            to unwind the sale, according to the statement. The agreement
            with Cheung Kong avoids court action at this stage, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;EU Confirms Raids on Companies in Oil and Biofuels Sector &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission said antitrust officials raided the
            premises of 'several companies active in and providing services
            to the crude oil, refined oil products and biofuels sectors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These inspections took place in two European Union member
            states, the commission said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The raids took place over concerns the companies 'may have
            colluded in reporting distorted prices to a price reporting
            agency to manipulate the published prices for a number of oil
            and biofuel products,' the commission said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inspections were also carried out on its behalf by the
            European Free Trade Association's Surveillance Authority in one
            European Economic Area member state, the Brussels-based
            commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia
            said officials carried out surprise inspections at 'a number of
            producers of white sugar in several member states,' last month,
            without providing further details. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ranbaxy to Pay $500 Million to Settle Criminal, Civil Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) agreed to pay $500 million to
            resolve fraud allegations made in a whistle-blower's lawsuit and
            federal criminal charges that the company sold adulterated drugs
            while lying about it to U.S. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ranbaxy, in papers filed in federal court in Baltimore May
            13, admitted it sold batches of drugs that were improperly
            manufactured, stored and tested. The company, India's biggest
            drugmaker, also pleaded guilty to making fraudulent statements
            to the Food and Drug Administration about how it tested drugs at
            two of its Indian plants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The resolution of the lawsuits and the criminal charges
            filed yesterday caps allegations about Ranbaxy's practices
            dating to 2003 when the company distributed a batch of acne
            medication it knew had failed a quality test, according to the
            criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In January 2012, Ranbaxy settled an FDA lawsuit by agreeing
            to stop production of drugs for the U.S. market at the two
            plants until they met American standards. In 2007, the whistle-blower's lawsuit, unsealed May 13, alleged
            the company defrauded
            public health-care programs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The felony criminal charges included provision for the
            payment of a fine and forfeiture of funds. The false claims
            portion of the settlement directs the company to pay the U.S.
            and states, as well as the whistle-blower in the civil case,
            Dinesh Thakur, of Belle Mead, New Jersey, a former Ranbaxy
            executive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we are disappointed by the conduct of the past that
            led to this investigation, we strongly believe that settling
            this matter now is in the best interest of all of Ranbaxy's
            stakeholders,' Arun Sawhney, chief executive officer and
            managing director of Gurgaon, India-based Ranbaxy, said in a
            statement. 'The conclusion of the DOJ investigation does not
            materially impact our current financial situation or
            performance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said in the settlement agreement to the lawsuit
            that it denies wrongdoing in the civil case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Ranbaxy U.S.A., 13-cr-00238,
            U.S. District Court, Maryland (Baltimore). The civil case is
            Thakur v. Ranbaxy U.S.A. Inc., 07-cv-00962, U.S. District Court,
            Maryland (Baltimore). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interviews/Panels &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Credit-Ratings Industry Is Oligarchy to Be Broken, Franken Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, said
            financial regulators must intervene in the credit ratings
            industry or risk another U.S. financial 'catastrophe.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'My plea today is that you take action,' Franken said at
            Securities and Exchange Commission credit ratings roundtable in
            Washington yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ratings companies SP (MHP) and Moody's (MCO) didn't give financial
            products 'accurate, objective ratings,' Franken said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, urged
            the SEC to take the 'next steps' to revamp industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Franken said his joint bill with Wicker would require the
            agency to name an independent board that would appoint different
            credit rating agencies to assign ratings based on an agency's
            expertise and eventually its track record. Such a set-up would
            restore trust in the market and allow smaller agencies to break
            up the current 'oligarchy,' Franken said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar, who also spoke at the
            roundtable, said 'the past can't be repeated.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In November, the SEC said credit-ratings companies failed
            to follow their own standards, were late in downgrading deals,
            and delayed disclosure of methodology changes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank requires regulators to stop relying on ratings
            and increase oversight of companies that issue them. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wal-Mart Among Retailers Quitting Visa, MasterCard Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and Starbucks
            Corp. (SBUX) are among 19 retailers opting out of a $7.25 billion
            antitrust settlement with Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) over
            fees charged to merchants to process credit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement would maintain and strengthens an
            anticompetitive system that allows Visa and MasterCard to fix
            so-called swipe fees for banks, the companies said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would allow credit card companies and big banks to
            perpetuate an unfair and broken system that costs all
            consumers,' Mike Cook, senior vice president of finance for
            Wal-Mart, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement, estimated to be the largest-ever U.S.
            antitrust accord, has drawn criticism from trade associations
            and retailers contending that it grants the card companies too
            much leeway to raise rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa, based Foster City, California, and MasterCard, based
            in Purchase, New York, agreed to settle the case to resolve the
            legal battle over interchange fees, which are charged to
            merchants when customers pay with credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement received tentative approval from a federal
            judge in Brooklyn, New York, in November. A hearing on final
            approval is set for Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tech Industry After 2007 Loss Drafts Own Rules for Visas</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Technology companies, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC), have failed at
            almost every turn in their quest to persuade federal lawmakers to let them hire more foreign-born workers.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2003, Congress took back 130,000 temporary work visas. Four years later, Silicon
            Valley was surprised when proposed legislation didn't come close to addressing companies' skilled-worker
            needs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the 2007 loss, the industry took a new tack. Tech leaders helped write
            legislative drafts spelling out what they wanted; they broadened their pitch about immigration to include
            legalizing undocumented immigrants in the country; and they now are using social media to press their case.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We knew we had to get into the game early and go strong,' said Robert Hoffman, senior
            vice president of government relations for the Information Technology Industry Council, which lobbies for
            technology companies. 'We knew we had to think several steps down the road.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silicon
            Valley's role in pushing for changes in immigration law adds economic urgency to a debate that for more than
            a decade has focused mostly on the treatment of 11 million undocumented residents. The tech community's
            engagement also brought to the table companies with the power to mobilize thousands of supporters to join
            ranks with the Latino community. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) plan to
            keep operating in Russia after President Vladimir Putin's
            government backed away from punishing the payments firms in

            market that's shifting from cash to electronic payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
            four Russian banks in response to U.S. sanctions over the crisis
            in Ukraine, Russia passed a law creating its own national
            payments system and imposing rules for foreign firms that
            include fines for denying services and a mandatory security
            deposit starting in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government is committed to working with Visa and
            MasterCard, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an
            interview with Bloomberg TV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moiseev said the U.S. companies agreed to create a
            'nationally important' operator within 18 months. Under the
            new law, such operators are exempt from having to post
            collateral with the central bank, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies have not yet reached a formal agreement and
            'look forward to continuing the dialog,' Paul Cohen, a
            spokesman for Visa, said in a statement. MasterCard's
            suggestions on changes to the new law were 'regarded
            favorably' and the company expects a response soon, according
            to Seth Eisen, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard have said they get about 2 percent of
            their annual revenue from Russia, or about $167 million last
            year for MasterCard and $236 million for Visa. The two control
            about 95 percent of the payments market in Russia, according to
            Morgan Stanley. Visa is based in Foster City, California, and
            runs the world's biggest payments network. MasterCard is based
            in Purchase, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bigger concern may not be the loss of revenue, 'but
            the risk of losing the opportunity for domestic processing in
            Russia,' Darrin Peller, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a
            research note, adding that 80 percent of transactions in Russia
            are done using cash. 'There will likely be a middle ground
            reached.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(A previous version of this story was corrected to remove
            an erroneous combined revenue estimate in the third paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Qiwi Rally Seen Extending as Visa Stays in Russia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A 63 percent rally in Qiwi Plc (QIWI) in
            less than four weeks may be just the beginning for the
            electronic-payment processor as Russia eases restrictions that
            could have crimped its revenue, according to OAO Gazprombank and
            InvestCafe LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qiwi's American depositary receipts have surged to $43.85
            on May 23 from a nine-month low of $26.89 on April 28. The ADRs
            plunged earlier this year as Russia moved to tighten control of
            payment systems and imposed rules that could increase the cost
            of doing business for U.S.-based credit card companies including
            Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
            Index increased 4.5 percent in its fourth consecutive weekly
            gain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers dropped some provisions that could have limited
            online payments as they approved anti-money laundering
            legislation last month. Visa and MasterCard said on May 23 that
            they'll keep working in Russia after the government agreed to
            consider easing demands made on them after the U.S. imposed
            sanctions linked to the country's standoff with Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Traders are shifting their focus to Qiwi's fundamentals
            as the credit card companies' decision to remain in Russia
            signals an improving business environment,' Sergey Vasin, an
            analyst at Gazprombank, said by phone from Moscow on May 23.
            'The trend is positive for Qiwi through the end of the year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vasin said he has begun covering Qiwi and expects to issue
            a recommendation and target price next month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company works in partnership with Visa, providing co-branded accounts marketed under the name
            Visa Qiwi Wallet. Those
            accounts increased increased 20 percent in the first quarter to
            15.6 million, Qiwi Chief Executive Officer Sergey Solonin said
            on a May 21 conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growth Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
            four Russian banks in March as the U.S. imposed sanctions,
            Russia passed a law creating its own national payment system and
            imposing rules for foreign companies that include fining them
            for denying services. Solonin said Qiwi doesn't expect any of
            the new legislation to have much of an impact on its business in
            Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qiwi, which had more than tripled after it was listed in
            New York a year ago, expects net profit to increase between 27
            percent and 29 percent in 2014, according to its May 21 earnings
            statement. Adjusted net revenue increased 46 percent in the
            first quarter to 1.9 billion rubles ($55.6 million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors are focusing on Qiwi's improved growth forecast
            for this year and away from the fading geopolitical risks,'
            Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst at Moscow-based research firm
            InvestCafe, said by phone on May 22. He raised Qiwi to buy from
            hold on May 23, setting a price target at $52.37 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Analyst Ratings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qiwi's 14-day relative strength index reached a nine-month
            high of 80.5 on May 22. When a security's RSI rises above 70,
            it's a signal to some analysts that it is poised to fall. The
            stock has seven buy ratings and three holds, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The 28 percent advance in the five days
            ended May 23 was the biggest weekly gain since its initial
            public offering a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg index of the most-traded Russian stocks in
            the U.S. increased to 88.75 on May 23 to complete the longest
            streak of weekly gains in 10 months. OAO RusHydro, the renewable
            energy producer, led the advance, jumping 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;United Co. Rusal (486), a Moscow-based aluminum producer,
            was little changed at HK$3.24 in Hong Kong trading as of
            11:25 a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Poroshenko Wins &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian stocks had gained as concern eased that Ukraine's
            presidential election would be disrupted. President Vladimir
            Putin said on May 23 in St. Petersburg that Russia will work
            with the next Ukrainian president, even though the vote won't
            meet international standards, after saying he's withdrawing
            troops from the border. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukrainians elected billionaire Petro Poroshenko as
            president, two exit polls showed yesterday, handing him the task
            of stemming deadly separatist violence that's threatening to rip
            the former Soviet republic apart. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Poroshenko garnered more than half of the vote, avoiding a
            runoff with as much as 57.3 percent support, according to the
            surveys. Ex-Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko came second out of
            21 candidates with 12-13 percent backing, the polls showed.
            While most in Ukraine's easternmost regions didn't vote,
            Poroshenko's success was welcomed in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drama in Ukraine will weigh on investors' risk appetite
            and shareholders in Qiwi are exposed to regulatory changes,
            according to David Riedel, founder of the Riedel Research Group
            Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Russian equities will continue to be shunned by most
            investors other than the bravest and most adventurous,' he said
            by e-mail on May 23. 'I would be cautious on the enthusiasm for
            Qiwi payment system as the regulations and control there can be
            implemented very quickly if that avenue is being used to
            transfer money to avoid scrutiny.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that holds Russian
            shares, jumped 5.4 percent last
            week to $25.72, the highest level since February. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; (Updates with Widrich's plan for move in fifth paragraph.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tel Aviv officials
            recognize that the city is becoming a premier destination for technology companies. That's why the local
            government is working on programs to attract more foreign entrepreneurs and to reinforce why the region has
            become known as Silicon Wadi, an Arabic word used colloquially in Hebrew for valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economy
            and Commerce Minister Naftali Bennett has agreed to push for legislation that would create the Startup Visa,
            allowing foreigners with creative muscle to establish residence in Tel Aviv. The city also plans to offer
            free Wi-Fi in all major public places, officials said at a news conference this week, so that programmers
            can tweak their applications while sitting on a bench outside the Habima Theatre or at the Tel Aviv Port.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This
            is a top priority for us now, to keep fostering innovation in the city," Mayor Ron Huldai said on the top
            floor of the Shalom Tower, where a once-neglected public library was converted into a free startup workspace
            overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tel Aviv, which has a population of about 400,000, is
            home to as many as 700 early-stage startups, according to city data. Its vibrant tech scene ranked second in
            the world after Silicon Valley, researcher Startup Genome said in a November report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo
            Widrich, co-founder of social-media app Buffer, relocated his half-dozen employees to Tel Aviv last year
            after moving from San Francisco to Hong Kong. His team chose the Israeli city for its buzzing startup
            community and pleasant weather, Widrich wrote on his blog. weather, Widrich wrote on his blog. He said Tel
            Aviv beat cities such as New York and Rio de Janeiro, but he did plan to move back to the U.S. later in the
            year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffer is not the typical case. (Widrich admitted he only moved out of San Francisco
            because his engineers couldn't get visas.) Silicon Valley attracts the bulk of foreign talent because it has
            the largest stable of venture capital and the world's tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, some
            Israeli companies end up moving to the U.S. when they outgrow their homeland. Waze, the crowdsourced-map
            provider that's seeking $1 billion in acquisition talks with Google and Facebook, moved its headquarters and
            some of its operations from Israel to Palo Alto, California. BillGuard, which helps consumers identify
            errant charges on their credit cards, established its headquarters in New York, though it maintains an
            office on Rothschild Boulevard, an Israel tech hotspot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While about half of Silicon Valley
            startup founders are foreign born, businesses in Tel Aviv are mostly started by Israelis, according to Avner
            Warner, the city's director of International Economic Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vision is that Tel
            Aviv can start to develop a more international startup culture," Warner said. "More foreigners here would
            attract more capital and allow for deeper engagement between locals and global innovators."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On
            a walk along Rothschild Boulevard, Nissim Lehyani might run into venture capitalist Michael Eisenberg or an
            acquaintance from EBay's innovation center. Lehyani runs Easy Social Shop, one of many tech startups with
            offices on the ritzy street in Israel's second-most-populous city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehyani said he's had
            little trouble recruiting engineers to his company, which helps small online merchants market their wares on
            Facebook. Lehyani, like many of the nation's high-tech entrepreneurs, made plenty of connections while
            serving in one of Israel's military-intelligence units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's so much easier to attract
            talent here," Lehyani said. "This city is overflowing with cafes, good food, nice weather and young people.
            It feels as though things here just happen more naturally."&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MasterCard Momentum Over Visa Seen Rising as Europe Recovers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest U.S. payments network, is poised to further outperform
            bigger rival Visa Inc. amid a 3 percent gain by the euro this year and signs that European consumer spending
            is picking up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MasterCard, whose stock has outpaced Visa's in 2013, could gain another
            15 percent in two years as the sovereign-debt crisis eases, said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies
            Group LLC. Europe can boost MasterCard's purchase volume, transactions and revenue for at least the next two
            quarters, Sterne Agee Leach Inc.'s Greg Smith said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MasterCard does more business in
            Europe than Visa, which generates about 2 percent of its revenue in the region. Should Europe's economy and
            currency continue to strengthen at their current pace, Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is more likely to
            see a boost in profits and stock performance, both analysts said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Europe is a
            significant catalyst for MasterCard relative to Visa,' Smith, who has a neutral rating on the company, said
            yesterday in a telephone interview. 'Assuming these general short trends continue, the underlying metrics
            are going to look a little better for MasterCard.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MasterCard said yesterday in a
            statement that third-quarter net income rose 14 percent to $879 million, or $7.27 a share, as Europe credit-
            and debit-card spending climbed 14 percent. Visa, led by Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf, said on
            Oct. 30 that net income fell 28 percent as revenue missed analysts' forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Membership in the so-called 'Great Club' will be offered

        <headline>America Movil Sidesteps Televisa, Azteca to Air Olympics</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;America Movil SAB (AMXL) said it reached an
            agreement to broadcast the 2014 Winter Olympic Games through 26
            of Mexico's regional television networks, sidestepping the two
            major national broadcasters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, Latin America's largest mobile-phone carrier,
            will also air the games on its Claro Sports cable-TV channel and
            on its UnoTV website, it said today in a statement. Mexico City-based America Movil, controlled by
            billionaire Carlos Slim,
            holds exclusive rights for coverage of the Sochi, Russia,
            Olympics across all platforms in Latin America, excluding
            Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement proves America Movil can reach a national
            audience without working with Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) and TV Azteca
            SAB, which dominate Mexico's broadcast-TV ratings. Slim, whose
            companies haven't advertised through the two broadcasters since
            2011, has sought to circumvent them as their media businesses
            come into direct competition with his telecommunications empire. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These will be the Olympic Games with the most coverage in
            the history of Mexico,' Arturo Elias, Slim's spokesman and the
            director of UnoTV, said today in a news conference in Mexico
            City. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Televisa and TV Azteca haven't asked for permission
            to broadcast the games, America Movil remains open to
            programming deals with both broadcasters and other parties, he
            said. America Movil also holds the Latin American rights to
            broadcast the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A press representative at Televisa declined to comment. TV
            Azteca's press office didn't reply to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The broadcast of these Games will be in reach of all
            citizens,' America Movil said. The local broadcasters range
            from Mexico City's Canal 22 to the Baja California Sur State
            Institute of Radio and Television's Canal 8. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), MasterCard Inc. (MA) and
            American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest U.S. payment networks,
            proposed using 'digital tokens' instead of account numbers for
            processing purchases made online and with mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Tokens provide an additional layer of security and
            eliminate the need for merchants, digital wallet operators or
            others to store account numbers,' the companies said today in a
            joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The standard, to be applied worldwide, will be presented to
            other payment firms and industry trade groups in coming weeks,
            according to the statement. Tokens would be the digital
            equivalent of magnetic stripes on the back of plastic bank cards
            that contain customer information. They also may help to reduce
            fraud by providing uniformity as companies such as Google Inc.
            and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) embrace mobile commerce and offer consumers
            new ways to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mobile is the future,' Jim McCarthy, global head of
            innovation and strategic partnerships at Foster City,
            California-based Visa, said during the conference call. 'We
            haven't evolved to create a standard. For the first time, we are
            laying down the foundation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global card fraud losses for banks, merchants and
            processors climbed 15 percent last year to $11.3 billion from
            2011, according to the Nilson Report, a payments industry
            newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. Gross fraud losses
            in 2012 increased to 5.22 cents for every $100 in volume from
            5.07 cents a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EMV-Chip &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tokens also would complement so-called EMV-chip technology,
            which has become a standard in Europe and much of the rest of
            the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is among the last developed nations whose payment
            system relies primarily on cards with magnetic stripes and
            hasn't yet adopted EMV. Standards for the technology are managed
            by EMVCo, which was formed in 1999 by Europay International,
            Visa and Purchase, New York-based MasterCard. New York-based
            AmEx is also an EMVCo member. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As merchants worldwide deploy more EMV terminals, fraud is
            moving toward transactions conducted online or over the
            telephone where physical payment cards aren't present, according
            to an August issue of the Nilson Report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has high fraud losses 'because it leads the world
            in online sales,' according to the trade publication. 'Smaller
            merchants who do not invest in fraud-fighting tools are
            particularly vulnerable.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A 4-foot-tall robot with a video screen for a head swerves past an orange couch and bumps into the

            Charlie Scharf, Visa's chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scharf, who this July day had unveiled
            the latest version of the company's digital wallet, is sitting in an office overlooking San Francisco Bay

        <headline>SmartMetric Loses Patent Ruling in Visa, MasterCard Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) don't
            infringe a patent owned by SmartMetric Inc., a company that had
            sought as much as $13.4 billion for alleged use of its
            technology in 'smart' debit and credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald in Los Angeles,
            in a written ruling yesterday, affirmed his earlier tentative
            decision from a Sept. 25 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The parties here are comparing apples and oranges,' the
            judge said in the written ruling. 'The piecemeal similarities
            that SmartMetric has identified in support of its claims do not
            change the fact that claims 1 and 14 of the '464 patent are
            simply not practiced by defendants, and no reasonable jury could
            conclude otherwise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
            claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
            connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
            a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
            MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
            fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
            microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
            system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
            the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
            Patrick Bright, the company's lawyer, said at the Sept. 25
            hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SmartMetric said in a statement today it will appeal the
            non-infringement ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SmartMetric fell 4 cents, or 20 percent, to 16 cents, today
            in over-the-counter trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International
            Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of
            California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Infosys Makes $35 Million Provision to Settle Visa Case in U.S.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Infosys Ltd. (INFO), India's second-largest
            software exporter, reserved $35 million for a potential
            settlement tied to a U.S. probe into the company's use of visas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is 'engaged in discussions' to reach a civil
            resolution with the U.S. Attorney's office which is
            investigating compliance with visa laws, Bangalore-based Infosys
            said in an e-mailed statement. The company declined to elaborate
            on the talks, which it said are continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Infosys, which reported earnings today, resolved two
            whistle-blower cases in Alabama and California in the past 14
            months after employees alleged it misused so-called B-1 visas,
            temporary business permits, to avoid limits on H-1B employment
            visas. Proposed changes to immigration laws in Congress, which
            would limit the ability of large Indian companies to access H-1B
            visas, may damage Infosys' business model of relying on North
            America for more than 60 percent of its revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Infosys reported second-quarter net income of 24.1 billion
            rupees ($394 million) in the three months ended September. That
            missed the 26.6 billion-rupee median of 46 analysts' estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg, due to the company's 2.2 billion rupee
            provision for 'visa-related matters.' according to the
            company's statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Osborne Pledges Simpler Visa Rules for Chinese Visits to U.K.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said the U.K. will simplify the visa application process
            for Chinese visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Britain will start a pilot program to allow some Chinese
            travel agents to apply for a visa by submitting the same form
            they'll use for a visit the European Union's passport-free
            Schengen Zone, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Osborne is leading a five-day visit to China to promote
            economic links between the two countries, starting in Beijing.
            Among the delegates are London Mayor Boris Johnson and
            representatives of British technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These changes will streamline and simplify the visa
            application process for Chinese visitors, while ensuring the
            system is strong and secure,' Osborne said in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other visa measures include creating a 'super priority'
            service that will start about the middle of next year. A 'VIP
            mobile visa' service now operating in Beijing and Shanghai,
            that reduces the collection process to about five minutes, will
            be expanded to other parts of China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co.
            and Manchester Airports Group said they've formed a venture with
            other partners to build an international business district in
            Manchester, the U.K.'s second-biggest city. The buildings will
            be worth about 800 million pounds ($1.3 billion) when they're
            completed and fully leased, the partners said in a statement.

        <headline>Televisa Tops Profit Estimates on Pay-Television User Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the largest
            Spanish-language TV producer, reported a gain in third-quarter
            profit as new cable and satellite customers led revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Operating-segment profit, which leaves out items such as
            depreciation and amortization, rose 6.1 percent to 7.96 billion
            pesos ($614 million), Mexico City-based Televisa said today in a
            statement. Sales rose 8.1 percent to 18.8 billion pesos,
            compared with the 18.6 billion-peso average of seven analysts'
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Emilio Azcarraga is turning to pay-TV services for growth as advertising
            sales level off for
            Televisa's broadcast-television networks. Cable-TV subscriptions
            rose by more than 58,000 to 2.46 million. Sky satellite-service
            users rose by almost 233,000, in line with the 233,500 average
            estimate of four analysts polled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto reduced government
            spending on advertising this year, while lawmakers set new
            'must-offer' rules, which require Televisa to offer its over-the-air programming to pay-TV rivals for free.
            Televisa reported
            8.79 billion pesos in revenue from television advertising and
            licensing in the third quarter, compared with an average
            estimate of 8.7 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income was 2.39 billion pesos, or 84
            centavos a share, compared with 2.86 billion pesos, or 1.01
            pesos, a year earlier, on higher costs for items such as taxes
            and depreciation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa Profit Matches Estimates as U.S. Retail Sales Strengthen</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world's biggest bank-card network, posted a fiscal fourth-quarter profit that
            matched
            analysts' estimates as U.S. retail spending strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 28
            percent to $1.19 billion, or $1.85 a share, from $1.66 billion,
            or $2.47, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
            company said today in a statement. That equaled the average
            estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Results for the
            fourth quarter of 2012 were helped by a $627 million tax
            adjustment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Retail sales in the U.S., where Visa gets more than half
            its revenue, rose toward the end of the quarter as September's
            0.4 percent gain in purchases excluding vehicles followed a 0.1
            percent increase in August. Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf also has pushed to expand abroad,
            particularly in
            emerging economies, where most spending is still done with cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continued investing in high-growth regions of the
            world, in products and technology to drive our performance,
            while maintaining disciplined expense control,' Scharf, 48,
            said in the statement. 'We also have been consistent and
            decisive in returning excess cash to shareholders and maintain
            this commitment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa fell 0.2 percent to $203.82 at 4 p.m. in New York. The
            shares have increased 34 percent this year, outpacing the 19
            percent advance for the 30-company Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa, which has returned more than $15 billion to investors
            since its 2008 initial public offering, increased the quarterly
            dividend 21 percent to 40 cents last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's still a lot more to do considering how much
            excess cash this company has on its balance sheet,' Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC,
            said in an
            interview before results were announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MasterCard Results &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American Express Co. (AXP), the biggest credit-card issuer by
            purchases and operator of the third-largest U.S. payments
            network, said Oct. 16 that quarterly profit rose 9.3 percent to
            $1.37 billion on higher spending worldwide. Discover Financial
            Services (DFS), the No. 4 network, said last week that net income
            declined 6.9 percent as the company increased the amount of
            money set aside to cover future loan losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest payments network by
            processed transactions, is scheduled to announce results before
            U.S. markets open tomorrow. The Purchase, New York-based company
            may report that third-quarter net income rose 9 percent to
            $841.4 million from a year earlier, according to the average
            estimate of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and the biggest U.S. banks are awaiting
            approval of a multibillion-dollar settlement over fees charged
            to merchants when consumers pay with credit cards. The decision
            by U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York, could
            end an eight-year legal battle pitting the financial firms
            against retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

            sales in 2012, or 47 percent of the company's revenue, according
            to a filing. The Murcia, Spain-based company had sales of 555
            million euros and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
            and amortization of 133 million euros in the year ended June 30,
            Crown said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That implies Crown paid about 9 times Mivisa's earnings
            before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The
            average Ebitda multiple in four acquisitions of packaging
            companies in the past 5 years valued at $100 million or more is
            7.7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mivisa's food-can business earns 24 percent Ebitda margins,
            or double Crown's European food-can margins, due to a much lower
            cost structure, Philip Ng, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC,
            wrote in a note today, referring to Crown by its stock ticker.
            'With investors' appetite for companies with leverage to a
            potential recovery in Europe, we view the acquisition as a
            positive for Crown's margin profile.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crown, which makes containers from beer and soft-drink cans
            to candy boxes and aerosol spray bottles, rose 7.3 percent to
            $43.60 at the close in New York, the most since Aug. 9, 2011.
            The shares have climbed 18 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. was Crown's financial adviser on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa-MasterCard Judge to Weigh Final Approval of Fee Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) will
            ask a judge to put to rest antitrust allegations that have
            plagued the companies for years over fees that are paid by U.S.
            merchants to support the credit card networks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn, New York,
            will hear arguments today over whether to grant final approval
            to a multibillion-dollar class-action settlement on behalf of
            merchants nationwide. Opposed by scores of big-box retailers and
            other consumer businesses, the accord is aimed at ending future
            court battles with U.S. merchants over the practice of setting
            credit card interchange payments, known as swipe fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're seeing this settlement as finally buying them
            some peace,' said Steven Semeraro, a former U.S. Justice
            Department lawyer who isn't involved in the case. 'And that's
            worth it to them, however many billions of dollars it's going to
            cost.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developed by banks half a century ago, Visa and MasterCard
            have been subject to government scrutiny over their business
            practices for decades, Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin wrote in a 2008 report on credit
            card merchant
            restraints. The card firms faced an antitrust suit filed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) and other retailers
            in 1996 and actions by the
            Justice Department, leading to changes in some of their rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank-owned groups spun off the card companies through
            initial public offerings in 2006 and 2008 in a move that
            merchants alleged was intended to dodge antitrust liability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Previous Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not long after Foster City, California-based Visa and
            Purchase, New York-based MasterCard received final approval for
            their previous settlement of more than $4 billion in January
            2004, the current case was brought against them in October 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms thought they would be protected from future
            antitrust lawsuits over interchange fees by releases written
            into the settlement of the earlier Wal-Mart-led case, said
            Semeraro, a professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in
            San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This time, the card companies 'think they really have the
            language in there' and included an 'unbelievably broad'
            release, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It prohibits virtually anyone except an antitrust
            enforcement authority from ever suing them again for anything
            that relates to antitrust claims,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Estimated to be the largest ever in a U.S. antitrust case,
            the settlement is currently valued at about $5.7 billion. In an
            August report, a court-appointed expert said that plaintiffs
            might have difficulty establishing that the companies violated
            antitrust laws at trial and are probably better off with the
            accord. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interchange Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merchants are expected to receive about one-third of a
            year's worth of interchange payments if final approval is
            granted and the order isn't delayed by an appeal. That estimate
            is based on assumptions about the number of merchants that will
            file claims and other factors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard forged ahead with the settlement
            despite objections from hundreds of retailers, including Wal-Mart and Target Corp. (TGT), which contended
            that the releases would
            cover too many of the firms' policies and allow them to raise
            rates in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a conference call with investors this July, MasterCard
            President and Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga disclosed that
            the companies decided not to back out of the accord even though
            a termination provision had been triggered by the volume of
            merchants that dropped out. Some of those merchants have chosen
            to file their own lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Gigantic Nightmare' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement will help the card companies rid themselves
            of a 'gigantic nightmare' in terms of legal fees and other
            costs, said Sarah Jane Hughes, a professor at Indiana University
            Bloomington's Maurer School of Law, who isn't involved in the
            litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard said it's confident the court will grant final
            approval. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The scope of the release is reasonable and logical,'
            Noah Hanft, the company's general counsel, said in a phone
            interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Cohen, a Visa spokesman, declined to comment about
            today's hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a joint court filing in April, lawyers for the card
            companies and major U.S. banks said the release 'covers only
            claims based on continued rules and practices that are the same
            as, or substantially similar to, those currently in place or
            modified by the settlement, which courts have held a class may
            properly release.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interchange fees are collected by Visa and MasterCard and
            turned over to banks, which use the funds to help cover the
            costs of issuing cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. began regulating debit-card interchange fees under
            the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
            2010. In July, a federal judge found those fees had been set too
            high and ordered the Federal Reserve to revisit the rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant
            Discount Antitrust Litigation, 05-md-01720, U.S. District Court,
            Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>TD-CIBC Reach Agreement With Aimia on Aerogold Visa</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
            agreed to sell about half its Aerogold Visa credit-card
            portfolio to Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), which is planning to start
            its own Aeroplan rewards card program in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial will receive about C$3 billion ($2.9
            billion) cash for the outstanding card balances, as well as an
            upfront payment of C$200 million from Toronto-Dominion and
            Aeroplan owner Aimia (AIM) Inc., Toronto-based CIBC said today in a
            statement. Toronto-Dominion also agreed to pay CIBC C$37.5
            million annually for three years, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies had been in talks since last month, when
            Toronto-Dominion was chosen as the primary card partner of
            Montreal-based loyalty-program operator Aimia. Toronto-Dominion
            will offer co-branded Aeroplan Visa cards that offer miles for
            flights and other rewards starting in January under a 10-year
            contract with Aimia, while CIBC keeps the right to offer
            Aeroplan cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion said in a separate statement that it will
            acquire 550,000 cardholder accounts, primarily those who don't
            have a banking relationship with Canadian Imperial. The
            agreement, expected to be completed in December, will add about
            10 cents a share to its adjusted earnings next year, and 15
            cents in 2015, Toronto-Dominion said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Aimia Contract &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the negative in the agreement is that TD will
            no longer be the sole Canadian bank issuing Aeroplan cards,'
            John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays Plc in Toronto, said in a
            note to clients. 'We do not believe this was the original
            vision when TD initially pursued the contract with Aimia.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion plans to introduce five Aeroplan Visa
            cards in Canada and the U.S., the lender said in a conference
            call. The three-way deal gives Toronto-Dominion Aeroplan
            cardholders from the outset of its new offering, allowing the
            lender to avoid starting from scratch and having to win over
            each cardholder individually, Chief Executive Officer Ed Clark
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's just dramatically lower risk, and so I'll always say
            a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,' Clark said in a
            telephone interview from Toronto. 'So we get an earnings base
            and we can spend vigorously on marketing to grow this file.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Renewal Option &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial will retain its Aerogold Visa cardholders
            that have 'deeper' banking relationships with the lender,
            David Williamson, group head of retail and business banking,
            said today in a conference call. The bank can continue to offer
            Aeroplan cards for 10 years, and may have the option to renew
            after that, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial rose 0.8 percent to close at C$81.74 in
            Toronto and Toronto-Dominion advanced 1.2 percent to C$91.02.
            Aimia surged 7.3 percent to C$17.85, the most since June 27. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While CIBC does not receive much of a premium on the
            cardholder balances, the accounts sold were the ones that were
            the highest risk of flight and receiving any value should be
            viewed as an incremental positive,' Aiken said. 'With the
            ability to continue to issue Aeroplan cards, CIBC should be able
            to more adequately defend the customers that it retained.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial will release about C$65 million of loan-loss provisions tied to the sold
            portfolio and have about C$55
            million in costs, the bank said. Net income of upfront payments,
            the loan-loss release and closing costs is expected to be about
            C$180 million. Annual earnings will be reduced by about 45 cents
            a share, Canadian Imperial said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Air Canada &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial's two-decade partnership with Aimia made
            the CIBC Aerogold Visa its most popular card. The bank buys
            Aeroplan miles from Aimia to give to cardholders on purchases,
            including flights with Air Canada (AC/B), the country's biggest
            carrier. Aimia, which owns and manages rewards programs
            including Nectar in the U.K. and Italy, counts CIBC as its
            biggest partner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aimia said in a separate statement that Toronto-Dominion
            becomes Aeroplan's primary financial-services partner and
            credit-card issuer, though CIBC will also continue to be an
            issuer of Aeroplan cards through 10-year agreements. CIBC will
            keep 630,000 Aeroplan accounts held by existing banking
            customers under the agreement, Aimia said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'CIBC has been an issuer of Aeroplan loyalty credit cards
            for more than 20 years, and this deal ensures that our clients
            will continue to have access to the program for the next 10
            years,' Canadian Imperial CEO Gerald McCaughey said on the
            conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aeroplan began in 1984 as a promotional tool for business
            travelers on Air Canada. CIBC Aerogold Visa was started in 1991,
            according to Aimia. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Visa to Create 2,000 Full-Time Jobs Amid Global Tech Push</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), the world's largest
            payments network, is creating 2,000 full-time jobs as the
            company expands teams in Singapore and the U.S. and opens a
            technology center in India. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The total includes new roles and existing contractor jobs
            that are being converted into full-time positions, the Foster
            City, California-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Recruitment efforts, which are currently under way and
            will continue through 2017, will focus on a range of technology
            needs spanning data scientists, engineers, platform architects
            and mobile developers,' the company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa plans to open a new technology-development center in
            India and is adding staff in Austin, Texas; Ashburn, Virginia;
            the San Francisco area and Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment 'allows us to strengthen our talent pool
            globally, and bring more of it in-house,' Rajat Taneja,
            executive vice president of technology, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company opened a new outpost in San Francisco in July.
            Visa has been expanding its digital and mobile products and
            services, and in July introduced Visa Checkout, which it said
            will allow consumers to make purchases faster online. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Apple Inc. said its new iPhones include
            a payment system that relies on card networks including Visa as
            well as banks. As part of the partnership, Visa offers bank
            clients a new service that replaces account information with a
            digital token. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Visa increases its investments in in-house capabilities,
            the firm is reducing its stake in other startups. Visa said
            Sept. 18 it was considering its options regarding an investment
            in Monitise Plc, a London-based mobile-payments firm. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) won a
            tentative court ruling they don't infringe a patent owned by
            SmartMetric Inc., a technology development company that seeks
            $13.4 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald issued his
            tentative ruling yesterday at a hearing in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't see there's anything to determine here for a
            jury,' the judge said at the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
            claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
            connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
            a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
            MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
            fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
            microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
            system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
            the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
            Patrick Bright, the company's lawyer, said at yesterday's
            hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bright said he should be allowed to take his evidence
            before a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You substituted the court as the trier of fact,' Bright
            told the judge. 'That is reversible error.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joseph Melnik, a lawyer for Visa, said at the hearing that
            the Visa and MasterCard systems do fundamentally different
            things than what's claimed by the patent. An earlier lawsuit
            brought by SmartMetric against the two companies resulted in a
            court ruling that there was no infringement, according to a Visa
            court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fitzgerald didn't issue a final ruling at the hearing and
            took the motion under submission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In dispute is patent 6,792,464, which was issued in
            September 2004. The patent suit was filed in August 2011. The
            case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central
            District of California
            (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Starbucks' Trademark Quest Points to Soda-Producing Machines &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), the Seattle-based coffee chain, filed an
            application to register a trademark that could be used for a
            home soda machine like those made by Israel's SodaStream
            International Ltd. (SODA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coffee company filed an application Sept. 18 to
            register the term 'Fizzio,' according to the database of the
            U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The application is for the term's use with a wide range of
            food and beverages, one of which is 'machines for the
            production of beverages.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The application also lists 'flavored and unflavored water;
            mineral water; sparkling water; soft drinks; fruit drinks; fruit
            juices; sparkling fruit and juice based beverages; soda
            beverages; frozen fruit beverages; frozen fruit-based
            beverages.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)'s Keurig unit
            filed an application to register a mark it said would be used
            with 'machines for the production of cold water, soda, still,
            carbonated and sparkling beverages.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The term Green Mountain is seeking to register is
            'Karbon.' At that same time, Waterbury, Vermont-based Green
            Mountain filed a second application to register 'Bolt' for use
            with carafes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of the selling points for SodaStream's product is that
            it cuts down on waste because customers will be using a
            refillable container to make sparking beverages, instead of
            buying soda in plastic bottles that need to be recycled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;SeaWorld Seeks Trademark on Name of Japanese Island, Horse Breed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS), the subject of a critical
            documentary over the use of killer whales in its theme parks,
            may be going in a new direction in efforts to combat an
            attendance slump. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Orlando, Florida-based company filed an application
            Sept. 19 to register the term 'Yonaguni' as a trademark,
            according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The term is to be used for the 'entertainment services in
            the nature of an animated television series for children,' the
            company said in its application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The application also covers the use of the term for the
            production of live-action and animated entertainment shows and
            interactive programs for distribution via audio and visual
            media, and electronic means, and for live performances by
            costumed characters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yonaguni is the name both of a breed of horse found on
            Japan's western islands, and the westernmost inhabited island in
            that chain. There is also a stone formation beneath the sea near
            that island that is known as the Yonaguni Monument, and is
            believed by some to be a sunken man-made structure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SeaWorld received negative publicity from 'Blackfish,'
            released in U.S. theaters on July 19, which began attracting
            attention after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in
            January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Blackfish' argues that killer whales shouldn't be held
            in captivity, and that the company ignored warning signs of the
            danger to handlers. SeaWorld has countered with a detailed
            critique of the film, calling it 'a dishonest movie' in a
            statement distributed to critics and refuting many of its
            conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is no higher priority for SeaWorld than the safety
            of guests and staff and the welfare of our animals,' the
            company said in a statement following the release of the film. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pho Holdings Backs Down in Trademark Claim Against Mo Pho &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Vietnamese restaurant in South London received a cease-and-desist letter from a restaurant chain
            accusing it of
            infringing a 'pho' trademark, the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pho is Vietnam's national dish and a staple at Vietnamese
            restaurants, according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pho Holdings Ltd., which sent the notice to the Mo Pho
            restaurant, said it had registered the mark six years earlier
            and no one else was entitled to use the word in a restaurant
            name, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has since changed course, saying it had made a
            mistake, wouldn't file a trademark infringement suit and hadn't
            meant to suggest that the trademark conveyed ownership of pho,
            according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Diamond Resorts Claims Diamond Resort Marketing Infringes Marks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diamond Resorts International Inc., the Las Vegas-based
            time-share vacation-property operator, sued a Virginia company
            that offers time-share marking services for trademark
            infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diamond Resort Marketing Services Inc. of Alexandria,
            Virginia, is accused of confusing the public by using marks that
            are similar to those belonging to the Las Vegas company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Sept. 24 in federal court
            in Newark, New Jersey, Diamond Resort Marketing also used an
            Internet domain name -- www.diamondresortms.com -- that is also
            causes the public to assume falsely that the two entities are
            affiliated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diamond Resort Marketing allegedly uses similar names to
            trade on the goodwill established by the Las Vegas company,
            according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diamond Resorts International asked the court for an order
            barring further use of the confusingly similar names, and asked
            that it be transferred the objectionable domain name. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company seeks money damages of at least
            $2 million per infringed trademark, and asked that they be
            tripled to punish the Virginia company for its actions, and for
            awards of litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suit also names Diamond Resort Marketing's Web-hosting
            service and a privacy protection service that replaces visible
            contact information for a domain name with alternative
            information, concealing the identity of the true owner of the
            domain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diamond Resort Marketing didn't respond to an e-mailed
            request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Diamond Resorts Holdings LLC v. Host Department
            LLC, 2:13-cv-05689-SDW-MCA, U.S. District Court, District of New
            Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bollywood-Style Weddings Need Copyright Protection, Planners Say &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's wedding industry, which is growing 25 percent a
            year, is in need of copyright protection, according to a meeting
            of wedding planners, Asian Age reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the 'Copyright of Wedding' conference, held in
            Guragon, India, wedding planners said the growing demand for
            'Bollywood-style' wedding film videos means months of costly
            preparation, and many planners say their ideas have been ripped
            off and credited to others often within less than a week,
            according to Asian Age. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Menezes of the Showtime Group wedding organizers
            told the conference that protecting his work is difficult
            because intellectual property rights presently don't exist in
            the field, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the conference attorney Umesh Sharma said when someone
            is accused of infringement in this category, offenders often
            manage to walk out of court with no more than a warning,
            according to Asian Age. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Largan Seeks Seizure of Ability's Assets in Trade Secret Fight &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Largan Precision Co. (3008), a Taiwanese maker of lenses for
            handset cameras, has asked a court in Taiwan to seize a
            competitor's working capital, liquid assets and production
            equipment under claims the competitor stole its trade secrets,
            the China Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ability Opto-Electronics Technology Co. (3362) is accused of
            applying for two patents based on technology brought to the
            company by four defecting Largan engineers without
            authorization, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tauchung Hsien, Taiwan-based Ability has denied all
            allegations and said it will file a countersuit, China Post
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Largan and Ability are already engaged in a patent-infringement case that began in June, according
            to China Post. &lt;/p&gt;
