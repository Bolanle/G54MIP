        <headline>Pfizer Makes Nanomedicines Deal With Bind Therapeutics</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, will pay closely held Bind Therapeutics Inc. as much
            as $200 million per potential drug to develop medicines using
            its nanotechnology platform. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies will collaborate on preclinical work and New
            York-based Pfizer will have the option to pursue development of
            compounds it selects, Bind said in a statement today. The
            Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company may receive as much as
            $50 million in upfront and development payments and is eligible
            for $160 million more per compound tied to regulatory and sales
            goals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal is the second this year for Bind, which uses
            nanotechnology to selectively reach disease sites in the body in
            treating cancer, inflammatory ailments and cardiovascular
            disorders without affecting healthy tissue. In January, Amgen
            Inc. said it would pay as much as $180.5 million for the right
            to develop cancer drugs using Bind's technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The pharmaceutical industry is reaching an inflection
            point in terms of adopting this as a major strategic technology
            for the industry,' Bind Chief Executive Officer Scott Minick
            said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bind's technology comes from the laboratories of Robert
            Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Omid Farokhzad, of Harvard Medical School. Its
            nanoparticles, which
            it calls Accurins, can travel through the body without being
            detected or destroyed by the immune system, Minick said.
            Carrying potent drugs, the particles home in on specific disease
            cells and avoid poisoning healthy ones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Results Expected &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to partnerships with Pfizer and Thousand Oaks,
            California-based Amgen, Bind is developing a slate of potential
            drugs in-house. The company's leading therapy is BIND-014, which
            targets tumors with the cancer drug docetaxel. Bind said last
            week it will present results from a first-stage study of the
            treatment at the American Association for Cancer Research
            meeting on April 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer 'partnered with Bind because these delivery systems
            are a unique approach that potentially offer highly precise
            targeted therapeutics increasing the window for broader patient
            treatment options,' said Lauren Starr, a spokeswoman for the
            drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $29.03 at the close
            in New York. The shares have increased 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Read Finds Reason to Keep Consumer Health Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) plans to keep its $3.2
            billion-a-year consumer health business because the unit will be
            critical to selling prescription drugs that become over-the-
            counter products, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit that makes ChapStick lip balm, Advil pain pills
            and Centrum vitamins will 'absolutely' stay within New York-
            based Pfizer, Read told investors on a conference call arranged
            by Sanford C. Bernstein Co. last week. Medicines shifting to
            nonprescription status will be a growing trend, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a business that has a great store of value for us,'
            Read said on the March 26 call. A recording of the call was
            posted online. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, has been shrinking
            since Read took over in late 2010, cutting expenses and
            divesting its animal health and infant nutrition units. The CEO
            has talked about splitting the drug business in two, with one
            unit focusing on brand-name medicines and another on those that
            don't have patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer does still very much seem to be contemplating this
            possibility, but no firm decision has been made yet,' said Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst, said in a note
            to clients after
            the call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drugmaker's shares rose less than 1 percent to close at
            $29.16 in New York. The stock had gained 30 percent in the last
            12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consumer business is headed by Amy Schulman, who also
            serves as general counsel and ran the infant nutrition business
            until it was sold to Nestle SA (NESN) last year for $11.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Unlock Value &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I do see the synergies with the branded and the generics
            part of the business -- much more so than existed with animal
            health or with nutritionals,' said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst
            at New York-based International Strategy Investment Group Inc.
            said in e-mail. Still, 'a separation could unlock a bit of
            value.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If Pfizer chooses to split the company in two, the consumer
            unit might be bundled with its generic-drug business, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been trying to expand the consumer line. In
            August, the company bought the rights to sell AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)'s
            heartburn pill Nexium over the counter. Pfizer paid $250 million
            up front, and will pay royalties once the drug goes on sale,
            likely in the U.S. about 2014. The company has also said it may
            try and develop a nonprescription version of the cholesterol
            pill Lipitor, which was once Pfizer's best-selling product. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Comfortable Fit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It in many ways has a very comfortable fit within our
            current platform,' Schulman said on the investor call. 'It's
            also an important harbinger of where the market is going.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In emerging markets, prescription drugs will be more
            readily available over the counter than they will be in the
            U.S., Read predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You could potentially see emerging markets moving faster
            on this OTC switch than the very cautious' U.S. Food and Drug
            Administration, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Drugmaker Merck Co. (MRK) is evaluating its consumer unit
            because it may not be big enough, Merck CEO Ken Frazier said at
            a January investor conference. The Whitehouse Station, New
            Jersey-based company got $1.95 billion in sales from the
            business last year, with more than a quarter of that coming from
            allergy medicine Claritin OTC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schulman said that Pfizer's business, which is larger than
            Merck's, has enough depth in the products and geographies in
            which it chooses to sell. 'I think we have scale in the areas
            in which we compete,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Neurontin Class Improperly Denied, Court Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may have to face
            lawsuits by insurers alleging the company improperly marketed
            the epilepsy drug Neurontin after an appeals court found the
            cases were improperly denied class-action status. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston yesterday found a
            lower-court judge erred in refusing to allow so-called 'third-
            party payers,' such as health insurers and union funds, to
            combine their Neurontin racketeering claims. The appeals court
            also upheld a $142.1 million damage award to Kaiser Foundation
            Health Plan Inc. over Pfizer's Neurontin marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We reject the argument' that Kaiser's lawyers didn't
            produce sufficient evidence to uphold the jury verdict, the
            court said in a 64-page ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision allows hundreds of U.S. health plans to revive
            potential class-action racketeering claims that the world's
            largest drugmaker engaged in illegal off-label marketing of
            Neurontin for bipolar disorders, said Carl Tobias, who teaches
            product-liability law at the University of Richmond in Virginia.
            'They are telling the judge to take another look at the class-
            certification issue,' Tobias said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials said they are considering appealing the
            today's rulings in the Neurontin cases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'No Basis' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer continues to believe there was no basis in fact or
            law' for the Kaiser verdict, Chris Loder, a spokesman for the
            New York-based company, said in an e-mailed statement. The
            drugmaker also contends the trial judge correctly ruled the
            insurers shouldn't be able to proceed as a class with their
            claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer and its Warner-Lambert unit are accused in the
            insurers' lawsuits of promoting the drug for uses that weren't
            approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to boost
            profit. The insurers contend they were duped into covering
            Neurontin prescriptions for unapproved ailments, such as bipolar
            disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004
            to criminal charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department and
            paid $430 million to resolve allegations over the company's
            Neurontin marketing. Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert for $120
            billion in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Neurontin's sales rose from 15 percent off-label in 1994 to
            94 percent in 2002, the government said in court filings. The
            drug's sales hit $2.3 billion in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Combine Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurers sought to combine claims that Pfizer engaged
            in racketeering through its Neurontin marketing. U.S. District
            Judge Patti Saris denied that request, ruling the plans couldn't
            show Pfizer's actions caused their damages and therefore weren't
            entitled to have a class-action case certified, according to
            court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeals court panel, which included retired Supreme
            Court Judge David Souter, concluded the plans presented
            sufficient evidence to show Pfizer's illegal Neurontin marketing
            caused the insurers' damages. The panel sent the case back to
            Saris to revive the racketeering claims and to reexamine whether
            the cases should be certified as a class action. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We express no view as to whether the plaintiffs can, on
            remand, meet the requirements' for having their cases combined,
            the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the Kaiser case, a federal court jury in Boston
            concluded in 2010 Pfizer violated federal racketeering laws
            through its Neurontin marketing and it awarded $47.4 million in
            damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saris later tripled the award under a provision of the
            racketeering statutes. The claims were brought by the Kaiser
            Foundation plan and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals. Both are units
            of Oakland, California-based insurer Kaiser Permanente. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are In RE Neurontin Marketing and Sales Practices
            Litigation, 11-1806, 11-1904 and 11-2096, United States Court of
            Appeals for the First Circuit (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer, Lilly Breast Cancer Drugs Slow Tumors in Studies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Experimental breast cancer drugs from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Eli Lilly Co. (LLY) slowed or halted
            growth of advanced tumors in studies, potentially adding a new treatment option for patients and top-selling
            therapies for the companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's palbociclib doubled to 20.2 months the time in
            which patients' advanced breast cancer didn't progress, the drugmaker said today. In an unrelated study,
            Lilly's drug, bemaciclib, aided 61 percent of patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer,
            meaning the size of their tumors shrunk by 30 percent or didn't increase for 24 weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors
            and investors have been awaiting results for the medicines, part of a class called cyclin-dependent kinase
            4/6 inhibitors. The therapies offer a new treatment avenue for about 80 percent of patients whose breast
            tumors are hormone receptor-positive. Palbociclib is projected to sell $3.11 billion in 2020 as it expands
            to fight other cancers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We took a new drug and asked how it works in a specific set of
            breast cancers based on science,' said Richard Finn, an associate professor at the University of California
            at Los Angeles's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and co-principal investigator of Pfizer's study. 'This
            is really the type of benefit we're aiming for, and it's the type of benefit that results from a rational
            development program.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer CEO Was Highest Paid Among Pharma Companies Last Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s Ian Read was the
            highest-paid chief executive officer at a large pharmaceutical
            company last year, as U.S. top managers remained on average much
            better paid than their European counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer increased Read's remuneration 2.5
            percent to $25.6 million in 2012, while Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB)'s Lars Rebien Soerensen was the lowest-paid
            CEO, with $5 million, Sam Fazeli, a London-based analyst for Bloomberg Industries, wrote
            in a note today. The median pay of CEOs leading large
            pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. was $17.2 million last
            year, 85 percent more than the $9.3 million European average,
            according to the analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Payments to top managers in Europe, even though lower than
            in the U.S., remain under scrutiny. A U.K. pension group has
            recommended that members vote against London-based AstraZeneca
            Plc (AZN)'s remuneration policy at the company's annual general
            meeting on April 25 to protest a 'golden hello' payment and
            planned incentives for Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG (NOVN) met similar investor
            pressure earlier this year because of its plans to pay outgoing
            Chairman Daniel Vasella $77 million as part of a non-compete
            agreement. Vasella's 'golden parachute' came to light after
            details were leaked to the press, leading to a public outcry in
            Switzerland and prompting him to give up the money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Large-cap pharmaceutical companies paid their CEOs a median
            of $13.7 million in 2012, well below the industrials-company
            median of $21.9 million, according to Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Said to Have Held Talks to Acquire AstraZeneca</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, held informal, now-discontinued talks with
            AstraZeneca Plc about buying the London-based maker of asthma
            and heart drugs, said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies aren't currently negotiating, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified. One said the talks
            happened several months ago and there are no plans to resume.
            The discussions were first reported yesterday by London's Sunday
            Times, whose unnamed bank and industry sources said New York-based Pfizer made a tentative approach about a
            takeover valuing
            AstraZeneca at more than 60 billion pounds ($101 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If revived, such an acquisition would be among the largest
            ever in the industry. Pfizer has reorganized its business over
            the past three years, shuttering some research projects and
            emphasizing others. A deal with AstraZeneca (AZN) would add early-stage drugs in a field of cancer
            treatments that use the body's
            own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't comment on market speculation or rumors,' said
            Andrew Topen, a Pfizer spokesman, in an e-mail. Esra Erkal-Paler, am AstraZeneca spokeswoman, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts for AstraZeneca gained 8.8
            percent to $69.10 at 4 p.m. New York time. Pfizer rose 2 percent
            to $30.86. The stock has increased about 37 percent in the last
            two years as Pfizer benefited from the revamping that focused it
            into three units: two for new drugs, and one for older products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;AstraZeneca Treatments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca in January announced an agreement with
            Immunocore Limited to develop the new cancer treatments that use
            the body's own immune cells, and it also has several of its own
            immune-based drugs being tested in multiple cancers. The
            company's shares in London have risen about 34 percent over two
            years, even as sales have fallen from $33.6 billion in 2011 to
            $25.7 billion last year, with further losses projected by some
            analysts as drugs lose patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While a deal would be highly accretive through cost
            cutting, Pfizer shareholders may have doubts about AstraZeneca's
            pipeline as well as its eroding revenue, said Mark Schoenebaum,
            an analyst with ISI Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The consensus AstraZeneca model is hugely dependent on
            pipeline assumptions, as the base business will deteriorate
            massively by 2020 as several key products go off patent,' he
            said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mega-Mergers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A merger of this reported size would top Pfizer's 2000
            purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. for $87 billion, the industry's
            largest deal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer
            has been at the center of the biggest drugmaker mega-mergers,
            making up three of the 10 deals worth more than $30 billion in
            the last two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It would also provide a use for Pfizer's cash from profits
            that have been stashed overseas instead of being brought back to
            the U.S., where they would be taxed at a higher rate. Pfizer had
            $69 billion in untaxed cash overseas as of last month, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A purchase of AstraZeneca could also potentially allow
            Pfizer to move its tax domicile to the U.K. through a so-called
            inversion transaction, a move that has allowed other U.S.
            drugmakers to lower their tax bill. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shares in London rose 0.6 percent to close at
            3,781.50 pence on April 17, giving the company a market value of
            47.7 billion pounds. The London stock market was closed for a
            holiday April 18 and today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Merger Comments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since taking over in 2010, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer
            Ian Read's answers to whether or not he would pursue a mega-merger such as a deal with AstraZeneca have
            shifted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On a January conference call in 2012 he said, 'I'm very
            disinclined to be looking at any possibility of another mega-acquisition. You never say never, but we have
            all of the science
            we need.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July 2013, when Read was asked on another conference
            call about the size of deals he might pursue, he replied:
            'We'll look at any type of acquisition -- never say never to a
            larger acquisition that made sense.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schoenebaum said there were signs Pfizer could pursue a
            large target. 'Pfizer has been signaling since last summer
            that, in theory, the company would not be opposed to a larger
            MA deal if the numbers made sense,' Schoenebaum said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nestle, Aereo, Pfizer, Momenta: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN) offered to lift obstacles
            to rivals that make knockoff capsules for Nespresso coffee
            machines in France, aiming to end a probe by the competition
            regulator in the largest market for the iconic brand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest coffee maker proposed giving
            competitors three months' notice about technical changes to its
            machines and promised it won't discourage consumers against
            copycats or automatically revoke warranties on Nespresso
            machines if compatible capsules are used, according to a
            statement April 17 from the French Competition Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling 'was the first of its kind,' Alain-Sebastian
            Oberhuber, an analyst at MainFirst, said in a note. 'Nestle
            faces the risk of more such antitrust investigations in other
            markets,' which could hurt sales and profit, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nespresso, the biggest maker of single-serve coffee in
            Europe, has been losing market share to capsules made by
            companies including D.E Master Blenders 1753, Mondelez
            International Inc. (MDLZ) and Ethical Coffee Co. as some of its patents
            have expired. Nespresso has been adding espresso varieties and
            expanding into areas like the U.S. to boost sales as growth has
            slowed in past years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The initiatives 'demonstrate the company's commitment to
            fair and open competition,' Diane Duperret, a Nespresso
            spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Diller Goes Big in U.S. High Court Gamble on Aereo's Future &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From the moment billionaire media mogul Barry Diller joined
            the board of Aereo Inc. in 2012, he had a date with the U.S.
            Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aereo, the streaming-TV startup challenging the economics
            of the television industry, goes before the court tomorrow to
            fight copyright claims from broadcasters including CBS Corp. (CBS) and
            Walt Disney Co. (DIS)'s ABC. Aereo's Internet service lets customers
            in 11 cities watch live and recorded broadcast programs for $8 a
            month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case marks the culmination of a two-year court fight
            stemming from Aereo's bid to forge a technological route around
            the broadcasters' copyrights and from Diller's hope to transform
            an industry he once embodied. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Broadcasters say an Aereo victory might create a blueprint
            that would let cable and satellite providers stop paying
            billions of dollars in retransmission fees each year to carry
            local programming. While Aereo questions that assessment, Diller
            says his goal is nothing short of upending the TV distribution
            system so consumers can buy programming they want, rather than
            the packages offered through cable and satellite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the Supreme Court now set to rule by early July, the
            broadcasters say they are confident the gamble will fail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chances for a definitive ruling rose last week when Justice
            Samuel Alito indicated he will take part. Alito didn't
            participate when the court agreed in January to hear the
            dispute, raising the prospect that the court might divide 4-4.
            The court's online docket on April 17 said Alito is 'no longer
            recused' from the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo,
            13-461. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Pandora Sued by Record Companies Over Music Made Before 1972 &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora Media Inc., (P) the biggest Internet radio service, was
            sued by major record labels for failing to pay for using music
            recorded before 1972. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies, including Capitol Records LLC and Sony Music
            Entertainment, filed the copyright-infringement lawsuit in New
            York State Supreme Court in Manhattan April 17 because federal
            law doesn't protect recordings made before Feb. 15, 1972. New
            York courts have enforced ownership rights stemming from before
            that date, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The labels accused the Oakland, California-based music
            streaming service of 'massive and continuing unauthorized
            commercial exploitation' of thousands of recordings including
            iconic songs such as the Beatles' 'Hey Jude,' Bob Dylan's
            'Like a Rolling Stone' and Marvin Gaye's 'I Heard It Through
            the Grapevine.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora has been fighting in court over how much it has to
            pay to stream music. In a ruling that sets a precedent for
            future rate battles, a federal judge in Manhattan last month
            said the company must give 1.85 percent of revenue to a group
            representing songwriters and music publishers, rejecting
            Pandora's request for a lower rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pandora is confident in its legal position and looks
            forward to a quick resolution of this matter,' Will Valentine,
            a spokesman for the company, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora had sued the 470,000-member American Society of
            Composers, Authors and Publishers in 2012, saying that the fees
            charged at the time made sustained profitability impossible. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint follows a similar suit filed last year
            against New York-based Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (SIRI) in state court in
            California. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Capitol Records LLC v. Pandora Media Inc.,
            651195/2014, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Patent &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Teva Rejected by Justice Roberts on Generic Copaxone Delay &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A U.S. Supreme Court justice rejected Teva Pharmaceutical
            Industries Ltd. (TEVA)'s bid to block generic versions of its Copaxone
            multiple-sclerosis drug while the court hears the company's
            appeal in a patent clash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rebuff by Chief Justice John Roberts on April 18 leaves
            Teva open to generic competition as soon as next month. Mylan
            Inc., Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA) and Novartis AG's Sandoz are
            positioned to start selling generic Copaxone in late May,
            although they would risk having to pay damages if Teva
            ultimately wins its patent-infringement case. Momenta and Sandoz
            are working together on a generic version of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Teva will continue pursuing its appeal in the Supreme
            Court and defending its intellectual property for Copaxone,'
            according to a statement April 19 from the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva can ask another justice to intervene. By custom, that
            application would then go to the full court for consideration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a one-paragraph opinion April 18, Roberts said a court-ordered delay was unnecessary because
            Teva could recover damages
            for infringement if it wins the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased with the chief justice's decision, and we
            look forward to introducing the first generic Copaxone treatment
            for multiple sclerosis patients in the U.S. at market
            formation,' Mylan Chief Executive Officer Heather Bresch said
            in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copaxone brings in $3.2 billion in annual U.S. sales and
            accounts for more than half of Teva's profit. A delay would give
            Teva more time to switch patients from the 20-milligram dose
            that is the subject of the legal fight to a 40-milligram dose it
            says is covered by other patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Teva v. Sandoz, 13-854. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AstraZeneca Rises on Reported Talks With Pfizer Over Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) rose the most in
            more than three years after reports over the weekend that Pfizer
            Inc. (PFE) discussed acquiring the London-based drugmaker in informal,
            now-discontinued talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca climbed 8 percent to 4,085.5 pence at 8:06 a.m.
            in London. The intraday increase of as much as 8.5 percent was
            the biggest since June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer and AstraZeneca aren't currently negotiating, said
            two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be
            identified. One said the talks happened several months ago and
            there are no plans to resume. The discussions were first
            reported April 20 by London's Sunday Times, which said New York-based Pfizer made a tentative approach about
            a takeover valuing
            AstraZeneca at more than 60 billion pounds ($101 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If revived, such an acquisition would be among the largest
            ever in the industry. Pfizer has reorganized its business over
            the past three years, shuttering some research projects and
            emphasizing others. A deal with AstraZeneca would add early-stage drugs in a field of cancer treatments that
            use the body's
            own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer and AstraZeneca both declined to comment.
            Separately, Novartis AG said today it agreed to buy
            GlaxoSmithKline Plc's cancer-drug business for as much as $16
            billion, form a consumer-health venture with Glaxo and sell its
            animal-health operation to Eli Lilly Co. for $5.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Large deals make sense for Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), even if not with each
            other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the talks between Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, and $87 billion
            AstraZeneca have fizzled, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. expects Pfizer to approach the company again, or
            AstraZeneca could opt to merge with another peer such as Amgen Inc. (AMGN) as a defense tactic. Pfizer's
            backup plan could be to acquire Dublin-based Shire Plc, Albert Fried Co. said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both
            companies face stalling growth over the next few years, with Pfizer needing new products to replace drugs
            that lost patent protection and AstraZeneca's promising cancer treatments still years from hitting the
            market. At the same time, smaller rivals are scooping up assets and building their presence as drug
            takeovers surged to a five-year high, led by Actavis Plc's $21 billion bid for Forest Laboratories Inc.,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody's scrambling for these assets,' Sachin Shah, a special situations and merger arbitrage
            strategist at Albert Fried in New York, said in a phone interview. 'When you have these large transactions
            back to back to back, it just begs the question of what do the big pharma guys think about this? Right now,
            Pfizer's probably coming to the conclusion that it needs to have a 'buy' mentality.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Arthritis Drug Rejected by European Regulators</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s rheumatoid arthritis
            pill failed to win the backing of European drug regulators, who
            said the drug already approved in the U.S. isn't effective
            enough against the condition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal
            Products for Human Use, or CHMP, recommended that Pfizer's pill
            Xeljanz not be approved for sale, the New York-based drugmaker
            said today in a statement. The drug gained marketing clearance
            in the U.S. in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer intends to appeal this opinion and immediately
            seek a re-examination of the opinion by the CHMP,' the company
            said. The committee decided the drug didn't show a favorable
            risk versus benefit profile, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Xeljanz inhibits part of the immune system that can cause
            rheumatoid arthritis. The first of a new type of therapies for
            the disease, the pill is one of Pfizer's top new products. If
            approved in Europe, it may generate sales of $510 million there
            by 2018, according to Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with
            International Strategy Investment Group in New York. The
            medicine would compete with AbbVie Inc.'s Humira (ABBV) and Johnson
            Johnson (JNJ)'s Remicade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer will appeal, but history teaches that odds are
            against them,' Schoenebaum said today in a note to clients.
            More data might help Pfizer on appeal, which may take six
            months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Comittee's View &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European regulators said the drug didn't show enough
            effectiveness in reducing the disease's activity in the body or
            slowing damage to joints, even though it improved symptoms,
            Pfizer said. There were also concerns about side effects
            including tumors and infections. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission usually adopts the committee's
            advice, though it isn't required to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares declined 2.4 percent to $29.53 in extended
            trading at 5:50 p.m. New York time after the announcement. The
            shares closed at $30.26 today and have gained 32 percent in the
            past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Treasury Seen Loser in Tax-Avoiding Pfizer Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;If Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is successful in its
            $98.7 billion takeover of London-based AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), there is
            one big potential loser: the U.S. Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the proposed deal's structure, the combined company
            would be owned by a new U.K. parent. That doesn't mean any of
            New York-based Pfizer's executives would need to move abroad:
            Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has said the drugmaker would be
            run from the U.S. It does mean, however, that Pfizer is joining
            a wave of U.S. companies using mergers as ways to slash income
            tax bills by shifting their head office overseas -- often on
            paper only. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is basically an opportunity to go outside the U.S.
            and still sell in the U.S. and strip the tax base,' said H.
            David Rosenbloom, an attorney at Caplin Drysdale in Washington
            and director of the international tax program at New York
            University's school of law. 'If we ever had a legislature in
            the United States, we could do something about this, but I don't
            expect to live that long.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. law seeks to stop companies from avoiding income taxes
            by simply ditching their home residence. Those rules only
            prevent companies from getting the tax benefit of an overseas
            merger if their existing shareholders still own 80 percent or
            more of the company's stock after the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            Ian Read, chief executive officer of Pfizer Inc., said 'it's in my future responsibility to maximum return
            to shareholders, and I don't actually see that is a conflict of with the interest of the U.S. government.'

            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is back in the megamerger game. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. drugmaker proposed
            buying AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) for about 58.8 billion pounds ($98.7 billion) in what would rank as the
            industry's biggest-ever takeover, surpassing Pfizer's $64 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. AstraZeneca
            spurned the offer as too low, and Pfizer said it's considering its options. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If
            AstraZeneca eventually agrees, a deal would create a company incorporated in the U.K. for tax purposes and
            run from New York. London-based AstraZeneca's operations would be sewn into Pfizer's three new business
            units. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer offered 46.61 pounds a share in cash and stock for AstraZeneca in January, and AstraZeneca
            declined to pursue negotiations, Pfizer said in a statement today. The proposal is about 14 percent above
            the April 25 close for AstraZeneca. The stock today climbed above that price, gaining the most in more than
            two decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, Pfizer is still trying to draw AstraZeneca into talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We tried to get a mutual announcement to say we were in preliminary discussions,' Pfizer Chief
            Executive Officer Ian Read said on a conference call today. 'AstraZeneca rebuffed that, which is why we were
            forced to make the announcement.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Bid May Have Been Invited by U.K.'s Tax Policy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. may have opened the door
            for Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s $98.7 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the
            country's second-biggest drugmaker, with a tax policy designed
            to draw research investment from abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the U.K. tightened takeover rules following Kraft
            Foods Inc.'s hostile bid for candy maker Cadbury Plc, the
            country has created incentives for drugmakers to increase
            research and capital investments. A program implemented last
            year enables companies to apply a lower corporate tax rate to
            profits from patents. That encouraged GlaxoSmithKline Plc,
            AstraZeneca's larger British rival, to build its first U.K.
            factory in almost four decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Britain would lose AstraZeneca if Pfizer pulls off
            the biggest-ever U.K. takeover, the nation would become the
            domicile of the world's biggest pharmaceutical company and
            receive a $100 billion boost to its economy, Pfizer Chief
            Executive Officer Ian Read said on a conference call with
            reporters yesterday. A spokesman for U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said there were rules in place
            governing acquisitions,
            and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If Pfizer incorporate in the U.K., you're bringing in
            inward investment,' said Dan Mahony, who helps manage about $12
            billion at Polar Capital Holdings Plc in London. 'You could
            argue that government policy has driven that, in which case,
            they're hardly going to try to nix the deal.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;U.S. companies looking for lower tax bills are heading for the exits, and Congress is doing nothing
            to stop them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) is the latest corporation to consider reducing its tax
            bill by moving its legal address outside the U.S., proposing an acquisition of London-based AstraZeneca Plc
            (AZN) that would allow Pfizer to reincorporate in the U.K. while top executives remain in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer would join at least 19 other companies making or contemplating similar transactions,
            including Chiquita Brands International Inc. (CQB) and Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC), the largest U.S.
            advertising firm. A stalled proposal from President Barack Obama to limit such deals would raise $17 billion
            over a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have responded with little outrage and no plans for a
            quick law to limit the transactions, known as inversions. Instead, they cite the deals as fuel for a revamp
            of the tax code that's probably years away. That inaction gives companies a window to look for offshore
            mergers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Members of Congress are not swayed as easily nowadays by all the rhetoric
            about corporate tax cheats and companies being traitors because they're moving to Ireland,' said Herman
            Bouma, a Washington-based senior tax counsel at Buchanan, Ingersoll Rooney P.C. 'There doesn't seem to be
            that many members upset about the inversions happening. They're more upset about the way their tax code is,
            that causes companies to want to do that.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;For three years, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief
            Executive Officer Ian Read has been firing people, trimming
            research initiatives and shedding businesses in a less-is-more
            strategy designed to cut back the excesses from a decade of
            megamergers. No more. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday's announcement that Pfizer is seeking to buy
            AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) in a new $100 billion megamerger is putting the
            industry on notice that a company that was once the world's
            biggest drugmaker is seeking to quickly reclaim its title. A
            consummated deal would generate more than $75 billion in
            combined yearly revenue, based on current sales. It may also
            offer new growth opportunities and tax advantages for Pfizer,
            and reopen a door on a promising family of cancer medications. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There are 'palatable aspects' to the deal, said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C.
            Bernstein Co., in a note
            to clients. Yet 'doing yet another big merger can certainly be
            viewed as a potential failure of sorts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's offer, quickly rebuffed by AstraZeneca as too low,
            was revealed after a pair of experimental drugs thought to have
            billion-dollar potential for Pfizer, Eliquis and Xeljanz,
            fizzled in their starts and a third, the breast cancer treatment
            palbociclib, will soon face a potent competitor in Eli Lilly
            Co.'s experimental drug bemaciclib. &lt;/p&gt;

            Corp. (DRRX), partners with Pfizer Inc. (PFE) on the medicine Remoxy,
            increased in New York trading after the world's biggest
            drugmaker highlighted the experimental painkiller's future on a
            conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics surged 26 percent to $4.12 at the close
            for the biggest one-day climb since November 2005. Durect rose
            26 percent to $1.57 for its largest single-day gain since March
            2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Remoxy is an extended-release oxycodone capsule for pain,
            formulated to limit abuse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
            postponed approval of the medicine in June 2011, after a delay
            in 2008 when the regulators asked for more laboratory data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For Remoxy, we had a productive meeting with the FDA in
            March and the guidance that we got out of that meeting is
            certainly helping to inform the next steps,' John Young, head
            of New York-based Pfizer's primary care unit, said on a call
            today with analysts and investors. 'We believe we have a path
            forward and we will publicly communicate further details over
            coming quarters.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer gained the drug in its $3.3 billion acquisition of
            King Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Austin, Texas-based Pain
            Therapeutics and Durect, in Cupertino, California, helped
            develop the therapy and would get royalties on sales. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, reduced its 2013 profit forecast after first-quarter
            sales missed analyst estimates. The shares had their worst one-
            day loss since August 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Full-year earnings excluding one-time items may be $2.14 to
            $2.24 a share as foreign currency rates weigh on results, New
            York-based Pfizer said today in a statement. The forecast cuts
            by 6 cents the range provided by the company in January. First-
            quarter net income surged 53 percent to $2.75 billion, or 38
            cents a share, from $1.79 billion, or 24 cents, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales for the pneumococcal vaccines Prevnar and the
            erectile dysfunction drug Viagra were less than analyst
            estimates, leading total revenue to fall about $440 million
            short of expectations, at $13.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It was 'clearly not a great quarter,' said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with International Strategy
            Investment
            Group in New York, in a note to clients today. 'However, it
            appears that the company will attribute a large portion of the
            miss, but not all, to one-time factors such as U.S. buying
            patterns and foreign exchange.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 4.5 percent to $29.07 at the close in
            New York. The stock has gained 27 percent in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Reviewing Idea of Potential Split, CFO Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, will analyze over the next eight months whether it
            will split itself into brand name and generics businesses, Chief
            Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer hasn't made a final decision on whether to break up
            the New York-based company and an official divide wouldn't
            happen until at least 2016, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
            said today. In the meantime, Pfizer is working to figure out
            whether its emerging markets operations would benefit from being
            organized more like its business in the U.S., Europe and Japan
            where the company has distinct brand and generics units,
            D'Amelio said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This 'is a study year,' D'Amelio said. 'What we don't
            want to do is take the positive out of what the model's already
            generating.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Talk of a possible split has dominated company conference
            calls with analysts since Read floated the idea last year. Such
            a break up is 'perhaps the last big lever management has left
            to pull,' Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
            Co., said before Pfizer earlier today announced its first-
            quarter earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;D'Amelio said feedback hasn't been unanimous, or final.
            'If you talk to investors, I think you'll get mixed comments,'
            he said. 'There's never a subject where I think the investment
            community is all-in one way or the other.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lipitor Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer has been working to remake itself after it lost
            exclusive sales rights in 2011 to Lipitor, the cholesterol
            treatment that was once the world's top-selling medicine with
            almost $13 billion. The company won U.S. marketing approval in
            the past six months for two new potential blockbusters, the
            rheumatoid arthritis pill Xeljanz and the blood thinner Eliquis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Pfizer reduced its forecast for 2013 profit
            excluding certain items after first-quarter sales missed
            analysts' estimates. Pfizer shares fell 4.5 percent to $29.07 at
            the close in New York, their worst one-day loss since August
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judson Clark, an analyst Edward Jones Co. who has a buy
            rating on the stock, said he's neutral on the idea of a split. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's almost a one-time resetting,' Clark said. 'I can't
            imagine every five or 10 years they're going to spin off their
            drugs that are in life-cycle management. I don't know if this is
            a recurring way to create shareholder value.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The key decision is whether the brand-name and generics
            businesses can exist inside Pfizer separately and still create
            value, or whether a formal split is necessary, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The first order of business is to find a way we can
            separate them and give the management as much authority and
            independence as necessary,' Read said today on a conference
            call. 'I believe it's worth creating that separation
            internally, because I believe it creates focus and management
            focus and improves the performance of those two businesses.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Lawmakers Seek Ways to Challenge Pfizer Move on AstraZeneca</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;British lawmakers mobilized against
            Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s attempt to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), demanding Business
            Secretary Vince Cable secure assurances on jobs and research
            investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adrian Bailey, chairman of Parliament's cross-party
            Business Committee, said April 29 it is likely to summon Pfizer
            executives to give evidence on their intentions. Yesterday,
            Julian Huppert, from Cable's junior coalition Liberal Democrat
            Party, submitted a motion calling for ministers to 'act as
            necessary to protect employment and skills in the U.K.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron has in the past praised
            Britain's open economy, suggesting he would be reluctant to
            intervene in the proposed $99 billion deal. Still, the
            government has mechanisms by which it could try to prevent a
            takeover. Pressure from Parliament and Liberal Democrats in the
            government could make that more likely. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a great deal at stake here,' Huppert said in a
            statement. 'This would be the largest takeover of a British
            firm. I want to make sure AstraZeneca retains its position in
            the U.K. It is extremely important for those people employed by
            the company and our economy generally.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read met with U.K.
            government ministers April 29 to discuss a potential takeover,
            according to a person familiar with the meetings. Read
            emphasized the American company's plans to carry out research,
            development and manufacturing in the U.K. as well as the appeal
            of the British tax system, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sun Pharmaceutical Profit Surges Before Pfizer Settlement Charge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP),
            India's biggest drugmaker by market value, posted a 56 percent
            increase in profit before a one-time charge as sales of its
            generic drugs in the U.S. climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Profit before a one-time payment to settle a patent
            litigation with Pfizer Inc. was 12.41 billion rupees (204.8
            million) in the quarter ended June, compared with 7.96 billion
            rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based Sun said in a statement
            today. The group reported a loss of 12.8 billion rupees during
            the period, compared with a median estimate for a profit of 10.3
            billion rupees in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you exclude the one-time payment, which was known to
            the market, the sales, margins and profits have all beaten our
            estimates,' said Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at Centrum Broking
            Pvt. 'We expect the stocks to rally about 5 percent' on Aug.
            12. Centrum will maintain its buy rating on the stock and revise
            the target price of 628 rupees, Kapadia said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sun, controlled by billionaire Dilip Shanghvi, paid 25.2
            billion rupees to Pfizer (PFE) to settle the litigation over sales of
            heartburn drug Protonix, the company said. Sun agreed in June to
            pay $550 million as settlement, compared with the $100 million
            it had set aside for the damages. Sun and Teva Pharmaceutical
            Industries Ltd. will together pay $2.15 billion to Pfizer and a
            partner to settle the litigation, Pfizer said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales increased 31 percent to 34.8 billion rupees in the
            three months ended June from a year earlier, Sun said. Sales of
            finished dosages in the U.S. grew 28 percent to $364 million in
            the first quarter from a year earlier, it said. Overseas sales
            accounted for 57 percent of Sun's total revenue in the year
            ended in March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sun's shares have advanced 50 percent to 505.70 rupees in
            the past year, the most among the 30 companies on the benchmark
            SP BSE Sensex. The 17-member SP BSE India Healthcare Index has
            rallied 21 percent in the past year compared with an advance of
            7 percent on the Sensex. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Panel Says Seniors Should Get Pfizer's Prevnar 13</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) won the backing of a key
            U.S. advisory panel to recommend its vaccine Prevnar 13 for
            people ages 65 and older to help prevent infections including
            pneumonia and meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory
            Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, voted 13-2
            yesterday to add Prevnar 13 to a list of recommended vaccines
            that includes Merck Co.'s Pneumovax 23. The committee plans to
            revisit the recommendation in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
            requires insurance companies to cover vaccines recommended by
            ACIP without asking patients to pay a share. With $3.97 billion
            in sales last year, the inoculation is New York-based Pfizer's
            second-best selling product. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The advisory panel considered a clinical trial Pfizer
            conducted on 85,000 patients who received either the company's
            vaccine or a placebo. Among those who got Prevnar 13, there were
            46 percent fewer first episodes of community-acquired pneumonia
            than among the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;People 65 and older who haven't received Pneumovax 23 would
            get a dose of Prevnar 13, followed by Pneumovax 23. Those who
            have been immunized with Pneumovax 23 would get a shot of
            Prevnar 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and
            disabled, would immediately cover Prevnar 13. However, it may
            take more than a year for the program to determine whether to
            pay for a following dose of Pneumovax 23 in patients who had
            never been immunized, the panel said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Expanded Use &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration first approved Prevnar 13
            for use in children in 2010, then added adults age 50 and older
            in 2011. It is already recommended for routine use in children
            younger than age 5 and people with compromised immune systems
            caused by conditions such as cancer, AIDS and advanced kidney
            disease. Merck's related vaccine, Pneumovax 23, was approved
            more than 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both therapies are approved to prevent infections from
            pneumococcus bacteria that can cause pneumonia, meningitis and
            blood and ear infections, according to the CDC. About 900,000
            Americans get pneumococcal pneumonia each year and as many as 7
            percent die, the CDC said. About 90 percent of cases are adults. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Glaxo, Pfizer's ViiV Wins Approval for HIV Combo Drug</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ViiV Healthcare Co., a joint venture
            of GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Shionogi Co. (4507), won U.S.
            approval for an HIV treatment that combines three drugs into
            one, reducing side effects and providing greater convenience for
            patients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared Triumeq for
            patients who have no past history of resistance to any of its
            component drugs, according to a statement ViiV posted today on
            its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Triumeq is made up of London-based Glaxo's Tivicay,
            developed by ViiV, and the medicines abacavir and lamivudine.
            Tivicay was approved in August 2013 and may top $1 billion in
            sales in 2016 for Glaxo, rising to $2.2 billion in 2018,
            according to the average of eight analysts' estimates compiled
            by Bloomberg. The estimates include Triumeq since the fixed-dose
            combination is based on Tivicay, according to Leerink Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are proud to announce this important milestone,
            marking the second new treatment to be approved in the U.S. from
            our pipeline of medicines,' Dominique Limet, ViiV's chief
            executive officer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, can lead to AIDS,
            which decimates immune systems. More than 1.1 million Americans
            are living with HIV, according to the Centers for Disease
            Control and Prevention. Treatment has involved a cocktail of
            drugs, making single-tablet combinations more convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tivicay is in a class of drugs called integrase inhibitors
            that interfere with one of the enzymes required for HIV to
            multiply. Triumeq is the second HIV single-dose regimen with an
            integrase inhibitor to hit the market after Stribild from Foster
            City, California-based Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stribild generated $539 million in sales last year for
            Gilead and analysts' estimate the revenue will rise to
            $1.1 billion this year. Stribild is only for patients who
            haven't been treated before. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilead is the largest manufacturer of AIDS medicines,
            including Atripla, the best-selling drug to treat the virus that
            can be used alone or with other antiretrovirals. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Rejected by Top Court on Neurontin Marketing Suits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
            $142 million award against Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and let two similar suits
            go forward with claims that the drugmaker defrauded insurers by
            illegally marketing its Neurontin epilepsy drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The justices without comment today rejected Pfizer's
            appeal, letting stand three connected federal appeals court
            decisions. The cases are part of the fallout from a 2004 guilty
            plea by Pfizer's Warner-Lambert unit to charges that it promoted
            Neurontin for unapproved 'off-label'' uses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rebuff means a nationwide class-action suit can
            proceed, seeking damages on behalf of insurers, union funds and
            employers who paid for ineffective dosages of Neurontin. Pfizer
            must also defend against a suit by Aetna Inc. (AET), which says it
            paid for more than a million off-label Neurontin prescriptions.
            In addition, the world's biggest drugmaker lost its challenge to
            a $142 million jury award won by the Kaiser Foundation's health
            plan and hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer 'strategically conducted a decade-long,
            multifaceted fraud to make Neurontin a blockbuster drug,'
            Kaiser argued in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement that it 'has strong defenses on
            the merits in the cases that will now proceed in the lower
            court.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Unapproved Uses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the Supreme Court, Pfizer argued that the Boston-based
            appeals court improperly relaxed the standards for winning a
            case under the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
            Organizations Act, known as RICO. Pfizer said the appeals court
            should have required proof that the company's marketing affected
            the prescriptions issued by individual doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lower court instead said the insurers could rely on
            aggregate data showing a link between Pfizer's promotional
            spending for unapproved uses and the number of off-label
            prescriptions written. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeals court decisions 'invite an unlimited
            escalation in RICO and related cases against pharmaceutical
            companies for off-label promotion using the shortcut of
            aggregate proof,' the New York-based company argued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suing insurers say Pfizer pitched Neurontin as a
            treatment for bipolar disorders, neuropathic pain and migraines,
            while suppressing or misrepresenting clinical studies that
            showed the drug wasn't effective for those treatments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Snake Oil' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurers point to an internal e-mail describing
            Neurontin as 'the 'snake oil' of the twentieth century.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The conduct occurred before Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert
            in 2000. In its 2004 plea agreement, Warner-Lambert admitted it
            promoted Neurontin for off-label uses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal law bars drugmakers from promoting uses that
            haven't received Food and Drug Administration approval, though
            doctors are free to prescribe medicines for off-label purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warner-Lambert's marketing increased off-label sales from
            15 percent of all Neurontin prescriptions in 1994, its first
            year on the market, to 94 percent of Pfizer's Neurontin sales in
            2002, according to federal government court filings. The drug's
            sales hit $2.3 billion in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aetna and class action cases can now go forward in a
            federal district court in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Kaiser Foundation,
            13-289. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Drugs to Be Paired With Siemens Tests as Targeted Therapy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Siemens AG (SIE) will develop diagnostic
            tests for U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc. (PFE) in an effort to sell
            medicines to the patients most likely to benefit from them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Siemens Clinical Laboratory, which is based in
            Berkeley, California, will lead product development to ensure
            efficacy, Europe's largest engineering company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Companion diagnostics are an important enabler of
            targeted therapies,' John Hubbard, Pfizer's global head of
            development, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companion diagnostics is used to evaluate a drug's
            effectiveness on particular patients. Health care companies are
            increasingly targeting the segment for future growth as
            declining health care budgets prioritize the need to ensure the
            efficacy pharmaceuticals before they are prescribed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The diagnostics division generated an earnings before
            interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margin of 20
            percent, making it one of Munich-based Siemens's most profitable
            businesses in the last fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Siemens announced similar development deals in 2012 with
            HIV drugmaker ViiV Healthcare Ltd. and Tocagen Inc., a developer
            of an experimental brain tumor treatment, to create tests that
            will determine which patients will benefit from the therapies. &lt;/p&gt;

            month, will instead leave the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schulman, a deputy to Chief Executive Officer Ian Read and
            Pfizer's general counsel, was chosen in July to lead one of the
            businesses as the New York-based company reorganizes ahead of a
            potential breakup. Albert Bourla, a 20-year Pfizer veteran, will
            now head the unit, which handles vaccines, oncology and consumer
            health products, Pfizer said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's division into two brand-drug and one off-patent
            business, set for Jan. 1, will occur as the company divests non-medicine operations. The world's biggest
            drugmaker has said it
            is narrowing its focus on a smaller group of research areas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Amy Schulman and Pfizer have agreed to separate,' the
            company said in a statement today. She will stay at the company
            for a transition period, after a five-year tenure there. The
            company didn't give a further reason for her departure or say
            she was leaving for another job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A second unit, to be led by Geno Germano, will get
            inflammation and immunology, cardiovascular and metabolic drugs,
            neuroscience, pain, rare diseases, and women's and men's health
            products. John Young will head Pfizer's established products
            business, consisting of drugs that have lost patent protection. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schulman joined Pfizer as general counsel in 2008. She was
            given leadership of the company's nutrition unit in 2010, when
            it had $1.87 billion in sales. After that unit was sold, she
            headed the $3.12-billion-a-year consumer business, before being
            assigned the newly created drug unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have enjoyed my years at Pfizer and wish the company
            and my many friends and colleagues well,' Schulman said in an
            e-mailed statement provided by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $30.14 at 4 p.m. New
            York time. The shares have gained 19 percent in the last 12
            months. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Teva to Sell Generic Viagra in 2017 in Pfizer Settlement</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Generic Viagra will hit the U.S.
            market more than two years earlier than had been anticipated
            under a settlement reached by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
            Ltd. (TEVA) and the maker of the impotence drug, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva can enter the market on Dec. 11, 2017, and will pay
            patent royalties through the expiration of the Viagra patent in
            April 2020, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement. Other
            settlement terms weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Viagra, whose chemical name is sildenafil citrate, is one
            of Pfizer's best-known medicines. Sales of the drug totaled
            $2.05 billion in 2012, the most ever. Pfizer earlier this year
            began selling the blue pill through a company-sponsored website
            to combat counterfeit versions sold online. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The medicine came from a group of compounds considered
            during research to treat high blood pressure and angina. The
            assistance with erectile dysfunction was a side effect
            discovered during testing, and the patent, issued in 2002, is
            for use of the compound to treat impotence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some aspects of the patent were earlier rejected in 2010
            because it was similar to a Chinese herb known as Horny Goat
            Weed. Teva lost its bid to invalidate the rest of the patent at
            trial, and was appealing the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for
            the Federal Circuit today dismissed the appeals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva, which has tentative U.S. regulatory approval to sell
            the generic drug, began selling copies in some European
            countries in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva, based in Petach Tikva, Israel, rose 12 cents to
            $39.84 at 4:15 p.m. in New York trading. Pfizer fell 11 cents to
            $30.14. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Among Drugmakers in U.S. Chronic Disease Project</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), Eli Lilly Co. (LLY) and
            eight other large drugmakers will partner with the U.S.
            government in a $230 million effort to identify new approaches
            to treat Alzheimer's, diabetes, lupus and arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Data generated from the work will be made public for other
            scientists to use, a move the U.S. National Institutes of Health
            called groundbreaking. The targeted diseases are some of the
            most prevalent conditions among Americans, costing the nation
            billions of dollars in treatment and lost productivity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The venture may be particularly important in Alzheimer's
            research. Since 1998, there have been more than 100 attempts to
            develop a treatment, and all have failed. The last two years
            have featured setbacks by Pfizer and Johnson Johnson. Sanofi (SAN)
            Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher has said his company
            won't pursue therapies there because the science isn't advanced
            enough to justify the risks and cost to develop a drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are going to try to increase the odds of picking the
            right targets to go after for the next generation of drug
            development,'' Francis Collins, the NIH director, said today at
            a press conference in Washington. 'We want to pick them at the
            very beginning of the development process and thus avoid wasting
            precious time and money chasing down drugs.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies and the NIH will split the $230 million cost
            about equally, Collins said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 5 million Americans suffer with Alzheimer's
            disease, and the number is expected to triple by 2050. The only
            drugs approved for the condition ease symptoms for a few months
            while the debilitating brain disease rampages on. Still, the
            treatments generate more than $5 billion annually. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biomarker Research &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Research coordinated by the NIH will include collecting
            tissue samples from thousands of patients to look for common
            'biomarkers' that might be good targets for new drugs, the
            agency said in a statement. The first projects are expected to
            last three to five years, and may lead to collaborations on
            other diseases if the research is successful, NIH said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coordinated effort 'rallies scientific key players of
            the innovation ecosystem in a more unified way,' Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and
            development for New
            York-based Pfizer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rupert Vessey, senior vice president at Whitehouse Station,
            New Jersey-based Merck Co. (MRK), identified new, innovative ways to
            develop drugs as the most critical health challenge facing the
            industry. The collaboration 'will be important to unraveling
            the mysteries of the diseases that cause suffering for
            individuals and are a burden to our society,' he said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;AbbVie, Biogen &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other companies involved are AbbVie Inc., Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB),
            Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), JJ (JNJ), Sanofi and
            Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
            will also participate, as well as nonprofit advocacy groups
            representing patients suffering from the diseases, the
            government said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We exited mental illness and largely Alzheimer's about
            four years ago, but not because we weren't interested in it, but
            because we thought it was so difficult alone,' said Lon Cardon,
            senior vice president of alternative discovery and development
            at London-based Glaxo. 'Now we're interested in the Alzheimer's
            space because we can join forces.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The NIH is the largest source of funding for biomedical
            research in the world, with an annual budget of more than $30
            billion. Much of that money is consumed by basic research into
            human biology and the study of the major causes of death,
            including cancer and infectious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency expects to spend about $1.1 billion on diabetes
            this year; $562 million on Alzheimer's; $260 million on
            arthritis and $109 million on lupus. The agency will spend $3.1
            billion researching HIV and AIDS, by comparison, the most of any
            single disease. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nestle Faces Conditions in South Africa for Pfizer Nutrition Bid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nestle SA (NESN), the world's largest food
            company, should rebrand products to get approval from South
            Africa's antitrust authority for its planned takeover of Pfizer
            Inc. (PFE)'s baby nutrition division, the regulator recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nestle should license existing Pfizer infant formula
            products to be sold by a third party for 20 years under a
            different brand to avoid an increase in infant formula prices
            resulting from the merger, the country's Competition Commission
            said in a statement today. The Vevey, Switzerland-based company
            will make its arguments tomorrow in a hearing before the
            Competition Tribunal, which will rule on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Competitors have told the commission the proposed deal
            raises 'serious competition concerns,' the regulator said.
            Nestle would be able to reintroduce the Pfizer products under
            their original brands after the 20-year period, according to the
            commission's recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nestle is seeking international approval for the
            acquisition, which will give it access to more customers in
            developing nations such as China. Mexico's antitrust regulator
            blocked the deal in its domestic market in November, forcing a
            divestment of assets in that market. Chinese and Australian
            officials cleared the transaction in their countries that same
            month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Nestle won't oppose the conditions set out by the
            commission,' Ravi Pillay, a spokesman for Nestle South Africa,
            said by phone from Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Wins Ruling to Block Generic Lyrica Until 2018</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest
            drugmaker, won a court ruling that will block generic versions
            of its No. 1 product, Lyrica, in the U.S. until December 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Actavis Plc (ACT) and Lupin
            Ltd. (LPC) are among the generic-drug makers that would infringe a
            valid patent on the pain medicine, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
            the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion today on
            its website. The other generic-drug makers in the case were Sun
            Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Wockhardt Ltd. and Mylan Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lyrica has become increasingly important to Pfizer's
            earnings since the New York-based company lost patent protection
            on its cholesterol pill Lipitor, which once generated almost $13
            billion a year. Sales of Lyrica, used to treat shingles,
            fibromyalgia, epilepsy, and hot flashes, reached $4.6 billion
            last year, accounting for 9 percent of Pfizer's total revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeal centered on a single aspect of a patent covering
            the active ingredient, pregabalin. The generic-drug makers
            argued that the patent didn't adequately describe a new
            invention, and was an obvious variation of other compounds. They
            conceded that, if the patent claim was upheld, they had no
            chance at winning on that or a second patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We perceive no error in the district court's
            construction' of what the patent claim covers, the three-judge
            panel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. (PFE) v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.,
            12-1576, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
            (Washington). The lower court case is Pfizer Inc. v. Teva
            Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 09cv307, U.S. District Court for the
            District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Sued by Australian Regulator Over Generic Lipitor</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s Australian unit was
            sued by the country's competition regulator for misuse of market
            power relating to sales of its generic version of the Lipitor
            cholesterol drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it
            filed the lawsuit today in federal court in Sydney claiming
            Pfizer Australia Pty.'s deals with pharmacies in 2012 for the
            sale of atorvastatin breached competition rules. A copy of the
            filing wasn't immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patent protection on Lipitor, the biggest selling
            prescription drug in Australia under the federal drug plan,
            expired in May 2012. At the time Lipitor was prescribed to more
            than 1 million Australians with annual sales exceeding A$700
            million ($625 million), according to the ACCC. Prior to the
            expiry Pfizer struck a deal with pharmacies, offering discounts
            and rebates on the condition they bought a minimum 12 months'
            supply of atorvastatin, the generic equivalent, the ACCC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer engaged in this conduct for the purpose of
            deterring or preventing competitors in the market for
            atorvastatin from engaging in competitive conduct,' ACCC
            Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. 'This case also raises
            an important public interest issue regarding the conduct of a
            patent holder nearing the expiry of that patent.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement today it believes the
            offers made to the pharmacies were competitive. Since the matter
            is before the court, the company said it wouldn't be appropriate
            to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ACCC said it's seeking pecuniary penalties and
            declarations, without specifying them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A preliminary hearing is scheduled to be held on Mar. 18,
            the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Retailer HM Gets Photographer's Copyright Case Dismissed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against Hennes
            Mauritz AB over the use of a photograph on its apparel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Estevan Oriol, a photographer and director, claimed that
            HM had misappropriated his 1995 photograph of hands
            demonstrating a symbol for Los Angeles. The photograph -- known
            as 'LA Fingers' or 'LA Hands' was, according to Oriol's
            complaint, featured on the cover of several magazines and used
            in his own line of clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oriol sued HM last year over the use of the image of hands
            creating the Los Angeles symbol on their apparel. He claimed the
            photo was similar to his in six ways -- the selection of film,
            camera angle, lighting and background, as well as the placement
            and size of rings on the model's hands. Judge Manuel Real on
            Feb. 10 found the alleged similarities were insufficient to

            &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Sued by Australia Regulator for Generic Lipitor Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s Australian unit was sued by the country's
            competition regulator for misuse of market power relating to
            sales of its generic version of the cholesterol drug Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it
            filed the lawsuit yesterday in federal court in Sydney claiming
            Pfizer Australia Pty.'s deals with pharmacies in 2012 for the
            sale of atorvastatin breached competition rules. A copy of the
            filing wasn't immediately available. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patent protection on Lipitor, the biggest-selling
            prescription drug in Australia under the federal drug plan,
            expired in May 2012. Prior to the expiration, the ACCC claimed
            that Pfizer offered pharmacies discounts and rebates if they
            bought a minimum 12 months' supply of the generic equivalent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer engaged in this conduct for the purpose of
            deterring or preventing competitors in the market for
            atorvastatin from engaging in competitive conduct,' ACCC
            Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement yesterday it plans to
            'vigorously defend the proceedings' and declined to comment
            further. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Kind Sues Clif Bar Over Packaging of MOJO Line &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kind LLC, the maker of Kind energy bars, sued Clif Bar
            Co. alleging that the redesigned packaging and formulation of
            its MOJO line infringes Kind's trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Keely Wachs, spokesman for Clif Bar, said in an e-mail that
            the MOJO line was introduced in 2002. He didn't comment on the
            lawsuit filed Feb. 6 in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Mervis, Kind's general counsel, didn't return a call
            seeking comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Kind LLC v. Clif Bar Co., 14-cv-00770, U.S.

            &lt;h2&gt;Museum in Harper Lee's Hometown Fails to Win Lawsuit Dismissal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A trademark lawsuit by Harper Lee, the author of 'To Kill
            a Mockingbird' who filed against a museum that capitalized on
            the book, will go forward, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judge William H. Steele of the federal court in Mobile,
            Alabama, on Feb. 7 declined to dismiss any of Lee's nine claims
            against the Monroe County Heritage Museum Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steele held that the motion to dismiss lacked legal
            reasoning and instead relied on 'bald conclusions' that fell
            short of demonstrating that any claims should be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee claims the museum, which contains exhibits that feature
            both her name and the title of her book, violate federal and
            state trademark law. At the time Lee filed her complaint, the
            museum was using the domain name www.tokillamockingbird.com. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee claimed that Monroeville, Ala., is attempting to
            capitalize on the success of the novel, which was set in
            fictional Maycomb County, Ala. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Lee v. Monroe County Heritage Museum Inc.,

            Alabama (Mobile). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;European swap-trading platforms won
            a reprieve from Dodd-Frank Act rules in a deal that puts U.S.
            and European authorities on a path toward sharing oversight of
            most of the $693 trillion global market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and European
            Union officials, in an agreement announced Feb. 12, granted the
            trading facilities relief until March 24 from U.S. registration.
            U.K. and European regulators also are implementing trading rules
            designed to meet U.S. standards that could then be relied on to
            substitute for Dodd-Frank oversight in the long-term, said Mark
            P. Wetjen, acting CFTC chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CFTC said in a summary of the deal that it would revoke
            the relief to trading platforms if they fail to meet U.S.
            conditions for competition and transparency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many interest-rate swaps will be required to trade on swap
            execution facilities, or Sefs, in the U.S. under CFTC rules
            starting Feb. 15. Platforms owned by Tradeweb Markets LLC, ICAP
            Plc (IAP), GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) and Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News,
            have temporarily registered with the CFTC. The Sefs facilitate
            transactions among banks and between banks and asset managers or
            other clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The international reach of CFTC rules has been among the
            most contentious issues between the Washington-based regulator
            and financial firms that operate around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wetjen said the primary platforms affected are in London. &lt;/p&gt;

            State Street Corp. (STT)'s U.K. unit that led to a 22.9 million-pound

            competition regulator for misuse of market power relating to
            sales of its generic version of the Lipitor cholesterol drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator said it filed the lawsuit yesterday in
            federal court in Sydney claiming Pfizer Australia Pty.'s deals
            with pharmacies in 2012 for the sale of atorvastatin breached
            competition rules because by giving unfair incentives to the
            pharmacies to sell the drug upon the expiration of the Lipitor
            patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement yesterday it believes
            the offers made to the pharmacies were competitive, and declined
            to comment further because the matter is before the court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule Bankers' Lawsuit Dropped as Regulations Revised &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The American Bankers Association is dropping its lawsuit
            challenging a provision of the Volcker Rule that requires
            community banks to divest their holdings in some collateralized
            debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The industry group, which previously said banks would
            suffer losses of $600 million because of the provision, is
            working with regulators which have already made changes to the
            rule that 'allowed many banks to avoid taking hundreds of
            millions of dollars in unnecessary writedowns,' Frank Keating,
            the president of the association, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group had objected to a portion of the rule that would
            force lenders to get rid of CDOs backed by trust-preferred
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The district court case is American Bankers Association v.
            Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 13-cv-02050, U.S. District
            Court, District of Columbia (Washington). The appeals court case
            is American Bankers Association v. Federal Reserve System,
            13-1310, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
            Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Vaccine Meets Goals in Post-Approval Study</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s pneumonia vaccine met
            the goals of a study that was required by U.S. regulators when
            the therapy was approved for patients at least 50 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The clinical trial called Capita showed the vaccine worked
            against a first episode of vaccine-type community-acquired
            pneumonia in patients 65 and older, Pfizer said today in a
            statement. The Food and Drug Administration approved Prevnar 13
            for adults 50 and older in December 2011 on an accelerated basis
            with the condition the New York company prove the shot protects
            against pneumonia in post-clearance studies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The vaccine is expected to generate $4.4 billion in revenue
            this year, according to the average of three analysts' estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg. Prevnar 13 competes with Merck Co.'s
            Pneumovax 23, approved about 30 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The vaccine's use in adults is expected to contribute $1
            billion to sales, Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group,
            said in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.7 percent to $31.99 at the close in New York.
            The company has gained 17 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FDA approval was based on studies that showed patients
            taking Prevnar 13 had comparable or higher antibody levels than
            those taking Pneumovax 23. The results indicated the vaccine was
            reasonably likely to produce clinical benefit, which is what
            Pfizer sought to prove in the Capita trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to share detailed results from the trial at a
            conference in India on March 12, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13 was approved in the U.S. in 2010 for children 6
            weeks to 5 years old. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer May Push $5 Billion Breast Cancer Hope for Ruling</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's largest
            drugmaker, is weighing whether to ask U.S. regulators to
            expedite their review of a potential $5 billion-a-year treatment
            to slow a type of incurable breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The therapy, called PD 0332991, generated excitement among
            oncologists in December after data showed the drug stopped
            disease progression for more than two years in 165 patients.
            That trial was done in the second of three stages of research
            regularly required for Food and Drug administration approval. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FDA has cleared cancer drugs for sale before final
            trial results are completed, including New York-based Pfizer's
            Xalkori for lung tumors in 2011 and Novartis AG (NOVN)'s Gleevec for
            leukemia a decade earlier. While no company decision has been
            made to push for early clearance, 'There are some precedents
            for approval after Phase 2,' said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's head
            of worldwide research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We'll see whether there are ways to accelerate
            availability of the drug for patients,' Dolsten said in an
            interview at the JPMorgan Chase Co. health conference in San
            Francisco. 'We're obviously open to dialogues and advice from
            FDA and the European agencies.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer climbed 1.1 percent to $26.76 at the close of New
            York trading. The shares have increased 22 percent in the last
            12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drugmaker hopes to start the final-stage trial by the
            end of March, said Geno Germano, who heads the company's
            oncology and specialty care businesses. The medicine is the
            first in a new class of agents that works by blocking a protein
            critical in the cancer cell cycle, lead researcher Richard Finn
            said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Metastatic Disease &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The study unveiled in December included women with tumors
            fueled by the hormone estrogen, the most common type of breast
            cancer. All had metastatic disease, which had spread to other
            parts of the body and is no longer considered curable. Almost
            230,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer
            this year, and more than 39,900 will die from it, according to
            the American Cancer Society. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If cleared, Pfizer's drug may generate as much as $5
            billion in yearly sales, wrote Andrew Baum, an analyst at
            Citigroup Inc., in a Nov. 29 note to investors. That comes as
            Pfizer is seeking new treatments to replace the $10 billion in
            losses from its cholesterol medicine Lipitor, the world's best-
            selling pill with $13 billion in sales before losing market
            exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By the end of this year, we're going to have the Phase 3
            enrolling, we're going to have two Phase 2s done, and we're
            going to be talking to the agency about getting the product to
            patients,' Germano said in an interview at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Data Available &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The positive Phase 2 results, which showed the drug was
            safe, may give Pfizer much of the data it could use to justify
            seeking an early ruling, even without the larger number of
            patients usually tested in a late-stage study, Dolsten said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The patients tolerate it very, very well, and that brings
            the two components of benefit and risk to the table,' he said.
            The agency has been 'very thoughtful when it comes to making
            those judgments on when they can accelerate access of drugs and
            approve them on a smaller dataset than a traditional approval.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baum, the Citigroup analyst, said in his note that Pfizer
            is already at least two years ahead of its closest competitors,
            Eli Lilly Co. (LLY) and Novartis, with similar cancer drugs in
            development. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Gets High Court Inquiry on Asbestos Suit Shield</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court signaled
            interest in Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s bid for a shield from some asbestos
            lawsuits connected to its Quigley Co. subsidiary, a bankrupt
            unit that stopped most operations in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The justices today asked the Obama administration for
            advice on Pfizer's appeal of a ruling that opened the New York-
            based drugmaker to some claims related to Quigley. That company
            made asbestos-containing products for the steel industry from
            the 1940s to the 1970s. Pfizer acquired Quigley in 1968.
            Asbestos, once widely used an insulator, was later shown to
            cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, contends that
            Quigley's bankruptcy proceedings insulate the parent company
            from suits filed by the Baltimore law firm of Peter Angelos. The
            firm began suing Pfizer in Pennsylvania state courts in 1999,
            saying the company was legally responsible for some claims
            because its logo appeared on Quigley products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer says it played no role in making or selling the
            Quigley products. A federal appeals court in New York said the
            claims against Pfizer could go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Law Offices of Peter
            Angelos, 12-300. The bankruptcy case is In re Quigley Co.,
            04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's largest
            drugmaker, is among companies weighing a purchase of the
            injectable-medicines unit of Indian drug supplier Strides
            Arcolab Ltd. (STR), said three people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer began due diligence last week for a possible
            acquisition of the Bangalore-based company's division known as
            Agila Specialties, the people said, asking not to be identified
            as the process is private. The unit may be valued at about $2
            billion, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strides provides Pfizer with generic versions of off-patent
            drugs through a partnership announced in 2010. Agila has also
            drawn interest from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan Inc.,
            Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG (NOVN), and Fresenius SE, which is based in
            Bad Homburg, Germany, two of the people said. A deal could be
            reached in the first quarter, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Large drugmakers are seeking acquisitions to offset a
            potential decline in revenue as U.S. patents expire. With drugs
            losing patent protection this year and last, New York-based
            Pfizer may lose as much as $2.75 billion in sales in 2013, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strides rose as much as 3.9 percent to 1095 rupees in
            Mumbai today, the most since Dec. 24. Representatives for
            Pfizer, Mylan and Novartis declined to comment, while a
            spokesman for Strides didn't respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cancer, Antibiotics &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a market leader, Fresenius is very often brought into
            contact with companies that potentially may be for sale,'
            Fresenius spokesman Matthias Link said in an e-mail. He declined
            to comment on any potential deal with Strides. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strides started trying to sell Agila last year, three
            people with knowledge of the matter said in August. Agila, which
            makes cancer treatments and antibiotics, accounted for 74
            percent of Strides's earnings before interest, taxes,
            depreciation and amortization in the nine months through
            September, a company release from October shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Agila's sales jumped to 10 billion rupees ($183 million) in
            the nine-month period, from 7.4 billion rupees a year earlier,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In May 2009, Novartis paid about 4.7 times sales for
            Unterach, Austria-based Ebewe Pharma's injectable-drug unit in a
            $1.2 billion purchase. Mylan acquired closely held injectable-
            drug business Bioniche Pharma Holdings Ltd. for $550 million in
            2010, paying about 4.2 times annual revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The same year, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced the
            acquisition of Mumbai-based Piramal Healthcare Ltd.'s branded
            generic-medicine unit for $3.72 billion, paying about 8.7 times
            sales. The deal was worth more than Piramal's $2.5 billion
            market value at the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strides's profit will more than quadruple to 9.2 billion
            rupees this year, according to the average of nine analysts'
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company has 14
            manufacturing facilities in six countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strides sold Ascent Pharmahealth Ltd., its Australian and
            Southeast Asian unit, to Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) in January
            2012 for A$375 million ($396 million) in cash. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Possible Unit Shuffle Triggers Breakup Concern</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s four business units may be combined into two, a top company official said,
            triggering speculation by analysts that the world's biggest drugmaker is preparing to split in half. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's units cover oncology, primary care, specialty drugs, and so-called established products,
            which are medicines that have lost patent protection and are sold against generics. That's 'probably going
            to evolve to two, where there's the innovative business and the value business,' Geno Germano, president of
            the specialty care and oncology businesses, said in a Jan. 8 interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive
            Officer Ian Read took over New York-based Pfizer in 2010, as the company was digesting the 2009 acquisition
            of Wyeth and preparing for the loss of its top- selling product Lipitor. Under Read, Pfizer has cut research
            and operations and is divesting non-drug businesses, such as animal health and infant nutrition. Those
            actions have created questions about whether a bigger breakup is on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            possible reorganization outlined by Germano may be another step toward a split by Pfizer two to three years
            down the line, said Mark Schoenebaum, an ISI Group Inc. analyst. Such a move would be similar to the action
            by Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which spun off its brand-drug business Jan. 1 as the new company AbbVie Inc.
            (ABBV) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer, Bristol Drug Wins NICE Nod for Irregular Heartbeats</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
            Co. (BMY)'s Eliquis won the backing of the U.K.'s health-cost
            regulator for people with an irregular heartbeat, putting the
            drug in line to be the third new treatment recommended for such
            patients in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence
            issued draft guidance recommending the blood thinner to prevent
            strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, the agency said
            today in an e-mailed statement. NICE asked patients and doctors
            to talk before using Eliquis about whether to choose one of the
            other two new drugs or the older medicine warfarin instead. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eliquis will compete with Bayer AG (BAYN) and Johnson Johnson (JNJ)'s
            Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH's Pradaxa to replace
            warfarin, a decades-old medicine that had previously been the
            standard of care for people with an erratic heartbeat. Both of
            the other drugs won a recommendation from NICE last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The appraisal committee heard from patient experts that
            warfarin can have a greater impact on a person's quality of life
            than atrial fibrillation itself,' Carole Longson, director of
            NICE's Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said in the
            statement, citing the older drug's interactions with food,
            alcohol and other medicines, and the regular monitoring it
            requires. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NICE, which advises the state-run National Health Service
            on getting medical value for its money, said it will probably
            issue final guidance on Eliquis, also known as apixaban, in
            February. The agency recommended the pill in January 2012 for
            people who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The recommendation 'confirms the value of apixaban as a
            cost-effective oral anticoagulant,' Amadou Diarra, vice
            president of the U.K. and Ireland for Bristol-Myers, said in an
            e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 46,000 new cases of atrial fibrillation are
            diagnosed in the U.K. each year, according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Aims at Lower Tax Rate as Share Buybacks Continue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. reported profit that
            beat analysts' estimates after lowering its industry-high tax
            rate, an effort the world's biggest drugmaker said will continue
            as it repurchases billions in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer projected an effective tax rate of 27 percent for
            this year. That may be difficult to reduce further as the New
            York-based company plans to keep bringing back cash from
            overseas and is taxed by the U.S. government for doing so. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's nothing that anyone's doing in a tax-planning
            environment that we're not doing,' Frank D'Amelio, the
            company's chief financial officer, said today in an interview.
            Profit earned in low-tax overseas jurisdictions is taxed at
            higher U.S. rates when repatriated for dividends and buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have been watching for a potential breakup of
            Pfizer's drug business after Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
            divested the nutrition and animal health businesses over the
            past two years. Pfizer is dividing internal operations into
            three units, though any full split probably wouldn't happen
            until 2017, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read today didn't comment on whether the company would
            actually split. Pfizer's established products line, which
            consists of medicines that are no longer patent protected, has
            attracted the interest of generic-drug makers including Mylan
            Inc. and Actavis Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer to 3M Beating Sales Estimates at Highest Rate Since 2011</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. companies from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to
            3M Co. (MMM) are beating analysts' quarterly sales estimates at the
            highest rate in 1 1/2 years, undeterred by political gridlock in
            Washington and slowing demand in China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of 175 companies in the Standard Poor's 500 Index that
            have reported fourth-quarter results so far, 67 percent have
            exceeded analysts' average revenue projections. That's the
            highest percentage since the second quarter of 2011, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fewer than half the companies had
            surprise sales gains in the second and third quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, today reported
            revenue of $15.1 billion, beating the estimate of $14.4 billion
            in its biggest positive surprise in five quarters. 3M, which
            reaches both companies and consumers with products from
            sandpaper to Post-it sticky notes, last week exceeded
            projections on its best sales gain in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are seeing a pickup in global growth and business
            activity, so companies are beating' estimates, Nick Raich,
            research director at KeyCorp's private banking unit in
            Cleveland, said yesterday. The unit manages about $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) topped fourth-quarter sales estimates today
            with a 5.8 percent increase on higher F-Series pickup demand.
            Ford's automotive revenue rose to $34.5 billion, ahead of the
            $33 billion average prediction on higher F-Series pickup demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), the largest U.S. Web portal, yesterday posted
            a 4.5 percent sales increase for its biggest jump in more than
            four years. The Sunnyvale, California-based company in 2012
            recorded its first revenue gain in four years after collecting
            higher prices for ads placed on the company's pages and
            increasing revenue from search-related marketing messages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Markets Respond &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yahoo's profit also beat estimates, putting it among the 76
            percent of SP 500 companies reporting so far that exceeded
            earnings projections. The third-quarter rate was 71 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While sales gains for SP 500 (SPX) companies may more than
            quadruple to 4.6 percent by this year's third quarter, based on
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the results may be uneven.
            Ford, for example, today said its 2013 loss in Europe may be
            bigger than its previous projection because a possible recession
            would sap demand for cars. And yesterday, Yahoo's sales
            forecasts for the current quarter and 2013 fell short of
            analysts' predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even so, stock markets worldwide are reflecting companies'
            improving performances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 5.2 percent this year through yesterday,
            aided by low interest and mortgage rates that have spurred
            borrowing and demand for housing. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)
            rose about 3.5 percent in the same period while the FTSE MIB
            Index (FTSEMIB), consisting of 40 stocks listed on the Borsa Italiana,
            climbed 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Sustained Growth' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The economic fundamentals are increasingly warming for
            sustained economic growth and higher equity prices,' Ed Hyman,
            chairman of New York-based International Strategy Investment
            Group, wrote today in a note to clients. 'Despite tax hikes and
            budget-negotiations overhang, weekly, monthly and first-quarter
            preliminary economic data seems robust.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M boosted sales by 4.2 percent
            with higher demand in the U.S., Latin America and China. Sales
            from existing businesses climbed 16 percent in China, even as
            economic growth slowed in Asia last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For the base business we see a recovery coming and we
            feel optimistic about that,' 3M Chief Executive Officer Inge Thulin told analysts last week. 'We're still
            cautious.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reflecting that caution, some of the companies are matching
            or beating previously lowered forecasts. Peoria, Illinois-based
            Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), the largest maker of construction and mining
            equipment, yesterday reported revenue sank 6.8 percent, matching
            the average estimate, as machinery dealers cut orders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Caterpillar Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The second half of 2012 really sputtered,' Caterpillar
            CEO Doug Oberhelman said in a Jan. 28 interview on Bloomberg
            Television. 'We had the fiscal cliff, the steady din of that,
            we had the uncertainty of an election.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even so, Oberhelman said he is 'pretty optimistic about
            '13 around the world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The worldwide economy may grow at least 2.5 percent this
            year, up from about 2.3 percent in 2012, Caterpillar projected.
            The company sees U.S. economic growth of at least 2.5 percent,
            helped by housing, and 8.5 percent expansion in China as its
            government boosts credit growth and infrastructure spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., economic growth shows signs of withstanding
            political debates about federal deficits and spending. Orders
            for durable goods rose in December for an unprecedented fourth
            straight month, indicating manufacturing will improve in 2013, a
            Commerce Department report showed Jan. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Broad-Based Gain' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see just basically broad-based gain,' John Herrmann,
            president of Herrmann Forecasting LLC in Summit, New Jersey,
            said in an interview yesterday on Bloomberg Radio's 'Bloomberg
            Surveillance.' 'This is just a solid report. We are seeing
            more risk taking by businesses and by investors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Businesses don't yet know whether lawmakers will avert
            across-the-board government spending cuts scheduled to begin
            March 1, even after the fiscal pact passed by Congress on Jan. 1
            avoided sweeping tax increases that had threatened to crimp
            consumer spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our visibility to forecast the coming couple of months is
            extremely limited,' Erik Gershwind, CEO of MSC Industrial
            Direct Co., told analysts earlier this month. Fiscal first-
            quarter revenue for the Melville, New York-based company missed
            analysts' estimates, as did its profit forecast for the second
            quarter, after customers restrained orders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For now, Caterpillar's CEO said 2013 is shaping up for
            improved performance worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'China certainly is stronger today,' Oberhelman told
            Bloomberg Television. 'Latin America looks pretty good. Boy,
            the drumbeat out of Europe is sure behind us. All the bad news
            is out, at least for a while.' &lt;/p&gt;

            unit a market value of about $11.8 billion at the midpoint of the range, regulatory filings show. The IPO,
            which may raise as much as $2.2 billion, would make Zoetis the largest public company of its kind -- and one
            of the only focused solely on medicines for animals, competing with businesses owned by such drugmakers as
            Sanofi and Merck Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The IPO is well-timed -- coming as stocks hit 5-year highs -- and
            represents another step by Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read to slim down and focus on developing new
            prescription drugs. Both Novartis AG and Bayer AG explored a purchase of Zoetis last year, according to
            people familiar, reflecting the attractiveness of the animal-health industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Globally,
            people are feeling wealthier, which tends to mean more demand for meat for human consumption,' said Erik
            Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. 'They're also more likely to
            have pets and more likely to take better care of their pets.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Eliquis Stops Blood Clots as Well as Standard</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Eliquis, the blood thinner sold by
            Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY), was as good as the
            current standard of care in preventing blood clots and with
            fewer bleeding complications, according to a study. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a trial of 5,400 people, the drug was found to be
            equivalent to the generic warfarin at preventing new clots and
            death in patients who had a venous thromboembolism, or VTE. In
            VTE, clots form in the body's large arteries, often in the legs
            or pelvis. The clots can then break off and travel into the
            lungs, causing a potentially deadly pulmonary embolism. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eliquis is one of three in a new class of blood thinners
            that may replace warfarin, a half-century old therapy that needs
            regular monitoring and requires patients to avoid certain foods.
            Bristol-Myers and Pfizer will use the results of the study to
            apply to regulators for using Eliquis in short- and long-term
            treatment of VTE. It's already approved for stroke prevention in
            patients with irregular heartbeat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have data to support a real change in clinical
            practice,' said Giancarlo Agnelli, a professor of internal
            medicine at Italy's University of Perugia who led the trial.
            Current therapy 'has some limitations,' he said. With Eliquis,
            'we have a new compound and a new way to give it that's much,
            much easier.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, both based in New York, sponsored
            the trial. It is being published in the New England Journal of
            Medicine and presented at the Congress of the International
            Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis in Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell less than 1 percent to $27.78 at the
            close in New York. Bristol-Myers rose less than 1 percent to
            $44.82. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Study Findings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patients in the study were given Eliquis or warfarin for
            six months after being diagnosed with a VTE that came on
            suddenly, instead of from an expected cause such as surgery or
            childbirth. Of the patients on Eliquis, 2.3 percent died or had
            another clot, compared with 2.7 percent on warfarin. The
            warfarin patients also typically received heparin, another blood
            thinner typically given in a hospital, in the early part of
            treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This population is of very high risk of recurrence,'
            Agnelli, referring to a deep-vein thrombosis, said in a
            telephone interview. 'If you have deep-vein thrombosis after
            surgery, the recurrence rate is much lower.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eliquis was better than warfarin in terms of safety, the
            trial also found. In the study, 0.6 percent of patients on
            Eliquis had major bleeding -- for example inside the eye, skull,
            gastro-intestinal tract or in other major organs -- compared
            with 1.8 percent of patients on warfarin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Competing Drugs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Xarelto, a competing drug sold by Leverkusen, Germany-based
            Bayer AG (BAYN) and New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson Johnson (JNJ),
            already is approved for VTE. Boehringer Ingelheim's Pradaxa,
            also one of the new wave of blood thinners, isn't yet approved
            in the U.S. for VTE. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New treatments for VTE can help save money because they can
            shorten the time patients are taking the heparin, often the
            first treatment they get before warfarin, and staying in the
            hospital, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann
            Co. 'Venous thrombosis treatment with Xarelto is a big cost-saver for hospitals, driving incremental access
            and uptake,' he
            said in an April 5 note to clients. 'Success in VTE treatment
            could be a major boon to BMY/PFE's Eliquis,' Fernandez said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From 300,000 to 900,000 people in the U.S. have a venous
            thromboembolism each year, according to the Centers for Disease
            Control and Prevention in Atlanta. About half of those occur
            after a hospital stay or surgery, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Novartis Among Suitors for Onyx</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), Pfizer Inc. and
            Novartis AG (NOVN) are among the suitors preparing bids for Onyx
            Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX), the drugmaker that snubbed an unsolicited
            offer from Amgen (AMGN) Inc., said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies, which signed confidentiality agreements and
            hired advisers, may make first-round bids this week, according
            to the people, who asked not to be named because the process is
            private. Onyx disclosed last month that it's working with
            advisers on finding bidders following its rejection of Amgen's
            bid of $120 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amgen is still interested and is doing due diligence, said
            three people with knowledge of the process. Shares of South San
            Francisco, California-based Onyx have consistently traded at
            more than that price since the proposal from Thousand Oaks,
            California-based Amgen surfaced in June, indicating the
            successful suitor may have to beat that offer by a wide margin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Onyx rose 2.3 percent to $129.25 at the close in New York,
            giving the company a market value of about $9.4 billion.
            Representatives for London-based AstraZeneca, Amgen, New York-based Pfizer, Novartis and Onyx declined to
            comment. There's no
            guarantee any of the companies will bid. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Splits Up Operations Ahead of Possible Breakup</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, said it will split up its three major internal
            businesses and shuffle the management that leads them, part of
            the company's preparation for a further break up. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer in 2012 sold its infant nutrition business to Nestle
            SA (NESN) for $11.9 billion and this year spun off its $4.3 billion-a-year animal-health unit. The latest
            reorganization divides
            what's left of the company into two brand-name drug units and a
            generics business, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Read is positioning the New
            York-based drugmaker for a potential breakup that may leave just
            two units intact: A brand-name drug business with higher margins
            and growth, and a cash-generating 'value' business composed of
            the company's off-patent products. Such a split could happen in
            two to three years, Read has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This represents the next steps in Pfizer's journey to
            further revitalize our innovative core,' Read said in the
            statement. 'Our new commercial operating model will provide
            each business with an enhanced ability to respond to market
            dynamics, greater visibility and focus, and distinctive
            capabilities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose less than 1 percent to $29.54 at 4 p.m.
            New York time, after jumping 24 percent over the last 12 months.
            The company reports second-quarter earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Leaders &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes will give investors a detailed look at the
            financial results of each segment to help them assess a split.
            Geno Germano, who previously ran Pfizer's specialty and oncology
            units, will head one, the company said. Amy Schulman, the
            company's top lawyer who also ran the drugmaker's consumer unit,
            will head another. John Young, who ran Pfizer's primary care
            business, will head the generics business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Germano's business unit will have drugs in inflammation and
            immunology, cardiovascular disease, rare disease, men's and
            women's health, pain and neurosciences, and rare diseases. That
            would include new potential blockbusters Eliquis, a blood
            thinner, and Xeljanz, a rheumatoid arthritis drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schulman's business will include vaccines and cancer drugs,
            as well as consumer products. Palbociclib, an experimental
            therapy being studied in breast and other cancers, has the
            potential to be one of Pfizer's biggest future products. It
            would also include Prevnar, a pneumococcal disease vaccine that
            was the company's fourth-biggest product in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer CEO Still Hunting for Deals and Willing to Go Big</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Failing to buy AstraZeneca Plc with
            the drug industry's largest-ever deal hasn't stopped Pfizer
            Inc. (PFE)'s Ian Read from looking far and wide for acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to look at all types of business development,
            regardless of size, that we believe would add value to
            shareholders,' Read, the company's chief executive officer,
            said today on a conference call after his company announced
            second-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That may mean a deal that allows New York-based Pfizer to
            decamp from the U.S. for a lower-tax jurisdiction overseas, one
            of the goals for a merger with London-based AstraZeneca.
            American drugmakers are forced abroad by the U.S.'s corporate
            tax rate, Read said, the highest in the developed world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's no substantial advantage to being a U.S. company,
            to doing business in the U.S.,' he said by telephone. 'We are
            at a tremendous competitive disadvantage.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S.-based drugmakers pay a 35 percent rate on all
            earnings, whether made here or abroad. Foreign companies pay
            that rate only on profits they earn in the U.S. That's unfair,
            Read said. He's said he's tired of criticism directed at
            companies and CEOs for doing what he says may be the best
            strategy to help shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s two new brand-drug
            units will operate on a separate basis, reporting independent
            profits and losses, under the leaders that Chief Executive
            Officer Ian Read elevated to head them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The businesses, along with an established products line
            that could be split from the company after 2017, will report
            separate results that will show investors how each line of
            drugs, and the leaders managing them, are performing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I wanted to focus great executive talent on both of those
            segments of the business,' Read said in a telephone interview
            today after the New York-based company reported second-quarter
            earnings. The units, led by Geno Germano and Amy Schulman, have
            different needs and strategies, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer is in the middle of a transition that may see the
            world's largest drugmaker broken up into a brand-medicine
            company, which Read calls the 'innovative core,' and a
            generics business. Such a split almost certainly wouldn't happen
            until at least 2017, in part because Pfizer needs three years of
            audited financial statements, as well as time to get the
            businesses running smoothly on a separate basis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our current thinking is that this is about getting all
            three of these businesses to hum internally,' Chief Financial
            Officer Frank D'Amelio said today on a conference call. D'Amelio
            said it would be difficult to split the company before 2017 if
            Pfizer decides to take that ultimate step. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Agrees to $325 Million Neurontin Marketing Accord</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $325
            million to settle a lawsuit brought by health-care benefit
            providers who claimed the drugmaker marketed the epilepsy drug
            Neurontin for unapproved uses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement, which needs approval from a federal judge
            in Boston, would end a case over claims that the company's
            Parke-Davis unit schemed to market the drug for unapproved
            conditions as early as 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord was disclosed in court papers filed May 30 in
            Boston federal court, about six weeks after New York-based
            Pfizer agreed to a $190 million settlement over Neurontin in a
            separate case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Boston accord will resolve 'all third-party payer
            claims regarding off-label promotion' and state antitrust
            claims over Neurontin sales, Steve Danehy, a company spokesman,
            said in a statement. Pfizer didn't admit wrongdoing, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'After more than ten years of hard-fought litigation, the
            parties have reached a settlement that will bring this
            litigation to a close,' lawyers for the benefit firms said in a
            memorandum filed May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies alleged that Parke-Davis, part of Warner-Lambert Co., paid kickbacks to doctors to
            encourage them to
            prescribe the anti-seizure drug for unapproved uses such as
            bipolar and panic disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000 and 'deliberately
            expanded the promotion of off-label uses,' lawyers for the
            benefits firms said in an amended complaint filed in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Unapproved Uses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies including Louisiana Blue Cross/Blue Shield sought
            to recover 'billions of dollars' they paid as a result of a
            scheme to market and sell Neurontin 'for a variety of uses for
            which it is not approved or medically efficacious,' according
            to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drug is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and pain
            from shingles or herpes zoster. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the other settlement, disclosed in April, Pfizer agreed
            to pay $190 million to end a suit over claims it violated U.S.
            antitrust law by delaying generic versions of Neurontin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drugmaker delayed competition by 'improperly listing
            certain patents with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
            engaging in illegal promotion and sales of Neurontin for
            unapproved uses, filing and maintaining sham litigations with
            respect to certain patents, and making misrepresentations to the

        <headline>Price the Reason Pfizer-AstraZeneca Deal Died, CFO Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Financial Officer
            Frank D'Amelio said the company's $117 billion bid for
            AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) broke down over price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, set a ceiling for how
            much it would pay for London-based AstraZeneca and wasn't
            willing to go over that limit, D'Amelio said today at an
            investment conference organized by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            While New York-based Pfizer can approach AstraZeneca again after
            a U.K. regulatory period ends in six months, D'Amelio said he
            couldn't comment about whether it will do so. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;D'Amelio also said Pfizer's attempt at a mega-merger
            doesn't rule out the possibility the company will instead break
            up into smaller parts. AstraZeneca last month rejected a
            takeover offer valued at 55 pounds a share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In a word it was price,' that kept the two companies
            from sealing a deal, D'Amelio said. 'Any other issues that were
            raised during negotiations and conversations I think we were
            able to adequately, effectively address those.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer was seeking to lower its tax rate
            through the deal by moving its official headquarters to London.
            The company also sought to gain from AstraZeneca's experimental
            immune therapy cancer drugs, a new class of treatments that
            would have filled a hole in Pfizer's product portfolio.
            AstraZeneca has predicted those products may help raise its
            annual sales by 75 percent to $45 billion by 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

            and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. will pay $2.15 billion to
            Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and a partner to settle litigation over unauthorized
            sales of the heartburn drug Protonix. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, will receive

            Co. will get the rest, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement
            today. Teva will pay $1.6 billion, including $800 million this
            year and the rest in 2014, according to a company statement. Sun
            said it will pay $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased with today's settlement, which recognizes

            Amy Schulman, Pfizer's general counsel, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva and Sun (SUNP) began selling generic versions in 2008 only to
            lose a challenge to a patent on the medicine two years later.
            Pfizer's Wyeth unit was seeking $2.7 billion from Teva and Sun,
            saying it was entitled to a share of the revenue from those
            generic versions, as well as compensation for sales it lost to
            the copycat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A trial over Pfizer's claims began June 3 in federal court

        <headline>Pfizer's Two New Top Pills Selling Slower Than Expected</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s touted two new drugs
            aren't selling as fast as the company anticipated, a top
            executive said today, though the drugmaker expects the pills
            should still become blockbusters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eliquis, a blood thinner, and Xeljanz, a rheumatoid
            arthritis medicine, were approved late last year and projected
            to be the backbone of new sales growth at the world's biggest
            drugmaker. The pills are competing against well-entrenched
            products, though, and Pfizer hasn't been able to gain as much of
            the market in the first months of sales as it had hoped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The trajectory isn't what we would have liked it to have
            been,' Geno Germano, who heads New York-based Pfizer's
            specialty drugs and oncology businesses, said of Xeljanz. With
            Eliquis, he said, two competing pills have made early sales
            harder. 'I think some of the low-hanging fruit has been taken
            by the entries that came before Eliquis,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer is counting on the new drugs and cancer treatments
            and vaccines in development, to return the company to sales
            growth after losing top product Lipitor to generic competition
            in November 2011. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has shed non-drug units to focus on developing new
            brand-name therapies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eliquis may generate $613 million in annual sales for
            Pfizer by 2016, according to the average of three analysts'
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Xeljanz may have $1.6 billion
            in sales by then, according to the analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.5 percent to $28.85 at 1:07 p.m. New York
            time. The stock gained 28 percent in the 12 months through
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Blood Thinner &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eliquis is competing to replace warfarin, a generic pill
            used to prevent strokes, and with Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH's
            Pradaxa, and Bayer AG (BAYN) and Johnson Johnson's Xarelto. While
            Eliquis is considered to have superior clinical data, its rivals
            were approved earlier and have had time to establish themselves
            with doctors and patients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think some of us are a little bit surprised, given the
            strength of the label, the strength of the field force,' said
            Jami Rubin, an analyst with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Germano's
            comments came today at an investor conference hosted by Goldman.
            'The trajectory of the launch is a little bit below what some
            of us had expected,' Rubin said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer is splitting promotion and sales of Eliquis with New
            York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) A direct-to-consumer ad
            campaign should begin soon, Germano said, without giving a
            timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think that ultimately, the profile will prevail,'
            Germano said of Eliquis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sluggish Start &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rubin said Xeljanz's first months of sales also were below
            expectations. 'From our perspective, it does look a little bit
            lower than I would have thought,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Xeljanz is approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis. It
            competes directly with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)'s Humira, an injection, and
            is approved for use after patients fail a first-line therapy,
            typically methotrexate. Germano said that about half of the
            patients now taking Xeljanz had failed treatment on
            methotrexate, and the other half were those who no longer
            responded to Humira or related medications. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everything I see and hear is positive,' Germano said.
            'Changing practice just takes a lot of work.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some health insurers and drug benefit managers were
            limiting access to Xeljanz and forcing patients to try multiple
            other therapies before getting access to the new drug, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These are issues for all of us. I'm not going to say we
            don't have those issues. But we don't seem to have a pattern of
            reimbursement that's different.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SAP, Pfizer-Teva, FIFA, Agilent: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP) won a U.S. patent office
            ruling that could help it avoid paying a $345 million jury
            verdict over a way to customize pricing, in the first challenge
            under a new rule for reconsidering business methods patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said June 11 that the
            patent claims owned by closely held Versata Software Inc. should
            be canceled because they seek to cover a mental process rather
            than an actual invention. In May, an appeals court upheld the
            infringement verdict and damage award while the validity of the
            patent wasn't an issue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision by the PTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board
            could give SAP more ammunition in its petition asking for a
            reconsideration of the May decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals
            for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which specializes in
            patent law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With modifications and interest, the jury award has grown
            to more than $400 million, Versata lawyers have said. SAP, the
            largest maker of business-management software, reported $11.8
            billion in gross profit on sales of $16.2 billion last year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patent office review was the first of its kind under a
            new proceeding created by Congress to reconsider issued patents
            for finance-related business methods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAP successfully asked to have the review expedited, so the
            decision came six months after the process was instituted, said
            Steve Baughman of Ropes Gray in Washington, who also
            represented SAP. The law sets a one-year timeline, while a
            typical review under old rules could take years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a lawsuit filed in March against the patent office,
            Versata said its patent isn't for a financial product or service
            so shouldn't be subject to the new proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Versata Software Inc. v. SAP America Inc., 12-1029, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
            Federal Circuit
            (Washington). The lower court case is Versata Software Inc. v.
            SAP America Inc., 07cv153, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
            of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Receives $2.15 Billion From Teva, Sun Over Protonix &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and Sun Pharmaceutical
            Industries Ltd. (SUNP) will pay $2.15 billion to Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and a
            partner to settle litigation over unauthorized sales of the
            heartburn drug Protonix. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, will receive 64
            percent of the settlement while partner Takeda Pharmaceutical
            Co. will get the rest, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement
            yesterday. Teva will pay $1.6 billion, including $800 million
            this year and the rest in 2014, according to a company
            statement. Sun said it will pay $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased with today's settlement, which recognizes
            the validity and value of the innovation that led to Protonix,'
            Amy Schulman, Pfizer's general counsel, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva and Sun began selling generic versions in 2008 only to
            lose a challenge to a patent on the medicine two years later.
            Pfizer's Wyeth unit was seeking $2.7 billion from Teva and Sun,
            saying it was entitled to a share of the revenue from those
            generic versions, as well as compensation for sales it lost to
            the copycat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A trial over Pfizer's claims began June 3 in federal court
            in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased to put this matter behind us as we
            continue to focus on delivering safe and affordable medicines to
            patients around the world,' Richard Egosi, Teva's chief legal
            officer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case marked a rare instance in which a brand-drug
            company was seeking compensation for the early release of a copy
            of its medicines. Typically, generic-drug makers wait until the
            patents expire or they get a court ruling that clears the way.
            Teva has undertaken more than a dozen such at-risk market
            entries, betting that it would eventually win the case. It
            usually did. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the trial in Newark, Pfizer attorney William Lee told
            jurors that Teva and Sun were unwilling to wait until the patent
            expired on Protonix before they began selling their cheaper
            copies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They decided to take a risk,' said Lee in his opening
            statement on June 4. By starting generic sales, the market for
            branded versions of the drug was 'destroyed,' he said. ' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
            Inc., 04-cv-02355, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
            (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Barnes Noble Defeats Alexsam's Patent Infringement Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barnes Noble Inc. (BKS), the New York-based bookstore chain,
            didn't infringe a patent related to gift-card processing, a jury
            found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company and other retailers were sued in federal court
            in Marshall, Texas, in 2010 by Alexsam Inc., a Texas-based
            patent holder. Alexsam had sought money damages and court orders
            barring further unauthorized use of its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In May a jury rejected Barnes Noble's claims that the
            patents were invalid because the technology it covered wasn't
            new. The trial on Barnes Noble's alleged infringement of
            patent 6,189,787 followed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After a five-day trial, the jury on June 7 said the
            bookstore chain didn't infringe the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alexsam's claims against other remaining retailers will be
            heard later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Alexsam Inc. v. Barnes Noble Inc., 2:13-cv-00003-MHS-CMC, U.S. District Court, Eastern
            District of Texas
            (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;FIFA Says Brazil World Cup Soccer Trademark Abuse More Than 2010 &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soccer's governing body FIFA said it found more cases of
            intellectual property infringement related to next year's World
            Cup in Brazil than it did a year before South Africa hosted
            sports' most-watched event in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Auke-Jan Bossenbroek, FIFA's legal counsel responsible for
            protecting the Zurich-based organization's trademarks, said
            action has been taken in the past six months against about 100
            companies that don't have permission to use protected words or
            logos related to the World Cup, which kicks off in Rio de
            Janeiro June 12, 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FIFA and the local organizing committee have sold
            sponsorship rights to the monthlong event to 20 companies whose
            combined involvement is $1.4 billion through a mixture of direct
            cash payments and services. Coca Cola Co. (KO), one of FIFA's
            longest-tenured sponsors, is providing 5 million beverages for
            the tournament and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) will deliver 1,400 vehicles
            to transport officials and teams in 12 host cities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FIFA has been accused by small-business owners of being
            heavy-handed in its protection of rights at its flagship
            competition, which is responsible for about 90 percent of its
            income. Marketing Director Thierry Weil said FIFA has a
            responsibility to partners who have 'invested quite a
            significant amount of money to be part of the event.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FIFA has registered slogans including Brazil 2014 and Copa
            2014 as trademarks, and also the image of its current gold
            trophy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the majority of cases have been solved 'by a phone
            call,' Bossenbroek said, there have been instances of large
            corporations trying to use the popularity of the World Cup in
            marketing material and promotional activity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the 2010 tournament in South Africa, FIFA filed
            charges against organizers of an ambush marketing campaign for a
            Dutch beer brand during a match between the Netherlands and
            Denmark. FIFA's reaction to the incident, which featured about
            30 women wearing identical orange dresses, meant that Lieshout,
            Netherlands-based Bavaria, the company behind the stunt, got
            publicity for several days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many of the cases in Brazil have been the result of local
            businesses not understanding the rules related to using World
            Cup logos, Bossenbroek said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;University of Kansas Claums 'KUBoobs' Infringes Trademarks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The University of Kansas told the operator of an account
            with Twitter Inc.'s short-messaging service that products it
            promotes and its domain name infringe the school's trademarks,
            the Topeka Capital-Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The school was objecting to the use of its 'KU' trademark
            with the @KUBoobs Twitter account, the www.kuboobs.com domain
            name, and the sale of 'I heart KU Boobs' wristbands, according
            to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Twitter account solicited photographs of women's chests
            with something with a KU logo, saying these photos were a good
            luck ritual, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The school said the KUBoobs activities could potentially
            create unfair competition, and cause the public to believe,
            mistakenly, that some affiliation existed between the entities,
            according to the Capital-Journal. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Chinese National Gets 12 Years in Prison for Pirated Software &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Chinese national was ordered to serve 12 years in a U.S.
            prison for selling more than $100 million worth of software
            pirated from American companies, including Agilent Technologies
            Inc. (A), from his home in China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Xiang Li, 36, was sentenced June 11 in federal court in
            Wilmington, Delaware, after pleading guilty to copyright and
            wire fraud conspiracy charges in connection with software sales
            from his China-based website, prosecutors said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Li and his wife, of Chengdu, China, were accused of running
            a website called 'Crack 99' that sold copies of software for
            which 'access-control mechanisms' had been circumvented, the
            U.S. said in an unsealed 46-count indictment. The pair was
            charged with distributing more than 500 copyrighted works to
            more than 300 buyers in the U.S. and overseas from April 2008 to
            June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Li is the first Chinese citizen to be 'apprehended and
            prosecuted in the U.S. for cybercrimes he engaged in entirely
            from China,' prosecutors said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was hard for me to accept that Mr. Li deserved' a 12-year sentence for his actions, Mingli
            Chen, Li's lawyer, said in
            a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to court filings, Li was arrested by federal
            agents in June 2011 in Saipan, an island about 120 miles (193
            kilometers) northeast of Guam in the western Pacific Ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Li agreed to travel there from his home in southwest China
            to deliver pirated software and 20 gigabytes of proprietary data
            from a U.S. software company to undercover agents posing as
            businessmen, according court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pirated software included programs made by Santa Clara,
            California-based Agilent and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based
            Ansys (ANSS) Inc., prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in
            to sentence Li to more than 17 years in prison over the illegal
            software sales. Li will be deported to China once he serves his
            prison term, the government said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Li, 10-cr-112, U.S. District Court,
            District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;N.J. Tech Council Head Says Don't Halt Immigration Reforms &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The arrest June 5 of a foreign-born worker in a trade
            secrets case involving Becton Dickinson Co. (BDX) medical technology
            is no reason to derail immigration reform, the head of New
            Jersey's technology business trade group said, NJBiz reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Maxine Ballen, president and chief executive officer of the
            New Jersey Technology Council said such incidents are too rare
            to derail industry's need for foreign talent and the easing of
            restrictions on visas for skilled workers, according to NJ Biz. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She told NJBiz that companies can't afford to do without
            skilled workers from abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballen said that while she was 'appalled' at the recent
            arrest of an ex-BD employee, it is still important to increase
            rather than constrict the immigration pool, according to NJBiz. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sun Pharma Declines After $550 Million Pfizer Settlement</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP),
            India's biggest drugmaker by market value, fell the most in two
            weeks in Mumbai after agreeing to pay more than five times what
            it had provisioned to settle patent litigation with Pfizer Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sun shares declined 2.7 percent to 954 rupees as of 9:56
            a.m. local time, headed for the biggest loss since May 31, while
            the benchmark SP BSE Sensex Index dropped 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sun and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) will pay $2.15
            billion to Pfizer and a partner to settle litigation over
            unauthorized sales of the heartburn drug Protonix, Pfizer said
            in a statement yesterday. Sun will pay $550 million as
            settlement, the Mumbai-based company said, compared with the
            5.84 billion rupees ($100 million) it had set aside for the
            potential damages in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The cash which will go out is going to come from Sun
            Pharma's books, so to an extent, it's going to hold up their'
            expansion plans, said Hitesh Mahida, an analyst at Fortune
            Equity Brokers (India) Ltd. in Mumbai. 'They usually get a
            premium for their higher margins and high amount of cash.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sun and its group companies had 53.6 billion rupees of cash
            and short-term investments at the end of March, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Indian drugmaker will continue to sell in the U.S.
            pantoprazole, the drug ingredient in Protonix, Sun said.
            Pfizer's patent ended in January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer Ltd. (PFIZ), the Indian unit of New York-based
            Pfizer, (PFE) rose 1.8 percent in Mumbai trading. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer to AT&amp;amp;T Made Political Footballs in Shaky Recovery</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Amid the raft of multi-billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions this year, a new player has entered
            negotiations: politicians. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two Congressional committees are studying ATT Inc. (T)'s
            $48.5 billion takeover of DirecTV (DTV), while Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s $45.2 billion offer for Time Warner
            Cable Inc. (TWC) faced tough questioning last month at a House hearing. Politicians are also trying to crack
            down on overseas mergers intended to escape U.S. corporate taxes. Across the Atlantic, U.K. lawmakers fought
            Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s shelved $118 billion offer for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), and their French counterparts have
            challenged General Electric Co. (GE)'s $17 billion bid for Alstom SA (ALO)'s power assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
            the U.S. and Europe struggle with weak job creation and stalled wages, lawmakers are increasingly injecting
            themselves into announced mergers by raising concerns over layoffs or industries dominated by a few huge
            companies. Such attempts are putting some of the biggest transactions under the magnifying glass, and are
            likely to become more common, especially in high-profile industries like telecommunications and healthcare.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Once in a blue moon, takeovers do spill into the public consciousness, and in terms of
            doing deals it completely changes the dynamics,' said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London at law firm
            Sidley Austin LLP. 'There's no doubt that we are in a wave of popular debate or outrage.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Cellectis Surges as Pfizer Buys In to Novartis Challenge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cellectis (ALCLS) shares rose 76 percent,
            the most ever, after Pfizer Inc. (PFE) bought rights to the French
            company's experimental CAR-T projects, following Novartis AG (NOVN)
            into a new area of cancer immune therapy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer will give Cellectis $80 million upfront, plus
            milestone payments of as much as $185 million for each product
            that hits certain development and commercial targets, the
            drugmakers said in a statement today. New York-based Pfizer also
            agreed to buy about 10 percent of the French biotechnology
            company's capital through newly issued shares at 9.25 euros
            apiece, 49 percent above yesterday's close. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cellectis gained the most since the stock began trading in
            2007, rising to 10.94 euros in Paris, giving the company a
            market value of 274 million euros ($372 million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal sets up a challenge between Pfizer and Novartis,
            the world's two biggest drugmakers. The Swiss company is already
            testing a CAR-T therapy, which involves taking T cells from
            blood, engineering them to identify proteins on cancer cells,
            then putting them into the body to seek and destroy a tumor.
            Technology from Cellectis will simplify the delicate process of
            engineering those cells, Pfizer said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The project is 'an important step toward realizing the
            full potential of this technology in harnessing the body's own
            immune system to fight cancer,' Andre Choulika, chairman and
            chief executive officer of Cellectis, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bezos Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Juno Therapeutics Inc., founded last year, is also testing
            drug candidates with a similar approach. The U.S. biotechnology
            company counts Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos among its
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Immune oncology is a very hot segment,' Arnaud Guerin, a
            Nantes, France-based analyst at Portzamparc Societe de Bourse,
            said in a telephone interview. 'Everybody wants to be here. But
            it's a very risky area.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CAR-T technology developed by Cellectis hasn't been
            tested in people yet, Guerin said, so it's difficult to assess
            whether the project will be a success. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer will pay research and development costs for targets
            in the collaboration, and Cellectis is also eligible for tiered
            royalties. The Paris-based company will open a site in the U.S.
            to work more closely with Pfizer scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CAR-T refers to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell
            immunotherapies. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Loses Top Court Bid for Shield From Asbestos Suits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
            shield Pfizer Inc. (PFE) from some asbestos lawsuits connected to its
            Quigley Co. subsidiary, a bankrupt unit that stopped most
            operations in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The justices today rejected Pfizer's appeal of a ruling
            that opened the New York-based drugmaker to some claims related
            to Quigley, which made asbestos-containing products for the
            steel industry from the 1940s to the 1970s. Pfizer acquired
            Quigley in 1968. Asbestos, once widely used an insulator, was
            later shown to cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, contended that
            Quigley's bankruptcy proceedings insulated the parent company
            from suits filed under Pennsylvania state law by the Baltimore
            law firm of Peter Angelos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm began suing Pfizer in Pennsylvania state courts in
            1999, saying the company was legally responsible for some claims
            because its logo appeared on Quigley products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer says it played no role in making or selling the
            Quigley products. A federal appeals court in New York said the
            claims against Pfizer could go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Obama administration urged the high court to reject
            Pfizer's appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
            Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Law Offices of Peter Angelos,
            12-300. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Animal Health Stock Exchange Offer Has Too Many Takers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the
            world's biggest drugmaker, oversubscribed to a program to
            exchange some or all of their shares for those of its former
            animal-health unit, Zoetis Inc. (ZTS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer will retire about 405 million shares, or about $11.4
            billion worth, at today's price, as investors tried to exchange
            more Pfizer shares than there was Zoetis stock. Shareholders
            will get 24 percent of the 1.68 billion shares tendered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The share exchange completes the New York-based company's
            restructuring plan, in which it dropped two non-drug units, the
            animal health business and an infant nutrition line. Zoetis
            began trading as a separate company on February 1, surging 19
            percent in its debut after raising $2.24 billion in an initial
            public offering. As a result of the spinoff completion, the
            company expects adjusted earnings of $2.10 to $2.20 a share,
            from a previous projected range of $2.14 to $2.24, according to
            its statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer offered investors the Zoetis stock at a 5.4 percent
            discount. For every $100 of Pfizer stock traded in, they'll get
            $105 of Zoetis shares in return, which Pfizer gave as an
            incentive to participate in the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zoetis is based in Florham Park, New Jersey, and makes and
            sells drugs and treatments for animals. Livestock products make
            up 65 percent of its sales, while medicines for pets account for
            the rest. Much of the company's growth depends on rising wealth
            levels around the world, as people eat more meat and care for
            companion animals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Board Appointment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company today also said it appointed Michael McCallister, a former chief executive officer at
            the Louisville,
            Kentucky-based health insurer Humana Inc. as Zoetis's non-executive chairman. He replaces Chief Financial
            Officer Frank D'Amelio, who will remain on the Zoetis board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zoetis shares fell 1.8 percent to $30.05 at 10:25 a.m. in
            New York. Pfizer declined by less than 1 percent to $28.20 &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Ian Read is now deciding whether to
            split the company in two to separate its generic drug's
            business. The split could happen in the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley managed the deal. Skadden, Arps,

        <headline>Pfizer's Quigley Can End Nine-Year Bankruptcy, Judge Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s non-operating Quigley
            Co. can end almost nine years in bankruptcy under a plan that
            will resolve most asbestos claims against the world's largest
            drugmaker and its former maker of insulation products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in Manhattan today
            approved a Chapter 11 plan under which Pfizer will contribute
            assets worth $964 million. He rejected a prior plan almost three
            years ago, saying Pfizer was improperly using Quigley's
            bankruptcy to shield itself from asbestos claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernstein found in September 2010 that Pfizer's proposed
            $216.2 million contribution to a prior plan wasn't enough
            considering court testimony that Quigley may face $4.45 billion
            in claims over 42 years, and that asbestos claimants could have
            fared better by suing the company under civil tort law. A
            company reorganizing in bankruptcy is shielded from lawsuits,
            including tort, or wrongful-injury claims. Once it emerges, it
            is a new legal entity, and often can no longer be sued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quigley, which made asbestos-containing products from the
            1940s to the 1970s, including Insulag, a powdered insulation,
            was bought by Pfizer in 1968. It stopped most operations in 1992
            and filed for bankruptcy in 2004, facing 160,000 lawsuits. Many
            also named Pfizer, whose name appeared on Insulag packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said throughout the case that it never made or
            sold Quigley's products and it doesn't have liability for them.
            Asbestos, once widely used as an insulator, was later shown to
            cause cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Objection &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog for the Justice
            Department, sought to have the case thrown out in 2010, saying
            that while it's pending, creditors with alleged asbestos-related
            health problems have been unable to sue New York-based Pfizer,
            and many have died. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wilentz, Goldman Spitzer was the sole objector to the
            current plan. The Woodbridge, New Jersey-based law firm called
            it yet another flawed plan after 'nine years of afflicted
            deals' in which Pfizer has tried to buy votes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-bk-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The appeals
            case is 11-2635, 11-2767, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
            Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Failure Gives AbbVie Lessons in Pursuit of Shire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), in its pursuit of
            drugmaker Shire Plc (SHP), has hired some of the same advisers that
            Pfizer Inc. worked with in its failed push for AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN)
            They're trying to learn from the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie's chief executive officer,
            yesterday made clear that a hostile bid is an option for his
            company, a move Pfizer ruled out. AbbVie's effort also differs
            in that it's appealing directly to Shire shareholders early,
            offering what it calls a significant premium to win their
            support to pressure its board or prepare the ground for a
            hostile offer, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's boom in health-care takeovers is giving
            companies and their banks, lawyers, and public-relations firms
            plenty of real-life experience to draw upon. AbbVie is being
            advised on its $46.5 billion bid by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) as well
            as PR firm Brunswick Group, both of which also worked with
            Pfizer on AstraZeneca. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They don't want to back themselves into a corner,' Navid Malik, an analyst at Cenkos Securities
            Plc in London, said of
            AbbVie. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gonzalez's team is trying to keep debate focused on the
            strategic logic of a deal, rather than on using Shire's Irish
            legal domicile to escape U.S. taxes -- a topic that came to
            dominate the Pfizer-AstraZeneca transaction, said one of the
            people, who asked not to be identified because talks are
            private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;However, they're also stressing that tax benefits could
            enable bigger payouts to investors in the future. The pitch:
            that a combination would enrich Shire shareholders beyond what
            the company could achieve alone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shire, for its part, has said the bid undervalues the
            company, and that it has strong prospects on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for AbbVie and a spokesman for Brunswick
            didn't immediately return calls seeking comment. A JPMorgan
            spokeswoman declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie heads into possible
            negotiations with advantages Pfizer lacked. Unlike AstraZeneca,
            Shire doesn't have a large workforce or substantial research
            base in the U.K. that politicians will fight to keep under local
            control, as they did in AstraZeneca's case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No History &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;And AbbVie, spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) last year,
            has no history of past acquisitions to defend. Pfizer's record
            of presiding over large-scale layoffs after buying companies
            including Wyeth and Pharmacia Corp. helped rally British
            politicians and unions to AstraZeneca's side. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shire, domiciled in Dublin for tax purposes and with
            management offices in Basingstoke, England, has rejected three
            takeover offers from AbbVie. The companies are at odds over how
            to benchmark Shire's shares, with AbbVie arguing Shire's share
            price has been inflated since the AstraZeneca deal highlighted
            the attractiveness of U.K. and Irish-domiciled health-care
            companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche Bank AG, Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR),
            Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are advising Shire. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Final Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AbbVie CEO Gonzalez's statement yesterday that he would
            keep a hostile bid on the table contrasted with Pfizer's
            approach. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer on May 18 said its latest $117 billion proposal for
            AstraZeneca was final and that it wouldn't try to woo
            shareholders directly. Under U.K. takeover rules, deeming an
            offer final makes it nearly impossible for it to be further
            increased. That's another pitfall AbbVie is keen to avoid, two
            of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those pledges marked the end -- at least for now -- of what
            would have been the industry's biggest-ever acquisition, raising
            questions about Pfizer's tactics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Parliament's Reaction &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, AbbVie is trying to head off concerns that set
            off a heated public debate over AstraZeneca, one of the people
            familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Members of Parliament in the U.K. expressed reservations
            over Pfizer's history of large transactions followed by firings
            and the shutdown of research facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In response, Pfizer promised to locate 20 percent of its
            global research workforce in Britain. That in turn fuelled
            concern from public officials in the U.S. and Sweden, where
            AstraZeneca also has significant operations, and exacerbated
            animosity between the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shire employs fewer than 500 people in the U.K. and only
            about 100 in Ireland. CEO Flemming Ornskov and Phil Vickers,
            Shire's research head, work in the U.S., and other top managers
            are joining them there. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a message to its employees yesterday, AbbVie said no
            jobs would be lost in the Chicago area in a Shire deal, and the
            combined company would be managed from there. AbbVie is also
            arguing that a deal would strengthen Shire's research and
            development capacity and give it global scale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Political Scrutiny &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buying Shire would give AbbVie a growing stable of
            treatments for rare diseases. The U.S. company is dependent on
            the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira for about 60 percent of
            sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gonzalez yesterday stressed the strategic advantages he
            believes a transaction would bring to both companies in areas
            such as rare diseases, neurosciences and ophthalmology. He also
            pointed to the common ground between AbbVie and Shire. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Both strategically and culturally, there is great
            alignment between our companies,' he said. They 'are both
            specialty-focused biopharmaceutical companies, pursuing similar
            strategies, targeting diseases of high unmet medical need.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While AbbVie has said the proposed deal would cut its tax
            rate by almost 10 percentage points, in its 39-page slide deck
            presentation to Shire investors the word 'tax' surfaces only
            on page 20. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Announces $10 Billion Share Repurchase Program</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, said it will buy back $10 billion in stock after
            earlier this week announcing it will retire about $11.4 billion
            in shares through the spinoff of its animal-health unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The buyback is the fourth major share repurchase program
            for New York-based Pfizer in the past 2 1/2 years. During that
            time, the company has announced $39 billion in share buybacks,
            including today's. Pfizer has $3.9 billion left on its current
            repurchase program, the company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ian Read, Pfizer's chief executive officer, has said that
            share repurchases are the best uses of Pfizer's cash, compared
            with acquisitions or increasing the dividend. Read has shed non-drug units to focus on developing and
            selling new, brand-name
            therapies. The company, which had a market capitalization of
            about $200 billion as of today's close, is looking at whether it
            will split itself and get rid of its generics drug business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer earlier this week announced the completion of a deal
            to exchange shares of its own stock for equity in Zoetis Inc. (ZTS),
            its former animal-health unit. That exchange is expected to
            retire about $11.4 billion in Pfizer shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares gained 1.4 percent to $28.58 in extended
            trading at 5:35 p.m. New York time after the buyback was
            announced. The company's stock has increased 25 percent in the
            past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Sues Teva, Mylan to Delay Generic Celebrex Until 2015</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) said it filed patent-
            infringement lawsuits today against generic-drug makers
            including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) to prevent them
            from selling a low-cost version of the painkiller Celebrex until
            December 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer had won a ruling in 2008 that prevents Teva from
            entering the market until May 2014. In that case, an appeals
            court invalidated a patent that expires in December 2015. Pfizer
            said today it had persuaded the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
            to reissue that patent with changes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Celebrex, also known by the active ingredient celecoxib,
            generated $1.75 billion in U.S. sales last year, the company
            said Jan. 29. Each day that Pfizer can delay generic competition
            means about $5 million in revenue for the New York-based
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reissued patent covers methods of treating
            osteoarthritis with celecoxib. In addition to Petach Tikva,
            Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic-drug maker,
            Pfizer said it sued Mylan Inc., Actavis Inc. (ACT), Lupin Ltd. (LPC) and
            Apotex Inc. in federal court in eastern Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Continued development of new medicines that enhance
            patient lives is supported by protecting intellectual property
            and innovation,' Pfizer General Counsel Amy Schulman said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, faces competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill
            Celebrex in May after a federal judge invalidated a patent that
            would have extended protection through December 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and Lupin
            Ltd. (LPC) were among the generic-drug makers who successfully argued
            that New York-based Pfizer's patent wasn't different enough from
            the one expiring in May. Pfizer 'will pursue all available
            remedies, including an immediate appeal of the court's
            decision,' the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
            inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
            chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
            medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
            and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
            sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
            launching early,' said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
            Sanford C. Bernstein Co. Pfizer's earnings per share will be
            cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
            make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;

            court ruling that invalidated a patent covering the method of
            treating osteoarthritis with the active ingredient in Celebrex. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Virginia ruled yesterday that a

            patent's validity. New York-based Pfizer had sued manufacturers
            after they filed applications to produce generic forms of the
            drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is G.D. Searle LLC v. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc.,

            coffee brewing systems, lost its appeal of a lower-court ruling
            in a patent-infringement case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Washington-based appeals court ruled yesterday that the
            lower court properly found that JBR Inc.'s One Cup single-serve
            containers didn't infringe a Keurig patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In May, a federal judge in Boston said the designs of
            containers by Waterbury, Vermont-based Keurig and JBR were
            dissimilar. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed that

        <headline>Pfizer Seen Facing Celebrex Copies in May on Patent Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, faces competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill
            Celebrex in May after a federal judge invalidated a patent that
            could have delayed generic versions of the medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A patent expiring in December 2015 was invalid because it
            wasn't different enough from one ending in May, a federal judge
            in Norfolk, Virginia, said yesterday in a victory for companies
            including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and
            Lupin Ltd. (LPC) Pfizer 'will pursue all available remedies,
            including an immediate appeal of the court's decision,' the
            company said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
            inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
            chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
            medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
            and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
            sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
            launching early,' said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
            Sanford C. Bernstein Co. Pfizer's earnings per share will be
            cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
            make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There would be little to no impact to EPS from 2016
            onwards because we have already been modeling generics in late
            2015,' Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 1.4 percent to $31.98 yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reimburse Pfizer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Actavis Plc (ACT) said it plans to begin selling a generic
            Celebrex in May, as long as it gets regulatory approval. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva,
            Israel-based Teva, said
            the company is pleased with the decision. Officials with Mylan
            didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Should the generic-drug companies enter the market and
            later lose the appeal, they could be ordered to reimburse Pfizer
            for any profits it loses from the low-cost competition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An appeals court in 2008 had invalidated the patent, saying
            it just covers a method of administering a 'therapeutically
            effective amount' of the compounds covered by the patent that
            ends in May. New York-based Pfizer asked the patent office to
            reissue it with modifications to work around the appeals court
            decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;District Judge Arenda Wright Allen said that the
            modification sought by Pfizer wasn't allowed under the law, so
            the Federal Circuit's reasoning stands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is G.D. Searle LLC v. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
            13cv121, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
            Virginia (Norfolk). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Neway Valve (Suzhou) Co. (603699) of China
            was accused in a lawsuit brought by the state of Oklahoma of
            competing unfairly through the use of unlicensed software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Neway competed unfairly with other valve makers including
            Oklahoma City-based Kimray Inc. by under-licensing software for
            use in its business, according to the complaint filed in
            Oklahoma state court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The state said that although the company may have as many
            as 1,400 desktop computers in its Chinese facilities, it has
            bought fewer than 400 software licenses and the law requires one
            license per computer. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest drugmaker, faces
            competition to its $3 billion arthritis pill Celebrex in May

            &lt;p&gt;Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK), the online discount retailer, won
            dismissal of two lawsuits brought by firms that specialize in
            acquiring patents to obtain royalties from other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overstock, based in Salt Lake City, said in a statement
            yesterday that after it pledged not to settle the infringement
            cases, the plaintiffs, which it described as 'patent trolls,'
            'just walked away.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The term 'patent troll' is sometimes used to disparage
            companies that don't make the products covered by the patents
            they own and instead sue others for infringement to force a cash
            settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One suit, brought by Eclipse IP LLC in April, accused
            Overstock of infringing three patents. That case was dismissed
            Feb. 24, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The other suit was brought in May 2012, alleging that
            Overstock infringed a single patent. Plaintiff Execware LLC
            dropped that case in a March 7 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are Eclipse IP LLC v. Overstock.com Inc., 2:13-cv-00293, U.S. District Court, Eastern

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. sued Torrent
            Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (TRP) in a bid to block sales of a generic
            version of erectile-dysfunction drug Viagra while the largest
            U.S. drugmaker's patent is still in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Torrent is seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
            Administration for generic Viagra, also known as sildenafil
            citrate, before Pfizer's U.S. patent expires on Oct. 22, 2019,
            according to a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer reported $1.88 billion in Viagra sales in 2013, or
            3.6% of total revenue, according to Bloomberg data. Pfizer has
            sued other drug companies in the same court over similar claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company seeks an order permanently barring Ahmedabad,
            India-based Torrent, its officers, agents and employees from
            'making, using, selling, selling, marketing, distributing or
            importing' the allegedly infringing drug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. reached a
            settlement that permits the Israeli drugmaker to market a
            generic version of Viagra in the U.S. on Dec. 11, 2017, or
            earlier under certain circumstances, New York-based Pfizer said
            in December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Planning to Raise AstraZeneca Bid Above $106 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. is preparing to sweeten its bid for AstraZeneca Plc to more than 63 billion pounds
            ($106 billion) in an attempt to lure the U.K.'s second-biggest drugmaker to the negotiating table, people
            with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The offer may value AstraZeneca at more than 50
            pounds a share and include a larger cash component, and could come as early as next week, said the people,
            who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The London-based company rejected a
            cash-and-stock proposal of 46.61 pounds a share. Pfizer will report its earnings on May 5. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            new bid and its timing aren't final and may change, two of the people said. After speaking with some
            AstraZeneca shareholders, Pfizer sees an offer in the low 50 pound-per-share range gaining their support for
            the companies to hold talks, two people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
            is on a charm offensive in the U.K. this week and would prefer to negotiate a friendly deal. Buying
            AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca
            rose 3.2 percent to 4,815 pence a share in London today, giving it a market value of 60.8 billion pounds.
            Pfizer fell 0.4 percent to $31.15. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies have several large investors in common,
            including BlackRock Inc., Wellington Management Co. and Vanguard Group Inc. Pfizer's top-20 shareholders
            collectively own 27.6 percent of AstraZeneca, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Government Meetings
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Until we see something officially, there is no comment we can provide,' said Esra
            Erkal-Paler, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman. Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's earlier offer, made in January, valued AstraZeneca at 58.8 billion pounds. The proposed
            deal would be the largest ever in the drug industry and the biggest of a U.K. company, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read met with U.K. government ministers April 29 to discuss a potential
            takeover, according to a person familiar with the meetings. The CEO emphasized the American company's plans
            to carry out research, development and manufacturing in the U.K. as well as the appeal of the British tax
            system, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global Company &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;British lawmakers this
            week mobilized against Pfizer's attempt, demanding Business Secretary Vince Cable secure assurances on jobs
            and research investment. Part of Pfizer's pitch to British skeptical officials and media is that AstraZeneca
            is a global company and has substantial operations and people outside the country, said one of the people.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 40 percent of AstraZeneca's revenue in 2013 came from North America, and another
            34 percent from outside of Europe, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Chairman
            Leif Johansson said the drugmaker will return to growth as an independent company and listed the reasons for
            rejecting the Pfizer offer, in a video today. The bid 'significantly undervalued' the company and it's
            concerned that the offer was too heavily weighted in stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's pursuit of
            AstraZeneca is eclipsing a deal announced April 22 by Novartis AG of Basel, Switzerland, and GlaxoSmithKline
            Plc. Novartis agreed to buy Glaxo's cancer business for as much as $16 billion, form a consumer-health joint
            venture with Glaxo, sell its veterinary unit to Eli Lilly Co. for $5.4 billion and sell most of its vaccines
            business to Glaxo for as much as $7.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Pfizer Bid for AstraZeneca Faces Obstacles From Target</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer (PFE) Inc.'s $106 billion bid for
            AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) faces increased resistance as the unwilling
            target's chairman listed the reasons the offer was rejected and
            British lawmakers began efforts to block the buyout attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer 'significantly undervalued' AstraZeneca,
            Chairman Leif Johansson said today in a video posted to the
            company website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, offered 46.61 pounds a
            share in cash and stock in January, and London-based AstraZeneca
            declined to pursue negotiations. On April 28, Pfizer made the
            offer public and said it wanted to restart discussions.
            AstraZeneca was also concerned that the offer was too heavily
            weighted in stock, and about the proposed tax structure of the
            new entity, Johansson said in the four-minute video. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'AstraZeneca has a clear innovation-based strategy,
            focused on achieving scientific leadership and returning to
            growth,' he said. 'The board is also confident in our ability
            to successfully execute that strategy as an independent
            company.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal may run into barriers set by U.K. officials
            worried about the loss of jobs and research investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer executives likely will be summoned before
            parliament's Business Committee to explain their intentions,
            Adrian Bailey, the committee's chairman, said April 29.
            Yesterday, Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat member of
            parliament, submitted a motion calling for ministers to 'act as
            necessary to protect employment and skills in the U.K.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Largest Takeover &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a great deal at stake here,' Huppert said in a
            statement. 'This would be the largest takeover of a British
            firm. I want to make sure AstraZeneca retains its position in
            the U.K. It is extremely important for those people employed by
            the company and our economy generally.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of Pfizer's offer, a deal would create a
            company incorporated in the U.K. for tax purposes and run out of
            New York, where Pfizer is based. The U.S. company has until May
            26 to make an offer for AstraZeneca, or say that it won't bid,
            under U.K. takeover rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On a conference call with reporters, Pfizer Chief Executive
            Officer Ian Read said he wouldn't commit to preserving British
            jobs, although he added the U.K. was an attractive jurisdiction
            in which to do business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shares have climbed 32 percent since Jan. 1.
            That growth shows that shareholders have endorsed the company's
            strategy, Johansson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 1.1 percent to 4,715.50 pence at 11:37 a.m.
            in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read met with U.K. government ministers April 29 to discuss
            a potential takeover, according to a person familiar with the
            meetings. Read emphasized the American company's plans to carry
            out research, development and manufacturing in the U.K. as well
            as the appeal of the British tax system, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's reputation in Parliament isn't helped by its 2011
            decision to close a research hub in the coastal town of
            Sandwich, southeast England, with the loss of 2,000 jobs.
            AstraZeneca is moving to a new global headquarters and research
            center in Cambridge, which is represented by Huppert. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bailey's committee will discuss on May 6 whether to hold
            hearings with executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I view it with great concern,' Bailey, who is a Labour
            lawmaker, told reporters. 'We have a company which closed its
            operations in Sandwich for tax purposes and now says it's buying
            a British company for tax purposes.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the bid goes ahead and is subject to a European
            Commission investigation, the U.K. may ask for it to be referred
            back on public interest grounds, at which point ministers could
            block it. Or the government could try to amend the Enterprise
            Act, which allows ministers to intervene to protect national
            security, media plurality and the stability of the financial
            system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jean-Christophe Gray, spokesman for Prime Minister David
            Cameron, called AstraZeneca's research center in Cambridge 'a
            significant part of the U.K.'s developing science skill base.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Would you expect senior figures in government to take
            close interest? Of course,' Gray said in London today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AstraZeneca Snubs Pfizer Approach That U.K. Won't Block</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) rejected Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) sweetened takeover proposal, saying the 62.6
            billion-pound ($105.6 billion) offer fails to appreciate the value of the promising medicines under
            development by the U.K.'s second-biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cash-and-stock offer, which
            values AstraZeneca at about 50 pounds a share based on today's closing price for Pfizer, also still relies
            too heavily on equity, London-based AstraZeneca said in a statement. AstraZeneca earlier rejected a proposal
            of 46.61 pounds a share, announced April 28. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer's proposal would dramatically
            dilute AstraZeneca shareholders' exposure to our unique pipeline and would create risks around its
            delivery,' AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson said in the statement today. 'As such, the board has no
            hesitation in rejecting the proposal.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            U.K. Signals It Won't Block Pfizer's Bid for AstraZeneca
            Pfizer Planning to Raise AstraZeneca Bid Above $106 Billion
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca may not get much help from the government of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron in
            fending off Pfizer. The government today signaled it wouldn't interfere, rebuffing calls from members of
            other political parties to step in to protect jobs in the country's science base. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca
            declined less than 1 percent to 48.08 pounds in London. Pfizer fell 1.3 percent to $30.75 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;CEO Meetings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer raised its bid after Chief Executive Officer Ian Read met
            with AstraZeneca shareholders and government officials in the U.K. In a letter to Cameron, New York-based
            Pfizer pledged to follow through on AstraZeneca's plan to build a substantial campus in Cambridge, England,
            and to keep key scientific management at the site. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is ultimately a decision for
            AstraZeneca shareholders,' said Universities and Science Minister David Willetts in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has been in talks with Pfizer about preserving jobs, particularly in research
            and manufacturing, in the country, Willetts said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I think those messages are getting
            home to Pfizer, but there's a lot more hard-headed negotiation to come,' Willetts said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cameron
            spoke with Johansson today about the deal, said Jean-Christophe Gray, Cameron's spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'AstraZeneca
            has a fantastic role in the British economy,' Cameron told reporters today in Newcastle-Under-Lyme, England.
            'Action on any merger is a decision for both companies. We've sought and received robust assurances from
            Pfizer should the deal go ahead.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax Rate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buying AstraZeneca
            would give Pfizer a lower tax rate because the combined company would be a corporate resident of England.
            The company, which would maintain its head office in New York, also would gain a portfolio of experimental
            cancer drugs from the purchase. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca in its April 28 statement rejecting the
            initial offer said Pfizer's decision to move its tax domicile to the U.K. may be problematic. The U.K.
            company highlighted that issue again in today's statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's earlier offer, made
            in January, valued AstraZeneca at 58.8 billion pounds. The acquisition would be the largest ever of a U.K.
            company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and would create the world's biggest drugmaker by sales.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The consistent message from leading shareholders reinforces our belief that there is a
            highly compelling strategic, business and financial rationale for combining our businesses, with significant
            benefits for all our stakeholders,' Read said in a letter to Johansson. 'We believe our revised terms will
            be viewed by the market as a basis for engagement.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Mix &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stockholders
            would get 15.98 pounds in cash and 1.845 shares of the combined company for each share in AstraZeneca,
            Pfizer said. The new bid was 7.3 percent above the previous proposal and 39 percent above the closing price
            Jan. 3, before AstraZeneca made its initial offer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new proposal consists of about 32
            percent cash and 68 percent stock, versus about 30 percent cash and 70 percent stock in the original offer.
            AstraZeneca said April 28 the initial bid 'very significantly undervalued' the company, and said it was
            concerned that too much of the payment was in stock rather than cash. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Limited
            Commitment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, in the letter to Cameron, pledged to keep at least 20 percent of the
            combined company's research and development workforce in the U.K., retain 'substantial' manufacturing
            facilities at AstraZeneca's site in Macclesfield, England, and invite at least two AstraZeneca directors to
            join Pfizer's board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. company is committing to the steps for at least five
            years, though it could 'adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change,' according to
            the Pfizer statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca employs almost 2,000 people in Macclesfield, and the
            company is in the process of moving its corporate headquarters from London to Cambridge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Cadbury Experience Guides Cameron on Pfizer-AstraZeneca</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;In January 2010, four months before
            then Prime Minister Gordon Brown's election defeat, Kraft Foods
            Group Inc.'s takeover of candy maker Cadbury Plc was used by the
            Conservative opposition to portray a government that was out of
            touch with the British people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now in power and facing his own general election within the
            year, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron is seeking to
            avoid opening himself to a similar charge over Pfizer Inc.'s bid
            for London-based AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even as Pfizer's 63.1 billion-pound ($106.5 billion)
            sweetened offer for AstraZeneca was rejected, the government
            said it was pressing Pfizer for assurances on jobs and the
            U.K.'s place as a center for the life-sciences industry. The
            government will carefully weigh Pfizer's proposals to see
            'whether they offer sufficient protection of our priorities,'
            Cameron's office said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron's Conservative-led coalition is trying to strike a
            balance between leaving the decision to the companies'
            shareholders without government interference and securing
            safeguards for jobs and U.K. science. In doing so, it is being
            reminded of Northfield, Illinois-based Kraft's reversal of a
            pledge to keep open a Cadbury plant in Keynsham, southwestern
            England. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whether Pfizer's commitments are binding 'is a real
            issue,' Science Minister David Willetts said in an interview.
            'After the way in which Labour mishandled Kraft's takeover of
            Cadbury, we're very much aware of it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Electoral Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The AstraZeneca takeover bid is all the more sensitive to
            Cameron less than three weeks before his party contests local
            and European elections at which securing jobs will play a role.
            With a U.K. general election due in May 2015, the opposition
            Labour Party has upped the political pressure, accusing the
            premier of being 'in league' with Pfizer, which its business
            spokesman, Chuka Umunna, referred to as 'the beast.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Labour will try to get as much advantage out of it as
            possible but would be doing similar things if they were in
            power,' Steve Fielding, who teaches politics at the University
            of Nottingham, said in an interview. That said, 'if people
            start losing their jobs, then Labour will say 'we did warn
            you,'' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron's office yesterday welcomed a letter to the prime
            minister from Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read,
            describing it as 'a positive sign with significant undertakings
            on research, jobs and investment.' In it, Read pledged to set
            up the company headquarters in the U.K., complete a planned
            AstraZeneca science hub in Cambridge, eastern England, and
            protect jobs in Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Plant Pledge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Cadbury agreed to be sold to Kraft for 11.7
            billion pounds, creating the world's largest confectionery
            company. Business Secretary Peter Mandelson was accused by the
            opposition of failing to stand up for British workers after
            Kraft went back on its pledge to keep open a Cadbury plant with
            400 workers in Keynsham. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kraft's Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld said in
            September 2009, at the beginning of the unsolicited takeover,
            that she believed the Keynsham plant could be kept open, only to
            announce seven days after her company's offer was made
            unconditional, that it would close. The U.K.'s takeover panel
            reprimanded the company for misstating its plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter Luff, a Conservative lawmaker and then chairman of
            the House of Commons Business Committee, said at the time he was
            'left with the uncomfortable feeling that politicians in these
            circumstances can't do anything except talk.' He compared
            Mandelson to Shakespeare's King Lear,'fulminating against the
            winds but without any control over those winds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Benevolent Employer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded by John Cadbury in 1824 in Birmingham, central
            England, Cadbury built a reputation as a benevolent employer
            after John's sons Richard and George opened a 'factory in a
            garden' in 1879 and provided housing, education facilities and
            sports fields for their staff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rosenfeld, in a letter to Mandelson, pledged to 'proceed
            with sincere respect for Cadbury's heritage and identity,'
            Mandelson told lawmakers on Luff's committee in January 2010. He
            rejected calls from lawmakers in his then governing Labour Party
            for new powers to stop such mergers and said he would meet with
            Kraft to 'hear how Kraft will fulfill the commitments they made
            to Cadbury and its workforce.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Cameron's favor is the fact that AstraZeneca, while it
            is Britain's second biggest pharmaceutical company, does not
            enjoy the same household status as Cadbury, maker of chocolate
            Creme Eggs and Dairy Milk bars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For most people in the U.K., Cadbury 'was an issue that
            had a resonance because they'd heard of the product,' said
            Fielding. 'AstraZeneca is not a name people talk about down the
            pub.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cameron, who received a letter from Pfizer and spoke with
            AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson today, 'is clear that the
            U.K. government regards the potential takeover bid as a matter
            for the respective boards and shareholders of the two
            companies,' the prime minister's office said in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government 'is determined' to secure jobs in life
            sciences and the letter ''is a positive sign with significant
            undertakings on research, jobs and investment,'' Cameron's
            office said. The government will now weigh the proposals to see
            ''whether they offer sufficient protection of our priorities,''
            it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The comments suggest that Pfizer Chief Executive Officer
            Ian Read has given the government enough confidence to face down
            mounting political opposition to the deal among members of
            Cameron's Conservative Party and opposition Labour lawmakers.
            AstraZeneca rejected New York-based Pfizer's increased offer as
            inadequate today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Getting Home' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;''We've had very tough-minded conversations with Pfizer,'
            Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said in a
            telephone interview. 'We've emphasized the importance of RD,
            the importance of manufacturing, the importance of having high-level management in the U.K. if this deal
            goes ahead. I think
            those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there's a lot
            more hard-headed negotiation to come.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its letter to Cameron, Pfizer pledged to set up its
            headquarters in the U.K., complete a planned AstraZeneca science
            hub in Cambridge, eastern England, and protect jobs in Britain.
            Pfizer also sweetened its bid for London-based AstraZeneca to
            about 63.1 billion pounds ($106.6 billion), an offer the company
            said failed to recognize the value of the promising experimental
            medicines under development. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chuka Umunna, Labour's business spokesman, accused the
            government of being 'in league' with Pfizer and said that for
            all the reassurances offered there is 'grave concern' the deal
            was driven by tax planning and would risk U.K. jobs and
            'intellectual asset stripping.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'The Beast' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The head of the beast, the central management of the new
            merged entity, will be in the U.S. They're simply seeking to be
            domiciled here for tax purposes,' he told BBC Radio 4. 'Do we
            really want of a jewel in the crown of British industry, our
            second biggest pharmaceutical firm, to basically be seen as an
            instrument of tax planning.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials at the Department for Business are examining how
            binding any commitments from Pfizer would actually be, according
            to a person familiar with internal discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Business Secretary Vince Cable, a member of Cameron's
            Liberal Democratic junior coalition partner, told the BBC the
            letter from Pfizer was 'encouraging, positive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Critics of Pfizer's bid for AstraZeneca cite Kraft Foods
            Inc.'s takeover of Britain's Cadbury Plc (CADBURY) in 2010. Cadbury agreed
            to be sold to Kraft for 11.7 billion pounds, creating the
            world's largest confectionery company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reputation Damaged &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before the deal, Kraft, based in Northfield, Illinois, said
            it would keep open a factory in Keynsham, southwest England.
            After the takeover was completed, Kraft announced it had decided
            to close the plant by 2011. A panel of lawmakers said Kraft
            damaged its reputation with its handling of the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's a real issue,' Willetts said, when asked how
            binding Pfizer commitments are. 'After the way in which Labour
            mishandled Kraft's takeover of Cadbury, we're very much aware of
            it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's takeover bid has become a political football as
            the parties highlight their differences less than a month before
            local elections and elections to the European Parliament. Both
            will be held on May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senior lawmakers from both the Conservatives and Labour
            weighed in against the deal today. Michael Heseltine, an adviser
            to Cameron on efforts to spur economic growth and a minister in
            Margaret Thatcher's administration, said the government should
            have powers to intervene against such a bid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are so many issues about the science base, about
            the supply chains, about employment prospects that ought to be
            explored and I don't see any way in which this can be adequately
            done unless the government has reserve powers,' Heseltine told
            the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Sainsbury, a Labour Party lawmaker in the House of
            Lords who was science minister under Tony Blair, called on
            Cameron to block the deal, telling the Financial Times that any
            promises from the company were 'frankly meaningless.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Miliband Tackles Cameron on Pfizer's Bid for AstraZeneca</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
            said Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) raised questions of
            'overriding national interest,' as the opposition Labour Party
            stepped up its rejection of the proposed takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Labour leader Ed Miliband accused Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday of promoting Pfizer's bid
            for London-based
            AstraZeneca. Cable later told reporters that reviewing rules on
            intervening in takeovers on public interest grounds was an
            option that the government was looking at. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parliament's Business, Innovation and Skills Committee will
            meet tomorrow to discuss whether to summon Pfizer executives.
            Chairman Adrian Bailey, a member of Miliband's Labour Party,
            told reporters on April 29 that it was likely they would do so,
            as the bid needed to be 'scrutinized very carefully.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Political attitudes to the bid are hardening less than
            three weeks before local and European elections even after
            AstraZeneca's board rejected Pfizer's 63.1 billion-pound ($106.5
            billion) sweetened offer on May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The British competition merger regime is non-political in
            the way it is applied, I think that's valued in that Britain is
            open in that respect,' said Cable, a member of Cameron's
            Liberal Democratic junior coalition partner. 'But there is an
            important national interest here that we have got to safeguard
            the protection of jobs and investment and particularly high
            technology research in pharmaceuticals.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Breakup Options Shift Even With AstraZeneca Bid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Since Ian Read became Pfizer Inc.'s
            leader, he's shed two non-drug businesses, reorganized the
            company into three separate units and pursued the largest merger
            in the history of the pharmaceutical industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now, even with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) in his sights as a takeover
            target, Read said he could theoretically see a time in the
            future when Pfizer splits into two parts to boost investor
            value, potentially making a proposed mega-company short lived. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not talking about a three or four-way split, we're
            talking about two major segments,' said Read, 60, a native of
            Scotland who started his career at Pfizer as an accountant and
            became chief executive officer in 2010, &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer never really thought of itself as three businesses,
            Read said on a conference call with investors and analysts
            today. It's a shift from last year, when the company began
            dividing the company into three units, each with its own leader.
            Read emphasized he's made no decision about a breakup. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 2.6 percent to $29.96 at the close in
            New York. The stock had gained 3.5 percent in the last 12
            months, the worst performance of any major brand drugmaker on
            the Standard Poor's 500 Pharmaceutical Index of 13 companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer last week offered about $106 billion to buy
            AstraZeneca Plc, a bid that was promptly dismissed by the
            London-based company. Along with the lower tax rate linked to
            AstraZeneca's U.K. base, Read has said the acquisition would
            give New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of
            experimental cancer drugs that use the body's own immune system
            to attack the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Seeking Efficiency &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Being bigger would also help Pfizer be more efficient,
            strengthen it in key drug development areas, and give the
            company more leverage against the governments and insurers
            buying its products, he said during the call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Immune-oncology is exciting, it's something to hang your
            hat on. But the tax stuff and the synergies are really where
            this lies,' said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones
            Co. based in Des Peres, Missouri. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal to buy AstraZeneca is being looked at closely by
            the U.K. government, over concerns it could reduce British
            pharmaceutical industry jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So far, it hasn't attracted nearly the same level of
            scrutiny in the U.S., where Read has said Pfizer will largely
            keep its operating headquarters even as it moves its legal
            residence to the U.K. for the lower tax rate. 'We clearly will
            stay with a massive presence in the U.S. with a combined
            company,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read declined to say when or if Pfizer might take its case
            directly to AstraZeneca shareholders in a hostile takeover
            attempt, though he hinted they might. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Considering Options' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to
            engage in conversations and believe it is in the best interests
            of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders that
            we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction,' Read said. 'We
            are considering our options on how we progress these
            discussions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two units inside Pfizer makes more sense than three, with
            half the company focused on brand-name drugs while the other
            part focuses on older products, Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It calls in the question why restructure into three unit
            instead of two in the first place,' Clark said by telephone.
            'They're tacking a bit more toward the center if they do
            acquire AstraZeneca.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read's comment followed a first-quarter report in which the
            company's profit beat analysts estimates while revenue fell
            short of analyst expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Estimates Beat &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earnings excluding one-time items were 57 cents a share, 2
            cents above the average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
            Revenue fell 9 percent to $11.4 billion as foreign exchange
            rates reduced sales by 3 percent, the company said in a
            statement today. Analysts expected $12.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Overall, a weak quarter with disappointing revenues,'
            said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein
            Co., who called it a 'low-quality' beat of earnings estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income fell 15 percent to $2.33 billion,
            or 36 cents, from $2.75 billion, or 38 cents, the company said.
            Pfizer said it would change its full-year earnings outlook,
            though wasn't permitted to do so now because of rules
            surrounding its offer to buy the U.K. drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer for the first time broke out separate financial
            results for the three units. Total first-quarter drug sales fell
            9 percent to $10.5 billion from a year earlier. Sales of
            Prevnar, Pfizer's pneumonia vaccine, were little changed at $927
            million. Viagra, a pill for erectile dysfunction, had sales that
            dropped 19 percent to $374 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The quarter's results were helped by a 11 percent reduction
            in cost of sales, which fell to $2.05 billion. Administrative
            expenses declined 6 percent to $3.04 billion, and research-and-development spending decreased 5 percent to
            $1.62 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer, AstraZeneca Called to Testify by U.K. Parliament</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmakers decided to call
            executives from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to testify on the proposed takeover
            of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), as London Mayor Boris Johnson added his
            voice to those urging caution on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives of London-based AstraZeneca will also be
            asked to appear before the House of Commons Business Committee,
            the panel said in an e-mailed statement after meeting in London
            today. Business SecretaryVince Cable, answering lawmakers'
            concerns in the House of Commons today, said the government is
            approaching the Pfizer bid from a position of neutrality. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from across Britain's political parties have
            raised questions about the offer of more than $100 billion and
            are pressing for assurances that New York-based Pfizer honors
            its pledge, made in a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron
            last week, that it will protect jobs and investment in
            pharmaceutical research and development in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would be very important to establish that Pfizer is
            genuinely committed to RD in this country,' Johnson, a member
            of Cameron's Conservative Party, told LBC Radio today. 'I
            believe in principle that we should have an open system of
            markets in this country, but when I look at something like
            AstraZeneca and I look at an organization of that scale, of its
            relative importance to the U.K. economy, the sheer percentage of
            its money that goes into RD, I think it is of great importance
            to Britain.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Union Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Labor unions Unite and the GMB asked for a meeting with
            Cable, a member of Cameron's Liberal Democrat coalition
            partners, to urge him to impose a 'national interest' test on
            the deal. They accused Cameron and Tory Chancellor of the
            Exchequer George Osborne of being supportive of the Pfizer bid
            while AstraZeneca workers have not been consulted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'AstraZeneca is a key player in the U.K.'s advanced
            manufacturing sector and as such is strategically important to
            the U.K., yet David Cameron and George Osborne seem comfortable
            waving the deal through, leaving any manufacturing strategy in
            tatters,' Unite Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke said in
            an e-mailed statement. 'The workforce and the unions have acted
            in a responsible manner and shown remarkable patience, but that
            is now wearing thin.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
            insisted the government is 'working hard within the constraints
            we have' to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
            science. He said European Union rules restrict the amount that
            government can intervene and British law only allows
            intervention on issues of national security, media plurality and
            banking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Even-Handed Neutrality' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government must and will approach this from a
            position of even-handed neutrality,' Cable said in Parliament.
            'I'm not ruling out intervention, we have to look at all the
            options open to us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron's spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, defended the
            prime minister's involvement and repeated the government's view
            that the final decision should rest with the companies'
            shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government's position is one of active engagement
            with both companies in terms of assessing the link to jobs and
            skills,' Gray told reporters in London today. 'The sole basis
            on which the government is engaging is with regard to
            underlining the importance we attach to continuing to expand the
            life-science sector in the U.K.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;AstraZeneca Defense &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, which last week rejected Pfizer's 62.6
            billion-pound ($106 billion) bid, said today that its plan for
            growth is working and it is aiming for annual revenues of more
            than $45 billion by 2023. The company highlighted drugs it has
            developed, including Brilinta and Farxiga, which it said will be
            the drivers of growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The increasingly visible success of our independent
            strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders,'
            Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement. 'These are
            benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca's
            shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cable praised AstraZeneca's plans and the company's
            investment in research and development of new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'AstraZeneca do have an ambitious and attractive long-term
            investment plan which we encouraged as part of the industrial
            strategy,' he said. 'We want to see it fulfilled.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Science Minister David Willetts will also testify to the
            House of Commons Science and Technology Committee about the
            government's involvement in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AstraZeneca Seeks to Show Strength Against Pfizer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the target of
            Pfizer's Inc.'s takeover bid of more than $100 billion, forecast
            long-term sales growth as the company seeks to convince
            investors that it can succeed as a standalone drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca will generate more than $45 billion in yearly
            revenue by 2023, following 'strong and consistent' growth
            starting in 2017, the London-based company said today in a
            statement. Its pipeline of drugs, led by lung and ovarian cancer
            treatments, could generate as much as $63 billion in peak-year
            sales, the company said. Revenue last year totaled $25.7
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca last week rejected a takeover bid by Pfizer of
            62.6 billion pounds ($106 billion) in a mix of cash and stock
            that valued the company at about 50 pounds a share. The offer
            failed to appreciate the promising medicines the company is
            developing, AstraZeneca said, and threatened to disrupt its
            progress. The pipeline is the product of a strategy announced
            last year to turn the company around, Pascal Soriot, who took
            over as chief executive officer in 2012, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Opposing 'Distraction' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Any distraction can suddenly have a negative impact,'
            Soriot told analysts and investors on a conference call. 'We
            are in a race with many of our competitors to get products into
            the marketplace. Any distraction that causes us to slow down, or
            any distraction that causes us to lose talent, can destroy
            value.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrew Widger, a spokesman in the U.K. for New York-based
            Pfizer, declined to comment on AstraZeneca's presentation today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca's expectations are 'ambitious, to say the
            least,' and rely on the ultimate approval of products that are
            high-risk, have unclear market potential or are in areas where
            the U.K. drugmaker lags behind competitors, according to
            Barclays Plc analysts, including Mark Purcell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are deeply skeptical of Astra achieving such a level
            of revenues,' Purcell and his colleagues wrote in a report to
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca fell 2.7 percent to 4,677 pence at the close in
            London. Pfizer declined 1.3 percent to $29.58 as of 12:34 p.m.
            in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Product Prospects &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Only 30 percent of the projected $45 billion in revenue in
            2023 stems from drugs in the pipeline, Soriot said. There is a
            low chance of success for any one drug, he said. In aggregate,
            products in the pipeline have a 36 percent chance of success and
            the company isn't relying on any of them, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I can't tell you what products will make it,' the CEO
            said. 'But I can tell you none of the products is more than 10
            percent of the pipeline.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from across Britain's political parties have
            raised questions about implications of Pfizer's potential
            takeover of AstraZeneca on jobs and pharmaceutical investments.
            Executives from the two drugmakers will also be asked to testify
            about the proposed acquisition, the House of Commons lawmakers
            Business Committee said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Unite and GMB labor unions asked for a meeting with
            U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable to urge him to impose a
            'national interest' test on the deal. They accused Prime
            Minister David Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, both Tories, of being supportive of
            the Pfizer bid
            while AstraZeneca workers haven't been consulted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Intervention 'Constraints' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
            said the government is 'working hard within the constraints we
            have' to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
            science. European Union rules restrict the amount that states
            can intervene in business transactions, and British law only
            allows intervention on issues of national security, media
            plurality and banking, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government must and will approach this from a
            position of even-handed neutrality,' Cable said in Parliament.
            'I'm not ruling out intervention. We have to look at all the
            options open to us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca reiterated that 2017 revenue will be in line
            with its 2013 sales. Analysts estimate its revenue falling to
            $24.3 billion in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growth will be driven by AstraZeneca's strength in diabetes
            and respiratory disease treatments, which may each bring in
            about $8 billion in sales in 2023, as well as Brilinta, a heart
            medicine that may garner about $3.5 billion. it said. Whether
            Brilinta meets that goal depends on winning approval of the drug
            for different uses, Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C.
            Bernstein Co., wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is also counting on increasing sales in
            emerging markets, including China, and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cancer Therapies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca said its investment in science is paying off,
            particularly in a line of cancer therapies that stimulate the
            body's immune system to fight off the disease, and its drugs are
            worth more than analysts predict. For example, AZD9291, a lung
            cancer medicine, could be worth $3 billion a year, compared with
            estimates of as much as $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Immuno-oncology is the therapeutic area that is getting
            the most investor attention now, but AZN will be a late entrant
            into the category and it is unclear how the company will compete
            effectively if there is no differentiation with its molecule,'
            Anderson wrote. 'It does have other immuno-oncology products
            also in development.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An experimental Alzheimer's treatment could be worth $5
            billion, compared with estimates of as much as $3 billion. That
            drug has about a 9 percent chance of success. Merck Co. (MRK), based
            in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, has a similar medicine in a
            more advanced stage of development, Anderson said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Cameron Says Pfizer 'Must Do More' for U.K. on AstraZeneca Bid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;David Cameron said Pfizer Inc.'s bid
            for AstraZeneca Plc 'must do more' for British jobs and
            science as the prime minister was challenged to intervene in the
            proposed takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a series of clashes in the House of Commons today,
            opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband urged Cameron to
            apply a public-interest test to the offer valued at more than
            $106 billion, the largest ever for a U.K. company, saying if he
            does not 'everyone will know he was acting as a cheerleader'
            for the bid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron said commitments made by Pfizer, including
            retaining at least 20 percent of the research and development
            workforce in the U.K., guaranteeing the completion of a new
            research campus at Cambridge, eastern England, and retaining a
            manufacturing base in Macclesfield, northern England, are
            'encouraging.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Let me be absolutely clear, I'm not satisfied, I want
            more,' Cameron said. 'The more we can do to strengthen the
            assurances the better.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
            to lawmakers on the proposed takeover next week. Ian Read of
            Pfizer and Pascal Soriot of AstraZeneca will appear before the
            Business, Innovation and Skills Committee on May 13 at 9:30 a.m.
            and then before the Science and Technology Committee on May 14
            at 9:15 a.m., according to statements from the panels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Questioned by reporters after the exchanges in Parliament,
            Cameron's spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, refused to expand on
            what assurances Cameron was seeking and any timetable for the
            talks. Cameron has not spoken to Pfizer, Gray said, adding that
            Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and Liberal Democrat
            Business Secretary Vince Cable had done so. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Deep Concern' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cable refused yesterday to rule out intervening in the bid.
            Miliband said today 'there is deep concern' about the deal as
            it would 'have an impact for decades to come on British jobs,
            British investment, British exports and British science.' He
            said his party would back using the public-interest test to slow
            down or halt the deal if it runs counter to British interests
            amid jobs concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government could amend the 2002 Enterprise Act within a
            month without significant difficulty to include the effect the
            takeover may have on the U.K.'s research and development base as
            one of the grounds for blocking the deal, according to the
            Labour Party. An independent body such as the Competition and
            Markets Authority could examine the proposed takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Playing Politics &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currently, U.K. rules only allow ministers to intervene to
            protect national security, media plurality and the stability of
            the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With U.K. national elections one year away today, British
            leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
            where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
            'strategic' from being bought. President Francois Hollande
            said yesterday that General Electric Co.'s proposed $17 billion
            acquisition of most of Alstom SA was 'not sufficient, so it's
            not acceptable' in its current form because of its impact on
            employment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron accused Miliband today of playing politics over the
            bid for AstraZeneca 'rather than backing the British national
            interest.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Has Cameron Channeling Hollande Amid Job Fears</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;British and French politicians have
            traditionally had diametrically opposed attitudes to takeovers
            of their corporate crown jewels by foreigners. In Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE)
            bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the difference is a lot smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer worth more than $106 billion, the largest ever
            for a U.K. company, prompted demands for guarantees on jobs,
            facilities, and retaining research work from Prime Minister
            David Cameron's Conservative-led coalition. Opposition Labour
            Party leader Ed Miliband called for a 'public-interest test'
            on major deals by foreign acquirers and Liberal Democrat
            Business Secretary Vince Cable said he might support one. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With U.K. national elections a year away today, British
            leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
            where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
            'strategic' from being bought, and the state rarely hesitates
            to get involved. President Francois Hollande said yesterday that
            General Electric Co.'s proposed $17 billion acquisition of most
            of Alstom SA (ALO) was 'not acceptable' in its current form because
            of its impact on employment. Cameron said today he's 'not
            satisfied' with the Pfizer offer so far. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Clear Message' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The U.K. government is reacting more strongly now to
            Pfizer's intention to take over AstraZeneca because they need to
            start sending a clear message to citizens that they are
            concerned about them as the next general election gets closer,'
            said Daniel Lacalle, a senior fund manager at Ecofin Ltd. in
            London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. politicians' attitudes reflect the anxieties of a
            country that's seen high-profile companies from carmakers to
            confectioners absorbed by foreign buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike in the U.S., Canada, France and Australia, British
            officials have no direct legal mechanism to halt foreign
            acquisitions -- an absence illustrated by Kraft Foods Inc.'s
            successful takeover of chocolate-maker Cadbury Plc in 2010 over
            the objections of lawmakers, with the subsequent closing of a
            factory in southwest England. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was probably too
            enthusiastic in quickly hailing the Pfizer bid, which would see
            the American company move its legal domicile to the U.K., as
            positive for the country and an endorsement of its corporate-tax
            regime, according to two government officials with knowledge of
            the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Legal Constraints' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron's government is now trying to show it is neutral by
            stressing that it's talking to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca, the
            people said on condition of anonymity because the talks are
            private. Cable told lawmakers yesterday the government is
            'operating within serious European legal constraints.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today, the prime minister told Parliament at his weekly
            question-and-answer session that evaluating the bid would
            include examining its impact on jobs and science in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The commitments that have been made so far are
            encouraging,' Cameron said. 'I'm not satisfied. I want more.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
            before the House of Commons Business and Science Committees over
            two days next week, the panels said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron, Cable and Osborne have Paris to look to for a
            recent example of navigating an unexpected offer from an
            American company. After Bloomberg News reported GE's Alstom bid
            on April 23, French officials led by Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg began a last-ditch effort to
            encourage a counterbid
            from Siemens AG. Even after securing guarantees on jobs and
            keeping French sites from GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Montebourg and
            Hollande said this week the American company's offer still isn't
            sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Outside Buyers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K.'s generally hands-off approach to deal making has
            helped make it more attractive than its neighbors to foreign
            acquirers. Buyers from outside Europe have spent about $358
            billion on deals in the U.K. over the last five years, not
            including AstraZeneca, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
            compares with just $86 billion in France and $114 billion in
            Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A takeover of AstraZeneca would be the biggest-ever
            acquisition of a U.K. company by value -- about five times
            bigger than the largest transaction of the past half-decade,
            Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA)'s $22 billion deal for U.K. broadband
            provider Virgin Media last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A deal would also mean ceding control of a large part of
            the country's pharmaceutical infrastructure. The London-based
            company has about 7,000 domestic staff, a major RD facility in
            Cambridge, eastern England, and a 2,900-employee global hub for
            cancer research outside Manchester in the north. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, based in New York, is very unlikely to proceed with
            a bid for AstraZeneca if it can't win the blessing of Cameron's
            government, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Difficult &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even in the absence of a direct mechanism to block the
            deal, the U.K. could make doing business much more difficult for
            Pfizer if it chose to, especially in an industry as heavily
            regulated as pharmaceuticals, the person said, asking not to be
            identified discussing private deliberations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to one Cameron aide, there are many more
            political risks for the government if the takeover goes ahead
            than if it collapses. As with previous deals in which the
            government has been involved, such as Lloyds TSB Group Plc's
            2008 rescue of HBOS Plc, ministers risk being criticized if job
            losses follow or the deal is seen as a failure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Cameron in a May 2
            phone call that even by engaging with Pfizer, the government
            risked being seen as supporting the takeover, according to a
            person familiar with the call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mayor's Concern &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Along with Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson, a possible
            candidate to succeed Cameron as Tory leader, has said he's
            concerned about AstraZeneca being in foreign hands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After meetings with U.K. officials, Pfizer has pledged to
            keep about 20 percent of the combined group's research staff in
            the U.K. for five years. That promise comes with a caveat,
            though: that Pfizer may have to 'adjust these obligations
            should circumstances significantly change,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both Cable and Miliband have said they're worried about
            Pfizer's commitment to those promises. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Britain's government is almost alone among major economies
            in having never in recent years scuttled a major foreign
            takeover. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government torpedoed
            the proposed merger of BAE Systems Plc (BA/) and what's now Airbus
            Group NV (AIR) in 2012, citing concerns over the loss of German
            control and jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In recent years Canada has blocked deals by BHP Billiton (BHP)
            Ltd. and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., although the latter was
            eventually approved. Australia intervened last year to stop the
            $2.9 billion acquisition of GrainCorp Ltd. by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Special Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While British politicians are clearly concerned about the
            Pfizer deal, its size and relevance to high-tech research make
            it a special case, said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London
            at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. For that reason the country isn't
            likely to 'go down the road to a more formalized test' for
            foreign deals, as in Canada and Australia, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's case isn't being helped by concerns it's moved to
            shut down research after past acquisitions, and by its decision
            in 2011 to close a lab in Sandwich in southeast England that
            cost about 2,000 jobs. Since it bought rival Wyeth in 2009, it's
            cut $4.6 billion in research spending and narrowed its
            scientific focus to six areas of medicine. Pfizer's plan to be
            domiciled in the U.K. for tax purposes would also give it a
            lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm sure these companies are motivated by hard-headed
            commercial considerations, and we should be motivated by hard-headed considerations of national interest,'
            Cable told
            lawmakers yesterday. 'We see the future of the U.K. as a
            knowledge economy, not a tax haven.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Governors Push Pfizer About Jobs in AstraZeneca Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The governors of Maryland and Delaware have asked Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer Ian
            Read whether jobs will be cut in their states after the drugmaker promised to keep people employed in the
            U.K. as a way to further a $100 billion-plus bid to buy AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the
            acquisition occurs, it would allow Pfizer to move its legal address from New York to the U.K. to gain a
            lower tax rate. Read told U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron that Pfizer would keep at least 20 percent of
            the combined company's research and development workers and substantial manufacturing facilities in the U.K.
            for at least five years to win support for the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read's U.K. commitment may boost
            pressure on Pfizer to reduce U.S. costs to obtain the savings needed from the deal. Since buying Wyeth in
            2009, Pfizer has cut $4.6 billion in research spending, announced plans to close at least seven labs and
            narrowed its scientific focus to six areas of medicine. During the past three years, the company lost patent
            protection on its best-selling drug Lipitor, divested its animal health business and reduced its workforce
            25 percent to 77,700 employees by the end of 2013, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter from
            the governors asked Read to detail potential job losses in the AstraZeneca deal and commit to continued
            investments in their states. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No Assurances &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Despite our requests,
            we have received no corresponding assurances about retaining jobs and research and development in our
            states,' Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and Delaware Governor Jack Markell, both Democrats, wrote in a
            letter obtained by Bloomberg News. 'Our concern is exacerbated by Pfizer's history of closing U.S. research
            facilities, including sites in Michigan and Illinois, after closing on previous corporate transactions.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer officials have spoken to the governors and understand their concerns, said Mackay
            Jimeson, a company spokesman. Bringing together the two companies would help create a leader in the
            pharmaceutical industry, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We believe a potential combination with AstraZeneca
            would build a stronger company by bringing together our assets, people and scientific expertise to create
            vibrant businesses with new potential growth and opportunities to meet patients' needs,' Jimeson said in an
            e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their letter, the governors included six questions, saying they wanted
            information to better understand how Pfizer's potential merger would affect their states and the role they
            play in the pharmaceutical industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Good People' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We have 2,600
            very good people in Delaware and 3,100 in Maryland,' Markell said by telephone. 'My job is to do everything
            I can do to make sure they have continued career opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca's North
            America headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The company has a research center in Gaithersburg,
            Maryland, and a manufacturing facility in Newark, Delaware. About 22 percent of 51,500 people London-based
            AstraZeneca employs worldwide work in the U.S., according to the company's website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also
            today, Democrats in the U.S. Senate said they may push legislation that would block companies from shifting
            their legal addresses overseas to reduce their tax bills. That effort runs counter to Read's April 28
            statement that he didn't believe an acquisition allowing the New York-based company to move its legal
            resident to the U.K. would 'create a conflict with the interest of the U.S. government.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Hollowing
            Out' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he is
            looking for a way to move quickly to prevent companies from 'hollowing out' the tax base by moving overseas
            in name only, while keeping their operating headquarters in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The response from
            the governors and lawmakers isn't surprising, Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University in
            New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'These tax inversions, they are like a 2x4
            into the face of Congress, saying pay attention to this,' Reinhardt said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The governors
            decided to act after reading the past week about the assurances Read had provided to the British government,
            Markell said. Their list included questions about how many jobs would be cut or relocated from Maryland and
            Delaware as a result of any transaction, about future investment in the states and plans for splitting a
            merged company into different businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Substantial Investment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Delaware
            and Maryland have 'invested substantially' in AstraZeneca's success and have a right to know what Pfizer's
            intentions are, the governors wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It is also concerning that Pfizer is seeking to
            complete an acquisition involving jobs supporting thousands of families in our states in order to achieve
            tax advantages,' they wrote. 'We while we understand your desire to operate efficiently, relocating your
            corporate and tax residence outside of the United States is not only detrimental to the United States, but
            potentially comes at a direct cost to our states and our constituents.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maryland and
            Delaware have lower unemployment rates than the rest of the nation, and rank in the top third of Bloomberg's
            measure of economic health. In March, when U.S. unemployment was 6.7 percent, the jobless rate was 5.9
            percent in Delaware and 5.6 percent in Maryland, according to the U.S. Labor Department. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            governors, who didn't discuss the letter or operations with officials at AstraZeneca, asked Pfizer to
            respond promptly to their request. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Markell said he received a polite phone call from a
            senior leader at Pfizer, who said the company would keep the governor informed of the company's progress
            with the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Keeping us informed is very different from the kind of jobs they
            have committed to in the U.K.,' Markell said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(An earlier version of this story
            corrected the spelling of AstraZeneca.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Pfizer Raising AstraZeneca Bid Means More Job Cuts Needed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A potential raised bid for AstraZeneca
            Plc (AZN) means that Pfizer Inc. (PFE) would have to generate more than $2
            billion in annual savings from the deal, and that job cuts are
            more likely to happen outside the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, the U.K.'s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
            Pfizer's offer last week of more than $106 billion, about 50
            pounds a share, some 32 percent of which is in cash. At that
            price, Pfizer would have to save at least $2 billion for the bid
            to add to earnings in 2014 and 2015, according to an analysis by
            Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That amount would rise to at least $3 billion if the New
            York-based company raised its bid to 55 pounds a share, and
            Pfizer may need to increase the cash portion to 40 percent,
            Bloomberg Industries analyst Sam Fazeli said. If Pfizer sticks
            to the current cash offer, the savings may have to exceed $3.5
            billion, 'approaching a prohibitive level' in terms of U.K.
            job reductions, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Any cost savings are likely to come partly from RD in
            Sweden and the U.S., as well as the global commercial
            infrastructure,' Fazeli wrote. Pfizer's pledge to Prime
            Minister David Cameron suggests AstraZeneca's 2,000 U.K.
            research and development jobs should be 'safe from cuts if a
            deal goes ahead.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. drugmaker told Cameron last week that it
            would keep at least 20 percent of the combined company's
            research and development workforce in the U.K. for at least five
            years and retain 'substantial' manufacturing facilities at
            AstraZeneca's site south of Manchester. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Swedish Workers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's global RD workforce totals about 10,880 and
            AstraZeneca's about 9,000, according to estimates by Bloomberg
            Industries. With fewer than 20 percent of those jobs in the
            U.K., job cuts may occur outside Britain, said Asthika Goonewardene, a London-based analyst at Bloomberg
            Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca employs about 5,900 people in Sweden, home of
            predecessor company Astra AB. Sweden, unlike the U.K., hasn't
            received any promises on jobs from Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer may be more likely to cut its own RD operations
            than eliminate jobs in the U.K. because of tax benefits, said
            Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. Keeping
            research operations in Britain enables Pfizer to say that
            products were invented in the U.K., and use the country's lower
            tax rate, Wenner said. Pfizer's tax rate is 27.4 percent, while
            AstraZeneca's is 21.3 percent, according to Fazeli. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lower Taxes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They want to lower the tax rate for the overall group by
            implementing transfer pricing, which you can only get when you
            have sufficient RD in the lower tax regime,' Wenner said. 'It
            would make more sense to save 15 to 20 percent of Pfizer RD. It
            would make sense from a both a political point of view and a tax
            point of view.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manufacturing jobs in Britain could also be preserved in
            this way, Wenner said. The most probable positions to be
            eliminated would be in sales and administration, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Typically, a merger results in cost reductions equivalent
            to about 10 percent of the target's global sales, Wenner said.
            In this case, Pfizer may cut $3.3 billion in costs, which
            include a 10 percent decrease in cost of goods sold, 20 percent
            of sales and administrative costs and 20 percent of research and
            development costs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Fights Backlash From U.K, U.S. on AstraZeneca Bid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s record of job cuts after acquisitions is now drawing heat from both sides of
            the Atlantic. U.S. and state politicians have joined their U.K. counterparts in questioning the economic
            impact of the drugmaker's push to buy AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senators Carl Levin
            and Ron Wyden are proposing legislation that would make it harder for U.S. companies to shift their legal
            addresses overseas to avoid U.S. taxes, a move Pfizer has proposed as part of the transaction. Maryland
            Governor Martin O'Malley and Delaware Governor Jack Markell said yesterday they were concerned the deal will
            lead to job losses in their states in a letter to Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            U.S. backlash follows Read's commitment to U.K. officials that Pfizer would keep at least 20 percent of the
            combined company's research-and-development workers and substantial manufacturing plants in the U.K. for at
            least five years. The governors wrote that they want assurances as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Despite our
            requests, we have received no corresponding assurances about retaining jobs and research and development in

            and Illinois, after closing on previous corporate transactions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pain Therapeutics, Durect Fall as Pfizer Evaluates Pill</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics Inc. (PTIE) plunged as
            much as 50 percent in its biggest drop ever after Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
            said it was reassessing their partnership on the experimental
            painkiller Remoxy. A third partner, Durect Corp. (DRRX), also fell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics tumbled 48 percent to $2.78 at 10:11 a.m.
            New York time, after earlier touching $2.67 in its steepest
            intraday fall since the shares were first sold in July 2000.
            Durect declined 42 percent to 93 cents. The companies said in
            regulatory filings today that New York-based Pfizer, the world's
            biggest drugmaker, was evaluating its plans for Remoxy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The medicine is an extended-release oxycodone capsule
            formulated to limit abuse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
            postponed approval in June 2011, after a delay in 2008 when the
            regulators asked for more laboratory data. In a letter disclosed
            by Austin, Texas-based Pain Therapeutics, Pfizer said it doesn't
            anticipate submitting a response to the FDA before mid-2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the years of delay, additional cost incurred to
            bring the program to this point and development work left in the
            program, there will be much to consider,' Pfizer said in the
            letter dated May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, 'there is a regulatory pathway forward' for
            Remoxy, Pfizer said, citing the FDA's comments after a March 28
            hearing. Pfizer's Remoxy team will recommend to management that
            it endorse the program, Alan Litwack, Pfizer's vice president
            for global commercial development, said in the letter. There
            isn't 'an exact time frame' on when a decision will be made. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Additional Studies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer will be 'reaching out to you shortly' for 'a
            confidential discussion relating to contractual terms' between
            the two companies, Litwack wrote to Pain Therapeutics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer believes additional clinical studies will be needed
            to win approval, Durect said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matthew Hogan, chief financial officer for Cupertino,
            California-based Durect, and Pain Therapeutics CFO Peter Roddy
            didn't immediately return messages seeking comment left before
            regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares rose less than 1 percent to $28.77. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
            seeking to acquire AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), advanced its U.K. charm
            offensive with a series of videos extolling the scientific
            benefits, while downplaying the potential tax advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It really meets the scientific needs,' Chief Executive
            Officer Ian Read said today in a video and statement on Pfizer's
            website. 'It meets needs of efficiency, it meets needs of
            strengthening our balance sheet and strengthening our fiscal
            position.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca rejected the bid of about $106 billion from
            Pfizer earlier this month. Buying the company would give Pfizer
            a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs.
            Read and Pascal Soriot, CEO of London-based AstraZeneca, will
            testify to U.K. lawmakers next week amid political tension over
            public-interest issues related to the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said on BBC
            Radio 4 today that the government wants to clarify what a deal
            would mean for British scientific research and jobs. Lawmakers
            are prepared to negotiate hard as they engage both companies, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shareholders will 'get an immediate benefit
            from the cash that we would pay them,' Pfizer's Read said. 'It
            allows them to participate in a very strong combined company
            with great cash flows and a great portfolio, and it allows a
            very efficient allocation of capital.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Improving the efficiency of the organization' and the
            ability to 'liberate the balance sheet and tax of the combined
            companies' are the key reasons for the takeover, Read said.
            'We liked where their science is being done, which is in the
            U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read may soon also face government inquiries in the U.S.
            Pfizer has said it plans to keep the company's operating
            headquarters in the U.S., even as its legal address shifts to
            the U.K. for the lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There was no immediate reply to two telephone messages and
            an e-mail sent to AstraZeneca's London offices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer CEO Faces U.K. Panel as Resistance to Bid Hardens</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
            Ian Read faces heightened public scrutiny of his bid for
            AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) this week when he'll be questioned by lawmakers
            on his commitment to the U.K. in hearings broadcast live. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
            to testify on the U.S. company's offer of about $106 billion for
            London-based AstraZeneca, the biggest takeover bid in U.K.
            history. He and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot are scheduled to
            appear before the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee
            tomorrow and the Science and Technology Committee on May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hearings in London provide a first opportunity for
            lawmakers to question the pharmaceutical executives amid growing
            public and political concern that a takeover would mean job
            losses and cuts to research. As executives from Rupert Murdoch
            to Robert Diamond have learned, lawmakers acting in the name of
            British taxpayers can force company changes to assuage public
            concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The entire political class and media will be spending a
            couple of hours listening to Pfizer's business and intellectual
            case' for the takeover, said Richard Berry, managing director
            of Democratic Audit, a charity that has studied the work of
            parliamentary committees. 'Sessions where people get a grilling
            get a lot of attention and I'm sure the media will highlight the
            most aggressive part.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Video Appearances &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read may have pre-empted some of the questions he is likely
            to face with videos posted on Pfizer's website over the weekend
            in which he outlined the case for the bid, stressing his
            company's commitment to research and explaining its decision to
            shutter a plant in Sandwich, England, in 2011. Pfizer's
            commitment to the new AstraZeneca headquarters being built in
            Cambridge, eastern England, fits the company's record of
            bringing together scientists at its research hub in the U.S.,
            Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the U.K. I see great similarities with Cambridge,
            Massachusetts, where you have this hub of innovation, this hub
            of young scientists,' he said. 'The strategy to build a center
            in Cambridge in fact is in line with our strategy as we've shown
            by what we've done in Massachusetts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Read first approached ministers after announcing the
            bid, Conservatives including Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed it as a vote of confidence
            in the U.K. Since
            then, ministers have grown more cautious, demanding assurances
            about jobs and research spending. According to one person
            familiar with the company's plans, Pfizer won't proceed with the
            bid if the U.K. government is hostile. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Bitter Experience' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bitter experience in other contexts has taught us about
            the importance of really pinning these commitments down and not
            just allowing them to rest as aspirations but to make sure they
            are exacting, binding commitments,' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said in an interview with Sky News
            broadcast yesterday.
            'There are various ways that they could be made more solid and
            that's exactly the kind of thing we're discussing with Pfizer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The most hostile questioning may come from members of the
            opposition Labour Party, whose leader Ed Miliband has accused
            Prime Minister David Cameron of being a cheerleader for the
            takeover. Conservatives will also want to be seen to be asking
            tough questions to demonstrate they are pursuing due diligence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Frankly, we have not seen any guarantees from Pfizer that
            they have an investment plan that is equal to what AstraZeneca
            are putting into the science base over the next 10 years,'
            William Bain, a Labour lawmaker on the Business Committee, said
            in an interview. 'Pfizer does have a record of launching
            takeovers for other pharmaceutical companies and then seeing a
            reduction in investment in research and development.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Executive Roll-call &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow's session will begin at 9:30 a.m. in London with
            evidence from union officials. At 10 a.m., Read will be joined
            by Frank D'Amelio, the company's chief financial officer, and
            Jonathan Emms, its U.K. managing director. Their testimony is
            scheduled to end at 11:15 a.m., when Soriot, flanked by Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's executive vice
            president, and Ian Brimicombe, vice president in charge of corporate finance, will
            make the case against the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The main issue is to understand what Pfizer's commitments
            to the U.K. are and how binding they are,' Julian Huppert, a
            lawmaker who represents Cambridge, said in an interview. 'The
            deal is driven by their desire to avoid paying tax in the U.S.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The British government's 'patent box' allows companies to
            pay reduced tax on products spun out of research done in the
            U.K. For Huppert, it makes Pfizer's attachment to Britain shaky. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer is also facing political pressure in the U.S., where
            the New York-based company has said it plans to keep its
            operating headquarters even as it moves its legal address to the
            U.K. for a lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the videos at the weekend, Read sought to shift the
            emphasis away from tax and onto the business case for the
            takeover, which AstraZeneca's board has rejected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We liked where their science is being done, which is in
            the U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio,'
            he said. The approach was, he said, 'a win-win for society, a
            win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;British parliamentary committees, originally introduced to
            scrutinize the work of government, have become increasingly
            willing to intervene in matters of more general interest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012, the Treasury Committee summoned Diamond, then CEO
            of Barclays Plc, to explain the Libor-rigging scandal. He
            resigned before he got there, despite investor support, after
            politicians on all sides made him a target. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Foam Pie &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., made it through three
            hours of testimony to parliament's culture committee on the
            phone-hacking scandal in 2011. He emerged unscathed barring a
            foam-pie assault by a member of the public after telling members
            that his appearance was 'the most humble day of my life.' His
            son James wasn't so lucky, with his account of events disputed
            by two former executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first sign of whether the U.K. government's view on
            Pfizer and AstraZeneca has shifted as a result of the testimony
            will come at 1 p.m. tomorrow, when Business Secretary Vince Cable responds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cable has been examining how Pfizer's proposed takeover
            could be blocked on public-interest grounds, including the
            possibility of referring the case to the European Commission or
            proposing a change to the Enterprise Act that would widen the
            public-interest test for takeovers, a person familiar with
            discussions in government said on May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I will do whatever is right for Britain, I will always
            stand up for British jobs, British interests, British science,
            British RD,' Cameron said when asked on BBC TV yesterday about
            toughening up the law on takeovers. 'But when we think of that,
            it is important to make the point that Britain benefits
            massively by being an economy that's open to overseas
            investment.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Pursues More Guarantees From Pfizer Over AstraZeneca</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. signaled it wants more
            guarantees from Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker seeking to
            acquire AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), and held open the possibility of
            blocking the deal using a 'public interest' defense. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated today that he wants
            'more' from the company, while his deputy Nick Clegg said he
            wants 'exacting, binding commitments' rather than
            'aspirations.' Their comments came after Pfizer yesterday
            issued a series of videos extolling the scientific benefits of a
            deal, while downplaying the potential tax advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I will always stand up for British jobs, British
            interests, British science, British RD,' Cameron said in an
            interview with the BBC's 'Andrew Marr' program. Business
            secretary Vince Cable 'is looking at this issue of public
            interest defense and he will report back to parliament on
            that,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca rejected a bid of about $106 billion from
            Pfizer earlier this month. Buying the company would give Pfizer
            a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs.
            Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read and Pascal Soriot, CEO
            of London-based AstraZeneca, will testify to U.K. lawmakers this
            week amid political tension over public-interest issues related
            to the takeover. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Sells $4.5 Billion of Bonds to Repay Obligations</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
            seeking to acquire AstraZeneca (AZN) Plc, sold $4.5 billion of bonds
            to repay securities that mature within a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offering, which was increased from $4.25 billion,
            included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that
            yielded 48 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds of the issue will be used to repay 900 million
            euros ($1.2 billion) of 4.75 percent notes due in December, and
            a portion of the company's $3 billion of 5.35 percent notes due
            March 2015, according to a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bond sale comes as the biggest U.S. drugmaker is
            offering about $106 billion for London-based AstraZeneca. Along
            with the lower tax rate linked to AstraZeneca's U.K. base, Chief
            Executive Officer Ian Read has said the acquisition would give
            New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of experimental
            cancer drugs that use the body's own immune system to attack the
            disease. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
            to testify on the U.S. company's offer for AstraZeneca, amid
            growing public and political concern that a takeover would mean
            job losses and cuts to research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In one potential scenario, a successful acquisition would
            entail borrowing 'more than $30 billion,' Carol Levenson, a
            New York-based analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, wrote in a report
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer also sold $1 billion of 1.1 percent, three-year
            notes at 25 basis points more than benchmarks, $1 billion of 3.4
            percent, 10-year bonds at a relative yield of 80 basis points,
            and $500 million of 4.4 percent, 30-year debentures with a 95
            basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. The company also issued
            $500 million of three-year, floating-rate securities at 15 basis
            points more than the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's $1 billion of 3 percent notes due 2023 fell
            0.4 cent to 97.7 cents on the dollar for a yield of 3.3 percent
            on May 9, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
            the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Presses Case for AstraZeneca Deal Ahead of U.K. Hearing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) pressed its case for
            buying AstraZeneca hours before the chief executives of both
            companies are scheduled to appear before U.K. lawmakers to
            discuss Pfizer's pursuit of the country's second-biggest
            drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a presentation to AstraZeneca shareholders published
            today, Pfizer repeated its rationale for the deal, saying a deal
            would create an industry leader with scale and operational
            efficiency as well as a broader portfolio of experimental
            medicines. AstraZeneca faces challenges as a standalone company,
            including the declining revenue from products losing patent
            protection, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer proposed by Pfizer on May 2, which AstraZeneca
            rejected as undervaluing the company, was based solely on public
            information, Pfizer said today in a statement. Talks between the
            companies would enable AstraZeneca's management to provide
            Pfizer with a better understanding of the company, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Constructive engagement may lead to a transaction that
            AstraZeneca can recommend,' Pfizer said. 'Pfizer will continue
            to be disciplined on price.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Avoids Job-Cut Specifics in AstraZeneca Testimony</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer Ian Read refused to be pinned down on his commitment to
            preserve jobs in the U.K. as skeptical lawmakers grilled him about the company's unsolicited offer for
            AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot followed Read, telling the
            Business, Innovation and Skills Committee he couldn't rule out accepting an offer from Pfizer. The U.S.
            company plans to sweeten the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9 billion) bid for a second time, people with
            knowledge of the matter said. Pfizer may wait until after the hearings to offer more, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read faced members of Parliament who are concerned Pfizer will cut jobs and close facilities, which
            has been its pattern in previous takeovers. Pfizer reiterated its pledge to keep 20 percent of its global
            research and development workforce in the U.K. and maintain AstraZeneca's factory in Macclesfield. The
            company would reduce employment after the acquisition, Read said, though when questioned he wouldn't say if
            that means Pfizer could cut science jobs in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The commitment of 20 percent of a
            global company's RD is an unprecedented commitment,' said Read. 'It's a substantial commitment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. politicians, led by Prime Minister David Cameron, have said they want New York-based Pfizer to
            do more to ensure it will protect British jobs and science. Business Secretary Vince Cable told the
            committee the government is considering legislation that would allow it to intervene in the transaction.

        <headline>Pfizer CEO's Parliament Grilling Goes From Rough to Rude</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read faced increasingly hostile questioning from U.K.
            lawmakers today over his takeover bid for AstraZeneca Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a standing-room-only
            hearing, Read's job was to convince Parliament's skeptical Business, Innovation Skills Committee that he
            plans to keep science jobs in Britain if the deal goes ahead. He was preceded by union representatives who
            said their legal advice was there was no way Pfizer could be held to any of its promises. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm
            here to make those commitments, I intend to honor those commitments,' Read told an opposition Labour Party
            lawmaker who'd asked how he could be trusted. He went on to confirm he plans job cuts. 'That's part of being
            efficient.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response, committee members from both the governing Conservative Party
            and Labour interrupted him, accused him of being coached in advance of the hearing and told him he was
            holding back information. They asked for solid numbers on jobs, and Read told them he couldn't give them.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans to sweeten the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9 billion) bid for AstraZeneca for
            a second time, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he
            wants it to do more to protect British jobs and science. Business Secretary Vince Cable is investigating
            whether the government can legally block the bid. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Says Too Soon to Talk About U.S. AstraZeneca Jobs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
            Ian Read told the governors of Maryland and Delaware it's too
            soon to determine what effect the company's bid for AstraZeneca
            Plc (AZN) will have on jobs and manufacturing in their states. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca, the U.K.'s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
            an offer of about $106 billion from Pfizer earlier this month,
            saying the New York-based pharmaceutical company wasn't offering
            enough. Pfizer is planning to increase its bid, said people with
            knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
            the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the biggest U.S.-based drugmaker, said it would
            shift its legal address to the U.K. to reap tax benefits if the
            deal goes through. Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and
            Delaware Governor Jack Markell wrote Read last week asking what
            assurances he could give them for the 5,700 AstraZeneca workers
            in their states. Pfizer already has pledged to keep at least
            one-fifth of the companies' research units and a substantial
            manufacturing presence in the U.K. for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because we are in the very early stages of our proposal
            and are not in direct discussions, it is premature to speculate
            on any specific impact this would have on jobs and facilities in
            any given state,' Read said in letters dated yesterday to the
            two Democratic governors. 'I can tell you that Pfizer will
            continue to perform operational, research and manufacturing
            activity and will continue to have a significant number of
            employees in the U.S.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Maryland's U.S. congressional delegation sent its own
            letter to Read yesterday expressing concern that there may be
            job losses among AstraZeneca's 3,000-plus employees in the
            state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Similar Assurances' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As you evaluate your next steps, we ask you to extend
            similar assurances to those you gave in the U.K. to the research
            and development workforce in Maryland,' wrote U.S. Senators
            Barbara Mikulski and Benjamin Cardin and Representatives C.A. 'Dutch' Ruppersberger, Chris Van Hollen, John
            Sarbanes and John Delaney. 'AstraZeneca and its MedImmune subsidiary have strong
            presences in the state, and their workforces are highly skilled
            and extremely effective.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer hasn't had access to any proprietary information
            from London-based AstraZeneca and the company still needs to
            collect additional details on its business and prospects, Read
            wrote to the two governors. He said Ken Cole, Pfizer's senior
            vice president of government relations, would schedule a meeting
            to give them an update on the status of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markell said last week that updates on the status of the
            discussions wouldn't be enough to assuage his concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Keeping us informed is very different from the kind of
            jobs they have committed to in the U.K.,' Markell said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer CEO Read Says AstraZeneca Bid Won't Harm Patients</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
            Ian Read fought back against accusations that his bid for
            AstraZeneca Plc would harm patients and damage science in the
            U.K. as he faced Parliament for a second day. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca has resisted the 60.4-billion-pound ($101.9
            billion) offer, and said yesterday that the disruption of a
            buyout could jeopardize its pipeline of experimental drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's no truth that products of a critical nature would
            be delayed getting to patients,' Read told the Science and
            Technology Committee. 'If anything, we would accelerate those
            products.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's proposed takeover is facing skepticism from U.K.
            lawmakers concerned by possible job cuts and the company's
            unwillingness to commit to preserving AstraZeneca's workforce.
            Pfizer said it would maintain 20 percent of its global research
            and development employees in the U.K. for five years, without
            specifying the number of jobs. Read said the merger would result
            in job cuts and a reduction in total RD spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I suspect the combined research budget will go down,'
            Read said. 'I suspect there will be less scientists than the
            natural arithmetic combination of the two.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The combined company would be more efficient and more
            productive, and reflects the changing shape of the industry as
            governments pressure drug companies to reduce costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AstraZeneca Cancer Drug Coveted by Pfizer Works in Trial</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) said an experimental
            cancer drug shrank tumors in half of patients in an early-stage
            study, a result that may help its case that Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s
            takeover bid substantially undervalues the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drug, called AZD9291, is designed to help patients with
            a gene mutation found in 15 percent of Caucasian patients with
            non-small cell lung cancer, and 40 percent of Asians. If
            approved, it could generate more than $2.2 billion by 2025, said
            Seamus Fernandez, a Leerink Partners analyst in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The findings were released in connection with the American
            Society of Clinical Oncology meeting that will start May 30 in
            Chicago. AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said
            data from the meeting, combined with other pipeline findings
            coming later this year, should convince investors that Pfizer's
            bid of about 48 pounds ($81) a share sells the company short. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'ASCO is important but it's one step,' Soriot said in a
            telephone interview yesterday. 'We hope as we progress this
            year, investors will become more convinced there is more value
            in this company than what is offered to us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Data from a trial on a separate AstraZeneca lung cancer
            medicine, called MEDI4736, will also be presented at the
            meeting. That experimental drug is an antibody designed to
            inhibit a protein, called PD-L1, that helps some cancers avoid
            being detected and attacked by the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Read Gets Easier Ride in Second U.K. Parliament Hearing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;After a rough ride in front of the
            U.K. Parliament's Business Committee yesterday, Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
            Chief Executive Officer Ian Read got gentler treatment from its
            science and technology panel today over his plan to take over
            AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There was a smaller audience for the hearing in London,
            with empty seats compared with the standing-room-only session
            the previous day. It was still a larger one than the committee
            chairman, Andrew Miller, was used to. 'A lot of people are
            interested,' he commented, looking around. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Much of the questioning focused on how a merged company
            would look. Read said it would 'enable us to be competitive.'
            Testifying separately later for AstraZeneca, CEO Pascal Soriot
            argued it was 'a little bit more complicated than putting two
            pieces of paper together.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While neither committee has any formal influence over a
            possible takeover, both show how much Pfizer is operating in an
            atmosphere of anxiety about its offer of more than $100 billion,
            which AstraZeneca has rebuffed. With European and local
            elections next week, the bid has been pushed to the center of
            British political debate and dominated Prime Minister David Cameron's questions session in the House of
            Commons today for
            the second week running. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There was little fresh argument today from either side.
            Read said there was 'no truth' in yesterday's suggestion from
            AstraZeneca that a merger would delay the development of life-saving drugs. Such work would be
            'ring-fenced,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Lose Momentum' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soriot replied that mergers cause anxiety, with scientists
            'not sure if their job will exist tomorrow.' In such a
            situation, he said, 'you can quickly lose momentum.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jim Dowd, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party,
            which has opposed the takeover, again raised Pfizer's record in
            Sweden, where it closed a research center after a takeover.
            'Why do people say your word's not to be trusted?' he asked. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People who talk to me don't say my word's not to be
            trusted,' Read replied. 'I'd like people to tell me a
            commitment Pfizer hasn't met.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soriot was questioned by Miller about why a merger would be
            more disruptive than his own plan to move research from
            Manchester, in England's northwest, to Cambridge in the east.
            Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's vice president in charge of
            development and a former Pfizer executive, said the two
            companies had entirely different research structures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soriot declined to say whether the government should
            intervene to block the takeover. 'I'm a biologist, I just try
            to do my job,' he said. 'I'm not a policy maker.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last to appear before the panel was Science Minister David Willetts, who insisted he was optimistic
            about the future,
            whatever the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sandwich Success &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asked about Pfizer's 2011 decision to close its Sandwich
            plant in southeast England, he said it had worked out well
            thanks to government intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There was a nightmare scenario where that would end up as
            an empty building, with a padlock swinging in the wind,' he
            said. 'We've ended up instead with a discovery park with 40
            tenants.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Willetts argued that while the government was 'pressing
            very hard' for Pfizer commitments, there was no need for
            'national pessimism' because Britain was known as a great
            place for science. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You'd be idiotic if you weren't doing research and
            development in the U.K. -- it's a great place,' Willetts told
            the committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're all proud,' Tory lawmaker Sarah Newton replied. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Takeover Is 'Not Inevitable,' AstraZeneca CEO Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) Chief Executive
            Officer Pascal Soriot said a sale of the U.K. drugmaker is 'not
            inevitable,' increasing pressure on Pfizer Inc. to raise its
            60.4 billion-pound ($101 billion) offer to kick-start talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The price is really far from what we think the value of
            the company is,' Soriot said today in a telephone interview.
            Because Pfizer is offering stock as part of the deal,
            AstraZeneca would also need assurances about the future of the
            new company before agreeing to negotiate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soriot's comments may increase speculation that New York-based Pfizer will take its offer directly
            to AstraZeneca
            shareholders. The proposed takeover is facing skepticism from
            U.K. lawmakers concerned about possible job cuts and Pfizer (PFE)'s
            unwillingness to commit to preserving the workforce of the
            country's second-biggest drugmaker. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said it
            was difficult to make more specific guarantees because
            AstraZeneca hasn't engaged in talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Read and Soriot both appeared before parliamentary
            committees yesterday and today to answer questions about
            consequences of the acquisition. With their testimony behind
            them, the focus is shifting to Pfizer's next move. Pfizer plans
            to raise its offer, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A takeover could distract London-based AstraZeneca from
            advancing its pipeline of experimental drugs, and even more so
            were Pfizer to make a hostile bid, Soriot said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Drug Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The risks are exacerbated in a hostile situation,' he
            said in the interview. 'Any merger of this magnitude is
            disruptive and that's why we would want to discuss strategy, the
            operating model and how we would go about merging these
            companies, if we ever get to this.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer would try to protect AstraZeneca's most valuable
            products in a takeover and wouldn't jeopardize the pipeline,
            Read said to the Science and Technology committee today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's no truth that products of a critical nature would
            be delayed getting to patients,' Read said. 'If anything, we
            would accelerate those products.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer urged AstraZeneca to engage in talks so that the two
            companies could reach an agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer contacted AstraZeneca last year to discuss a
            purchase, and Chairman Leif Johansson and Soriot flew to New
            York to meet with Pfizer, which made the initial bid of about
            46.61 pounds a share, Soriot said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lower Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The subsequent cash-and-stock offer initially valued the
            company at about 50 pounds a share and now has a value of 47.83
            pounds a share. AstraZeneca rose 0.3 percent to 46.54 pounds at
            the close of trading in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The offer today is 48 pounds,' Soriot said. 'The offer
            is hardly different from the January price, but in the meantime,
            our pipeline has progressed quite a lot. I don't see why we
            would accept today what we didn't think was the right price in
            January.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;None of AstraZeneca's shareholders have pressed him to
            accept the current offer, said Soriot, who is on the company's
            board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Of course, shareholders will tell us, but they don't even
            need to tell us, that if the appropriate offer was made, we
            should consider the offer,' he said. 'But we know this and we
            certainly agree.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Lawmaker Refuses to Apologize After Pfizer Rape Comparison</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A lawmaker from Ed Miliband's U.K.
            opposition Labour Party refused calls to apologize for comparing
            the proposed Pfizer Inc. (PFE) takeover of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) to rape by
            the U.S. company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Austin Mitchell said in a posting on Twitter that Prime
            Minister David Cameron 'dare not stop Pfizer because he dare
            not offend the U.S. in any way. Roll up rapists.' His comments
            followed heated exchanges in the House of Commons between
            Cameron and Miliband over the deal today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Called on to apologize by lawmakers from Cameron's
            Conservative Party and other Twitter users, Mitchell refused.
            'Naughty me,' he later tweeted. 'Substute rapaciousness
            before any more Physer defenders weigh in.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mitchell was later invited on to LBC radio and asked to
            apologize for the remarks. 'I am not going to say sorry, that
            would be silly, I am not sorry,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot of Tories have talked about the rape of the
            countryside by HS2,' he said, referring to the planned north-south high speed rail link. 'I think it's a
            word that's used in
            other contexts too. I think this row is frankly entirely
            artificial. I think the storm is really a very defensive one by
            people who don't like the takeover but don't think they can stop
            it and therefore they'd rather turn the heat on something
            else.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The prime minister thinks that analogy is quite wrong,'
            Cameron's spokesman Jean-Christophe Gray told reporters in
            London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Labour's treasury spokesman Ed Balls said in a later
            interview with LBC that Mitchell should apologize. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Government Urged to Hold Pfizer to Account Over AstraZeneca</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmakers who questioned Pfizer
            Inc. executives yesterday have written to the government urging
            it to hold the company to account for promises over the future
            of AstraZeneca Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parliament's Science and Technology Committee said its
            members want Pfizer to 'voluntarily strengthen and lengthen'
            its promises to keep jobs and research and development in
            Britain if the $101 billion proposed takeover goes ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Science is a long-term enterprise and it requires a
            genuinely long-term commitment,' committee chairman, Andrew
            Miller, said in a May 14 letter to Science Minister David Willetts made public today. 'We are not yet
            convinced that
            this is what Pfizer is offering. The government must be willing
            -- and, crucially, able -- to hold Pfizer to account if
            necessary.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The panel questioned Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot
            along with other
            executives and Willets. They focused on Pfizer's pledges on RD
            and jobs in Britain and the implications for the two companies'
            drug pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five-year limit on Pfizer's commitments is not long
            enough as the pharmaceutical industry 'measures progress by
            decades rather than years,' Miller said in the letter. He said
            the committee wanted more detail on the promises as there could
            still be cuts in research by a combined company in which
            AstraZeneca would be the junior partner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Any threat to AstraZeneca's research capacity must, to an
            extent, be considered a threat to U.K. science,' he said.
            'Further, longer-term guarantees need to be obtained before we
            can be confident of Pfizer's commitment to the U.K.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The letter also questioned the wisdom of creating such a
            large company when the trend in pharmaceuticals is for
            'smaller, more agile operations.' The merger of the two
            companies would also cause disruption and uncertainty in both
            companies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Leads $41 Billion of Bond Sales as Yields Decline</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of corporate bonds in the U.S.
            are capping the busiest week this month as companies seized on
            borrowing costs that dropped to the lowest in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the biggest U.S. drugmaker, issued $4.5
            billion and Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen AG raised $3.5
            billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings of
            about $41 billion were the most since $47.3 billion in the five
            days ended April 25 and compare with a weekly average of $29.1
            billion over the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance rose as yields decreased amid signs U.S. economic
            growth is faltering. Industrial production unexpectedly declined
            in April and consumer confidence fell in May from a nine-month
            high. David Tepper, founder of $20 billion hedge-fund firm
            Appaloosa Management LP, said he's nervous about markets as the
            economy isn't growing fast enough. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The rates environment has changed a bit from where it was
            a couple weeks ago, and that has provided a lot of companies the
            opportunity to come to market,' Jody Lurie, a corporate credit
            analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, said in
            a telephone interview. 'It has let them access the debt market
            more attractively.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
            rather than government debentures widened by 1 basis point this
            week to 170 basis points yesterday, up from an almost seven-year
            low of 167 basis points on April 22, according to the Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate High Yield Index. Yields
            fell to 3.62 percent, the least since May 2013 and down from 3.7
            percent on May 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pfizer, Volkswagen &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's sale included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that yielded 48 basis points
            more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds from the
            deal, its first since last May, will be used by the New York-based company to repay debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, issued debt in five
            parts including $1.45 billion of 1.25 percent, three-year notes
            with a relative yield of 47 basis points, Bloomberg data show.
            The sale was its biggest dollar-denominated offering ever, the
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to $32.2 billion
            from $21.7 billion last week and compared with a weekly average
            of $22.2 billion over the past 12 months, Bloomberg data show.
            Offerings of speculative-grade bonds fell to $9 billion, from
            $10.9 billion last week and compared with a weekly average of
            $6.8 billion over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody's
            Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard Poor's. A
            basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AstraZeneca Chairman 'Surprised' Pfizer Took Offer Public</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) Chairman Leif Johansson got off the phone last night thinking Pfizer Inc.
            (PFE)'s offer of 53.50 pounds a share for the second-largest U.K. drugmaker was its best and final offer.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Johansson was 'surprised' to see Pfizer raise its bid to 55 pounds in a press
            release. The new offer of 69.4 billion pounds ($117 billion) may be a maneuver around AstraZeneca's
            management, pitched publicly to pressure the company to enter formal negotiations. AstraZeneca rejected it
            today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Johansson wouldn't say the surprise proposal was hostile, he said today in
            a telephone interview, 'I certainly will not call it super-friendly.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:
            AstraZeneca Rejects Pfizer's $117 Billion Offer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's offer late yesterday, which the
            company said was final, is the latest salvo in a battle of wills between the companies. Pfizer has offered
            more cash and stock, although London-based AstraZeneca said it won't talk until its concerns about
            regulatory risk and the future of the combined company are addressed. New York-based Pfizer would also need
            to increase its offer to at least 58.85 pounds before the board could recommend a deal to shareholders,
            Johansson said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'What the board would need to do is look at overall value, including the
            transaction risk, the execution risk, and we would try to put together a package, holistic view of what that
            value is,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Labour Party Says AstraZeneca Right to Reject Pfizer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. opposition Labour Party's
            business spokesman, Chuka Umunna, took sides in the battle for
            AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), saying the company's board was right to reject
            Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s increased takeover offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a sign of how a possible future Labour government led by
            Ed Miliband would be more willing to intervene in takeovers,
            Umunna characterized Pfizer as principally interested in
            'financial engineering' and cutting its tax bill, and said
            this was a reason to block a takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca shares plunged the most in more than 16 years
            today after the company dismissed as too low a 69.4 billion-pound ($117 billion) offer that New York-based
            Pfizer said was
            final. A deal would create the world's biggest drugmaker. The
            offer failed to account for the value of the U.K. company's
            pipeline of experimental medicines and presents risks for
            shareholders, AstraZeneca said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is welcome the AstraZeneca board has remained resolute
            and sought to act in the best long-term interests of the company
            and its vital work in developing new life-saving drugs,' Umunna
            said in an e-mailed statement. 'Pfizer has said today that it
            will not seek to launch a hostile bid and must not renege on
            this promise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until May 16, Labour restricted itself to calling for an
            examination of whether a takeover would be in the public
            interest. Then, in an interview with Bloomberg Television,
            Umunna said that if he became business secretary after the May
            2015 election and a deal were still going through, he would look
            for a way to block it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Government Stance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vince Cable, who's business secretary in the current
            coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, said today the
            government is keeping its options open on the Pfizer offer.
            Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a matter for the
            companies to resolve themselves and the government should be
            neutral. The premier said last week he wants 'further
            assurances' from Pfizer that a deal wouldn't hit jobs and
            research in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miliband said in 2011 Labour should distinguish between
            'predator' businesses and 'producers.' Umunna later tried to
            soften this, saying it didn't mean identifying companies as good
            or bad. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sweden Urges Pfizer to Abandon AstraZeneca Takeover Ambition</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sweden's Finance Minister Anders Borg
            is urging Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to give up its efforts to take over
            drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc, arguing the deal would destroy
            research and development jobs in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Borg, who is battling rising unemployment in Sweden ahead
            of September elections, criticized the U.S. firm for adopting
            what he described as an 'aggressive strategy' to buy
            AstraZeneca, which employs 5,900 people in Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would be very wise of Pfizer to consider to withdraw
            from this process,' he said yesterday in an interview in
            Stockholm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Borg last week urged shareholders to reject Pfizer's bid,
            which he characterized as a 'hostile process' in part aimed at
            cutting Pfizer's tax burden. AstraZeneca, formed in a 1999
            merger between Astra AB and Zeneca Plc, yesterday rejected a
            sweetened $117 billion offer from Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The takeover bid is likely to fail because British law
            prohibits the U.S. firm from improving its offer after declaring
            it final, according to people familiar with the transaction.
            Pfizer is expected to announce that it will not make a formal
            bid by May 26, which is the deadline for the U.S. firm to make
            an official offer, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Very Aggressive' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very aggressive and raw strategy that Pfizer has
            and I think that undermines Pfizer's credibility in the long-term,' Borg said. 'It may create risks for
            them. We're very
            worried about what this will mean to research and development in
            Europe, in the U.K. and Sweden.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Miss on AstraZeneca May Put Breakup Back in Play</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;With prospects for an AstraZeneca Plc deal falling apart, Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
            Ian Read is facing a new question from investors: What now? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There aren't other ripe
            targets offering the triple benefits of a lower tax rate in the U.K., cost savings and new cancer drugs,
            analysts say. Without AstraZeneca's promise of new growth, Read, 60, will likely return to an earlier plan
            to further break up what was once the world's biggest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read has split Pfizer
            into at least two units internally, with the idea they may one day be spun off on their own, potentially
            giving investors a choice between one business stocked with brand-name drugs and a second with older
            products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;While Read may have failed with AstraZeneca, he's gained a reputation for doing what's needed to
            please investors. Pfizer's shares have gained 75 percent since he took over as CEO in December 2010. 'He'll
            do anything to get the stock price up,' said Jeff Jonas, an investor with Gabelli Co. in Rye, New York. 'As
            long as he continues to have that view, he'll be fine.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca yesterday rejected
            New York-based Pfizer's third takeover offer, for 69.4 billion pounds ($117 billion). At the same time,
            London-based AstraZeneca's chairman, Leif Johansson, said the deal -- the largest ever in the industry --
            was probably dead under U.K. takeover rules. &lt;/p&gt;

            leaving Madison, New Jersey-based Zoetis fully independent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The exchange would end the latest stage of Pfizer Chief
            Executive Officer Ian Read's plans to slim down the company and
            concentrate on producing new drugs. Pfizer agreed in April 2012
            to sell its baby food unit to Nestle SA (NESN), the world's biggest
            food maker, for $11.9 billion. Zoetis shares have risen 29
            percent since trading started in February after an initial
            public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The proceeds from the IPO plus the Pfizer share reduction
            from this exchange will more than offset the lost income from
            Zoetis,' Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with International
            Strategy Investment Group LLC in New York said in a note to
            clients. The timing was sooner than expected, and a positive for
            Pfizer because it should add to earnings next year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BlackRock Is Said to Encourage Pfizer-AstraZeneca Talks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Plc's (AZN) biggest shareholder
            says the drugmaker and its potential acquirer Pfizer Inc. (PFE) should
            continue to talk, a person with knowledge of the matter said. A
            second investor also pushed for negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), which owns 8 percent of London-based
            AstraZeneca and 6.8 percent of Pfizer, is encouraging
            discussions between the two companies, said the person, who
            asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo Co., which holds 1.3 percent
            of AstraZeneca shares according to filings, said today it is in
            favor of new talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're very disappointed that AstraZeneca management has
            not agreed to terms we think are beneficial to the
            shareholders,' Thomas Hancock, co-head of Grantham, Mayo's
            Global Equity group, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money-management firms have been weighing in since
            AstraZeneca spurned New York-based Pfizer's 69 billion-pound
            ($116 billion) takeover proposal on May 19. The U.S. company has
            until 5 p.m. London time on May 26 to make a firm offer. If it
            doesn't, Pfizer can't come back with another bid for six months,
            except in certain circumstances, according to U.K. takeover
            rules. Pfizer can renew its effort after three months if it's
            invited to do so by AstraZeneca. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer on May 18 declared its sweetened offer, valued at 55
            pounds a share, as final under the current process, so by U.K.
            rules it can't raise the bid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lauren Post, a spokeswoman for BlackRock in New York,
            declined to comment. BlackRock, based in New York, is the
            world's largest money manager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sky News reported BlackRock's view earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dealmakers Ignore Tax Limit Plan Spurred by Pfizer Bid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Democrats in Congress are trying to block companies from cutting their tax bills by moving their
            legal address outside the U.S. through a merger. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies are forging ahead anyway.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're working on a lot of deals that have this element to it,' said Robert Profusek,
            head of the mergers and acquisitions group at Jones Day in New York. 'Nobody's said, 'Stop the music.'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers upset about so-called inversions are pledging that any limits they pass will be
            retroactive, to May 8. They haven't attracted a single Republican supporter. That lack of bipartisanship has
            led companies and their advisers to shrug and keep planning similar transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since
            Jan. 1, 2012, 14 companies have completed or announced such deals. Investors are pressuring other companies
            such as Walgreen Co. to consider the idea at a pace that hasn't slowed since Senators Carl Levin of Michigan
            and Ron Wyden of Oregon called for retroactive tax laws. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How U.S. Companies Buy Tax
            Breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal that piqued congressional interest this month was Pfizer Inc.
            (PFE)'s bid to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), take advantage of the lower U.K. tax rate and leave its top
            executives in New York. AstraZeneca rejected Pfizer's offers, and Pfizer ended its bid yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Ponders Next Move After AstraZeneca Bid Rejection</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest proposed deal in drug
            industry history is dead. Or, dead for now. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the largest U.S. drugmaker, yesterday
            abandoned its effort to buy AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) for 69.4 billion
            pounds ($117 billion), saying the public bid rejected by its
            London-based competitor represented 'full value.' AstraZeneca
            said it welcomed 'the opportunity to continue building on the
            momentum we have already demonstrated.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under U.K. takeover rules, Pfizer had until 5 p.m. London
            time yesterday to make a firm offer. The regulations now require
            a cooling-off period of at least three months before talks can
            restart, giving both drugmakers time to decide what happens
            next. Pfizer hopes AstraZeneca's investors will push the
            company's board to come to the table, while AstraZeneca faces
            pressure to deliver on its promises of a productive roster of
            experimental medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is quite a decent chance actually that there will
            be a deal later this year, most likely I would say after three
            months,' Erik Hultgard, an analyst with Nordea Bank AB in
            Stockholm, said in a telephone interview. 'There was quite a
            small spread between what the board said they could accept and
            what Pfizer actually wanted to pay. There are likely
            shareholders on both sides that want this to happen.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Issues $4 Billion of Debt in First U.S. Sale Since 2009</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) sold $4 billion of bonds
            in its first dollar-denominated offering in more than four
            years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker issued $1 billion of 1.5
            percent, five-year securities to yield 50 basis points more than
            similar-maturity Treasuries and an equal portion of 3 percent,
            10-year debt with a relative yield of 87.5 basis points,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer also sold $750 million of 0.9 percent notes due
            January 2017 paying a spread of 45 and an equal amount of 4.3
            percent, 30-year debt that pays 100, Bloomberg data show. A $500
            million portion of five-year, floating-rate debt yields 30 basis
            points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The issue will be used to repay the company's 1.85 billion
            euros of 3.625 percent bonds due June 3, according to a
            regulatory filing. Proceeds may also be used to repay a portion
            of Pfizer's $750 million of 4.5 percent debentures and $1.75
            billion of 5.5 percent securities, both maturing in February
            2014, the company said in the filing. Other funds may be used
            for investments or to pay down part of its $1.75 billion of
            commercial paper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer last sold dollar-denominated debt in March 2009,
            when the New-York based pharmaceutical manufacturer issued $13.5
            billion of securities in five parts. That offering included
            $3.25 billion of 6.2 percent, 10-year notes that were priced to
            yield 325 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries.
            Those bonds traded at 124.9 cents on the dollar on May 22 to
            yield 1.67 percent, or 78.5 basis points more than benchmarks,
            according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new notes are rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service,
            the credit grader said in a statement today. Citigroup Inc.,
            Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank
            of Scotland Group Plc managed the offering, according to a
            regulatory filing by Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow in
            dollars from each other, was set at 0.273 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Ditching BlackBerry, Citing Its 'Volatile' State</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world's biggest
            drugmaker, will wean off of BlackBerry (BBRY) Ltd.'s phones, citing
            concerns that the mobile technology company might not be around
            in the future or may have service interrupted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer told employees who use BlackBerry devices to instead
            get an Apple Inc. phone or one run on Google Inc.'s Android
            operating system. The drugmaker cited Waterloo, Ontario-based
            BlackBerry's declining market share and noted that the company
            attempted to sell itself. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In response to declining sales, the company is in a
            volatile state,' New York-based Pfizer told employees in a memo
            obtained by Bloomberg News. 'We recommend that BlackBerry
            clients use their BlackBerry devices and plan to migrate to a
            new device at normal contract expiration.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After years of losing customers to Apple's iPhone and
            devices running Android, BlackBerry is struggling to keep
            remaining users from defecting. The new BlackBerry 10 operating
            system, meant to fuel a comeback, drew a tepid response from
            buyers, and the company had to write off almost $1 billion in
            unsold inventory last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer had 92,000 employees as of its last annual filing,
            making it the eighth-biggest employer among U.S. and Western
            European-based health-care companies, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. Contingency plans have been developed in case
            BlackBerry shuts down or is unable to provide services, Pfizer
            said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We never go out in the media and talk about our service
            providers,' said Joan Campion, a Pfizer spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A $4.7 billion takeover bid for BlackBerry was scrapped
            this month, prompting a shakeup at the company. BlackBerry
            installed former Sybase Inc. Chief Executive Officer John Chen
            as the head of the company and raised $1 billion in convertible
            debt to help bolster its disappearing cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a blog post on Nov. 13, Chen tried to reassure customers
            that the company is not going anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We also want our customers to know that BlackBerry has
            significant financial strength for the long-haul,' he said. 'I
            am confident that we will rebuild BlackBerry for the benefit of
            all of our constituencies.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)'s HIV drug
            Tivicay was recommended for approval by the European Union's
            drug regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tivicay won the backing of the Committee for Medicinal
            Products for Human Use in combination with other antiretroviral
            medicines for the treatment of HIV patients over the age of 12,
            the European Medicines Agency said in a statement today. The
            drug was developed by ViiV Healthcare Ltd., Glaxo's venture with
            two other drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The treatment, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
            Administration in August, reduced the HIV virus to undetectable
            levels in more people than Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD)'s Atripla, the
            world's best-selling AIDS drug, in a clinical trial released
            last year. The medicine, also known as dolutegravir, is an
            integrase strand transfer inhibitor that interferes with the
            enzymes necessary for HIV to multiply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck Co. makes the first and only other approved
            integrase strand transfer inhibitor, Isentress, which was
            cleared in 2007 and had sales of $1.5 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ViiV is an independent company that is a venture of Glaxo,
            New York-based Pfizer Inc. and Osaka, Japan-based drugmaker
            Shionogi Co. Glaxo owns 76.5 percent of ViiV while Pfizer has
            a 13.5 percent stake and Shionogi holds 10 percent, according to
            Glaxo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EMA's recommendations are the final stage before the
            European Commission, the EU's executive arm, approves or rejects
            a drug for sale to patients in the 28-nation region. The EC
            usually follows the committee's advice. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Ligand
            Pharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND) won U.S. approval for a drug to treat hot
            flashes and osteoporosis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared the drug, Duavee,
            for moderate-to-severe hot flashes related to menopause in women
            who haven't had a hysterectomy, the agency said today in a
            statement. The medicine, also approved to prevent post-menopausal osteoporosis, will be available in the
            first quarter
            of 2014, Pfizer said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The medicine from Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker,
            will enter a market for hot-flash treatments that includes
            Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co. (4530)'s Brisdelle. Eli Lilly Co. (LLY)'s
            Evista, which generated $1 billion in sales last year, was
            approved in 1997 for prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis.
            Duavee is the first FDA approved medicine that combines estrogen
            with a compound that selects certain tissues to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duavee contains the ingredient bazedoxifene that can act
            like estrogen on bone to protect density combined with a mixture
            of estrogens. Pfizer, based in New York, sells Premarin, which
            generated $1 billion in sales last year and is derived from the
            urine of pregnant horses. Premarin has six uses, including the
            two Duavee will be labeled to treat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ligand rose 7 percent to $47.99 at the close in New York,
            it's biggest gain in more than three months. Pfizer fell less
            than 1 percent to $28.77. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The most common side effects of Duavee in clinical trials
            were muscle spasms, nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, among
            others, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ligand, based in La Jolla, California, formed a research
            deal with Pfizer-acquired Wyeth, which developed the medicine.
            The FDA rejected bazedoxifene in 2009, after multiple delays, as
            an osteoporosis treatment on stroke and clotting concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duavee will have the same boxed warning as other estrogen
            products, the FDA said. Premarin warns against an increased risk
            of cancer of the uterus and of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Switzerland Seizes Bogus Pfizer Pills in Zurich Airport</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Swiss authorities seized more than 1
            million fake Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Xanax anti-anxiety pills at Zurich
            airport, part of a wider crackdown on counterfeit medicines
            posing a public-health threat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Four crates weighing more than 400 kilograms (880 pounds)
            were intercepted while in transit from China to Egypt and
            ordered to be destroyed after tests determined the pills
            contained no active ingredients, Bern-based Swissmedic, the
            country's drug regulator, said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Governments are fighting to safeguard the distribution of
            legitimate drugs and crack down on counterfeit products.
            Systematic checks of medical shipments are carried out every
            year, and imports of bogus medicines have been declining in
            Switzerland, Swissmedic said in June. Counterfeit drugs
            generated an estimated $75 billion in revenue in 2010, according
            to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm angry,' Erik Gordon, a professor of law and business
            at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, wrote in e-mailed
            comments. 'When criminals counterfeit Hermes scarves, money is
            stolen. When they counterfeit pills, they kill people.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each year more than 100,000 people around the world may die
            from substandard and counterfeit medications, according to an
            estimate by Amir Attaran, an associate professor at the
            University of Ottawa, and Roger Bate, an economist at the
            American Enterprise Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fake Xanax couldn't be recognized as counterfeit at
            first glance, said Swissmedic, whose official name is the Swiss
            Agency for Therapeutic Products. The regulator said it informed
            authorities abroad of the discovery, in particular in China and
            Egypt. No patients in Switzerland will be affected, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Swiss regulator said in June that it had already seized
            about 90 shipments this year representing a high-potential
            health risk. It also has ordered the shutdown of Internet
            websites trading drugs illegally. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Twitter, Pfizer, Prada, Kim Dotcom: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Profits aren't the only thing
            lacking at Twitter Inc. (TWTR) ahead of its planned initial public
            offering. It's got a dearth of patents, too. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The microblogging service said in its prospectus last week
            that it has nine issued U.S. patents. That compares with 774
            cited by Facebook Inc. before its initial public offering in May
            2012 and International Business Machines Corp.'s 6,478 patents
            accrued last year alone. Twitter's smaller patent trove reflects
            its philosophy of letting engineers and designers own their
            inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While that policy is meant to limit patent litigation, some
            investors and analysts are concerned it could backfire. Evidence
            shows that intellectual property can help companies raise more
            funds in their offerings, as patents enable investors to
            quantify the value of technological breakthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The lack of a large number of issued patents is a little
            concerning,' Maulin Shah, managing director at Envision IP LLC,
            an advisory and research firm in New York, said by phone. 'If
            Twitter does deal with patent-infringement lawsuits, they don't
            have too many patents to lean on to countersue. That does put
            Twitter at a disadvantage.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Twitter said in its prospectus that many competitors have
            'substantially larger patent' portfolios, which could make it
            a target for litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time, Twitter has said that too many patents
            may hinder innovation. In May, the San Francisco-based company
            implemented the Innovator's Patent Agreement, or IPA, to keep
            ownership of inventions in the hands of the people who created
            them. As part of the policy, Twitter can't pursue offensive
            litigation without the inventor's permission. The IPA ensures
            that the patents 'will be used only as a shield rather than as
            a weapon,' according to Twitter's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IPA will help the company lure and retain more talented
            engineers, said Robert Clarkson, a partner in the capital
            markets practice at law firm Jones Day. More than 5,000 patent
            actions were filed last year, the most ever recorded, according
            to a 2013 study by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The policy's biggest risk is that employees will take their
            inventions with them, posing a competitive threat if they leave,
            according to Jeff Sica, president and chief investment officer
            of Sica Wealth Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Prada SpA (PRDSY), the luxury fashion house, sued a New York
            perfume company for trademark infringement over a line of
            'designer inspired' fragrances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Preferred Fragrance Inc.'s 'Party Candy' has similar
            packaging and a name and is intended to convey a connection with
            the 'Prada Candy' line, according to a complaint filed Oct. 18
            in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Preferred Fragrance describes itself on its website as
            'the leading distributor of designer-inspired perfumes.' The
            company said it creates scents that 'combine the same premium
            quality of a designer fragrance with affordable pricing and mass
            availability.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has also been sued for trademark infringement
            by Elizabeth Arden Inc., Estee Lauder Inc. and Summit
            Entertainment Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'Prada Candy' line, which was introduced in August
            2011, is 'an elegant mix of white musks combined with a sensual
            balsamic vanilliac accord of benzoin and sweet caramel,'
            according to Prada. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Prada has sold 'tens of
            millions of dollars' worth of the product in the two years it
            has been on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prada is seeking court orders barring the use of 'Party
            Candy' as a trade name, the registration of the name as a U.S.
            trademark and sales of 'Party Candy' products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prada also asked for money damages, Preferred Fragrance's
            profits attributable to the alleged infringement, attorney fees
            and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Preferred Fragrance didn't respond to an e-mailed request
            for comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Prada v. Preferred Fragrance Inc., 13-cv-07371,
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;University of Illinois Settles Mascot Dispute, AP Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The University of Illinois and a group that honors the
            school's former mascot settled a dispute over the use of the
            mascot's name and official logo, the Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The school dropped the mascot -- Chief Illiniwek -- in 2007
            under pressure from the National Collegiate Athletic Association
            to quit using a symbol some considered a demeaning portrayal of
            American Indian culture, according to the AP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement bars the Honor the Chief Society from using
            Chief Illiniwek and his image, and the group must post a
            disclaimer on its website and promotional materials disavowing a
            connection to the university, the AP said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group can hold events with a performance in the nature
            of 'a choreographed tribe to the dance' that was performed by
            the mascot at school athletic events, the AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kim Dotcom's Mega Site Not Used by Pirates, CEO Tells Conference &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mega cloud storage system started in January by Kim
            Dotcom, who is accused of criminal copyright infringement, is
            mainly being used by professionals rather than pirates, Chief
            Executive Officer Vikram Kumar told London's conference on
            copyright and technology, the Guardian newspaper reported last
            week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kumar said that accountants, lawyers, financial advisers
            and architects are willing to pay to use Mega because of the
            company's end-to-end encryption technology, according to the
            newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said that very few -- around 100 per day -- of the
            service's 5 million customers are receiving takedown notices
            under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Guardian
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kumar said that the number is very small for any online
            service provider and that the company is working against
            external search engines that claim to be able to index files
            stored on the service, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Tops Estimates as Investors Await Possible Breakup</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest
            drugmaker, reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts'
            estimates as the company cut costs and sales of its top vaccine
            and pain drugs increased. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earnings (PFE) excluding one-time items were 58 cents a share, 2
            cents more than the average of 16 analysts' estimates compiled
            by Bloomberg. New York-based Pfizer raised the lower end of its
            full-year forecast range, excluding certain items, narrowing it
            to $2.15 to $2.20 a share from $2.10 to $2.20 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer is pushing to expand sales of Prevnar, a
            pneumococcal vaccine and its second-biggest product, since
            losing marketing exclusivity for Lipitor, once the world's top-selling drug. It also used proceeds from the
            divestiture of
            units to buy back stock and boost earnings per share. Investors
            are now looking for detail on whether Chief Executive Officer
            Ian Read will break the company into two or three pieces, keep
            them separately in-house or sell part. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Right now, we're focused on setting up the new
            organizational model,' Read said today on a conference call
            with investors. 'It's too early to speculate on the future
            developments of those businesses.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose 1.7 percent to $31.25 at 4 p.m. New York time,
            its highest price since October 2004. The shares have gained 23
            percent in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AstraZeneca Bullish Options Gain on Pfizer Comeback Bets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Traders are snapping up bullish options on AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), convinced the prospect of a
            takeover is still on the table even as U.S. lawmakers threaten to crack down on tax inversions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE), which withdrew a $116 billion proposal to buy the London drugmaker after merger
            talks collapsed in May, was allowed to renew the process as of last week, according to U.K. takeover rules.
            The cost of bullish options on AstraZeneca's (AZN) U.S. shares reached its highest level ever compared with
            bearish ones, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traders are speculating the plan still
            has life even as some U.S. lawmakers seek to limit takeovers allowing firms to circumvent tax bills. The
            bullish options show willingness to bet Pfizer will take another shot, said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's
            John Boris in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The time period has expired so it's logical that people would
            be speculating,' said Boris in an interview. 'Pfizer is staring at some pretty challenging times going
            forward, and as a result they have no alternative but to make an acquisition, and AstraZeneca is one of the
            acquisitions most speculated.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer has little to show for its research and
            development, and its business in the U.S., its biggest market, is shrinking. Since 2000, Pfizer has brought
            just three drugs to market that generate more than $1 billion in annual sales, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Pfizer's U.S. revenue was $20.3 billion in 2013, down from $21.3 billion in 2012 and $26.9
            billion in 2011, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Joins 32 States Seeking High Court Marriage Ruling</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Thirty prominent companies and 32
            states urged the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on gay marriage,
            adding to calls from both sides as the justices prepare in the
            coming weeks to say whether they will intervene. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies include Deutsche Bank AG (DB), eBay Inc., Pfizer
            Inc. (PFE), Target Corp. (TGT) and Viacom Inc. (VIA) In court papers filed this
            week, they said inconsistent state marriage laws posed a human-resources problem. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The different laws force companies to 'affirm
            discrimination we regard as injurious to our corporate missions
            and contrary to non-discrimination laws and policies,' the
            group said in court papers. The businesses includes Bloomberg
            LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Appeals in gay-marriage cases from Utah, Virginia and
            Oklahoma are likely to be before the justices when they meet
            Sept. 29 for a private conference in advance of the nine-month
            term that starts the following week. Under its practices from
            previous years, the court could act as quickly as Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The states weighing in are almost evenly divided in their
            laws. Colorado is leading a group of 17 states that ban gay
            marriage. That group said a Supreme Court ruling would 'stave
            off the increasing burden of same-sex marriage litigation
            against the states.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer Said to Approach Actavis to Gauge Interest in Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE) has approached Actavis Plc (ACT) to express its interest in an acquisition,
            people with knowledge of the matter said, as the U.S. drugmaker continues to explore ways to cut its tax
            rate and gain a new product pipeline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies aren't currently in formal talks and
            Pfizer hasn't made an offer, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is
            private. The approach comes after Pfizer in May abandoned a $114 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc -- which
            would also have let it move its tax domicile abroad in a so-called tax inversion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actavis,
            which is run from Parsippany, New Jersey, obtained an Irish tax domicile by acquiring Warner Chilcott Plc
            last year. Its shares rose 2.2 percent to $240.85 in New York trading today, giving Actavis a market value
            of about $63.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although AstraZeneca rebuffed its approach after Pfizer refused
            to pay the British company's price, the American drugs giant is still considering pursuing that deal as well
            as other options, the people said. The company has determined any such deal needs to be friendly, unlike the
            unsolicited offer made to Astra, these people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Representatives for Pfizer and
            Actavis declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. has approached Actavis Plc about a deal that could allow the U.S. drugmaker to move its
            address overseas and reduce taxes, in a sign the Obama administration's efforts to curtail inversions might
            fall short. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pfizer made its approach before the U.S. Treasury Department announced new
            rules Sept. 22 to make such deals -- called tax inversions -- more difficult, people with knowledge of the
            matter said. Those changes won't deter Pfizer, even if they are a complication, one of the people said,
            asking not to be identified discussing private information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another high-profile
            inversion deal, Burger King Worldwide Inc.'s purchase of Tim Hortons Inc., will proceed, the Canadian
            company said after the rule changes were revealed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How U.S. Companies Buy Tax Breaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While
            Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew could take further steps, he steered clear of putting an end to a key
            benefit of inversions, which allow companies to lower their U.S. earnings by shifting profits overseas using
            a technique known as earnings stripping. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The ability to shelter future foreign earnings
            from U.S. tax seems to be a principal objective and, as far as I can see, that benefit remains,' said Robert
            Willens, a corporate tax consultant in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Lung Cancer Drug Helps Patients With Gene Defect</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s Xalkori for advanced
            lung cancer shrunk tumors in those with a rare genetic mutation,
            according to a study that may provide the first targeted
            treatment for these patients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Xalkori reduced the size of tumors in 36 of 50 patients in
            the study while halting tumor growth in another nine, according
            to company-funded research released today at the European
            Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Madrid and online in the
            New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 15,000 people, or 1 percent of the estimated 1.5
            million annual new cases of non-small-cell lung cancer, have an
            abnormality to the ROS1 gene, according to New York-based
            Pfizer. Today's findings also showed that Xalkori was effective
            for about 18 months in patients, longer than the average eight
            to 12 months seen for some other targeted treatments, said Alice
            Shaw, a lead study author. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're seeing much longer durations of remissions,' Shaw,
            an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and
            Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said in a telephone
            interview. 'This points to being a very good target in lung
            cancer and this drug being a very effective targeted therapy for
            these patients.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Xalkori helps shut off the ROS1 gene that is causing cancer
            tumors to grow, she said. It was approved in 2011 to treat non-small-cell lung cancers in patients with
            mutations to the ALK
            gene, which has structural similarities to the ROS1 gene. The
            National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 25 cancer
            centers, already recommends that doctors use Xalkori in patients
            who have this gene defect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Testing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pfizer continues to support clinical research of Xalkori
            in patients with ROS1 rearrangements to better understand the
            compound's activity in this population,' Sally Beatty, a
            company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cancer drug generated $282 million in 2013 sales,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drug may produce
            revenue of more than $812 million in 2017, according to the
            average of five analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patients with a mutation to the ROS1 gene are often younger
            and usually aren't smokers, Shaw said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's study is an expansion of the original Phase 1
            clinical trial of Xalkori in patients with the ALK gene
            mutation. Researchers enrolled 50 patients who were ROS1
            positive starting in late 2010 through August 2013. Those in the
            study received Xalkori two times daily. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By the end of the trial, half of the patients were still
            getting Xalkori and had no signs of their tumors growing, the
            authors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're hopeful that because of showing how well this drug
            works in ROS1 patients, this will let pathologists know they
            need to screen their patients for this genetic abnormality,'
            Shaw said. 'In lung cancer there's been a lot of progress made
            in targeted therapies.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pfizer's Premarin for Menopause Linked to Blood Clot Risk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Inc. (PFE)'s Premarin for
            menopause may be tied to a higher risk of blood clots than
            another common estrogen treatment called estradiol, a study
            found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Women taking Premarin, also known as conjugated equine
            estrogens, had double the risk of a blood clot in the veins than
            women taking estradiol, a synthetic form of estrogen, according
            to research today in JAMA Internal Medicine. No difference
            between the treatments was seen in the risk of stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's findings don't mean women should stop taking
            Premarin, an estrogen gathered from the urine of pregnant
            horses, to ease their menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes,
            night sweats, mood swings and vaginal dryness, said Nicholas
            Smith, the lead study author. More research is needed to
            replicate the results so doctors can say for sure that different
            types of estrogen drugs carry varied levels of heart risks, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The assumption has held that all oral estrogens have
            similar safety profiles. This may not be the case,' Smith, a
            professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington School
            of Public Health in Seattle, said in an e-mail. 'More
            comparative safety studies of commonly used treatments are
            needed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the study included 384 post-menopausal women
            ages 30 to 79 who were taking hormone treatments and were part
            of the heart and vascular health study with Group Health
            Cooperative, a health-care system in Washington state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Study Findings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From January 2003 to December 2009, 68 women developed
            blood clots, including 39 who used Premarin, 67 had a heart
            attack, including 38 who used Premarin, and 48 had a stroke,
            including 25 who used Premarin. Those women were matched with
            201 patients who didn't have any heart events and were current
            estrogen users. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the research showed the risk of having a heart attack
            for Premarin users was higher than those taking estradiol, the
            findings weren't statistically significant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfizer 'strongly believes' in the use of conjugated
            estrogens as a treatment option for women who have moderate to
            severe menopausal symptoms, Jennifer Kokell, a company
            spokeswoman, said in a statement. Premarin generated $1.07
            billion in sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Conjugated estrogens have been used for over 70 years as
            an effective treatment option for women experiencing menopausal
            symptoms,' Kokell said. 'Pfizer remains committed to helping
            meet the needs of women going through menopause.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Women should use hormones at the lowest dose for the
            shortest amount of time, according to U.S. recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Health Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took New York-based Pfizer's
            Premarin and Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin,
            to treat their menopausal symptoms before they were linked in
            2002 to health concerns such as breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Women's Health Initiative, a U.S.-sponsored study of
            disease and disability in postmenopausal women, was halted in
            2002 after finding that women who took Pfizer's Prempro had a
            higher breast-cancer risk. That led to a decline in sales of
            hormone replacement therapy pills. The Women's Health Initiative
            Estrogen-Alone Trial was stopped in 2004, a year earlier than
            planned, because of an increased risk of stroke. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration says that women shouldn't
            use hormone therapy to prevent heart attacks and strokes or
            memory loss and Alzheimer's disease. Studies also haven't shown
            the treatments prevent aging and wrinkles or increase sex drive,
            the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hormone treatments may help relieve menopausal symptoms and
            reduce a woman's chance of getting osteoporosis, according to
            the FDA. Still the drugs may raise the chance a woman gets blood
            clots, heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer and gall bladder
            disease. Women who have a uterus and take estrogen may have a
            higher risk of cancer of the uterine lining, the FDA said. &lt;/p&gt;
