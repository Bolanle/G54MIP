        <headline>JPMorgan to Invest in Junk Bonds for New Reinsurer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will manage
            funds for a Bermuda-based reinsurer that raised $1.13 billion in
            capital, concentrating the investments in junk bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Highbridge Principal Strategies LLC will oversee
            the assets for Watford Re Ltd., the reinsurer said yesterday in
            a statement. Watford said it raised $907 million in common
            equity, including a $100 million investment by Arch Capital
            Group Ltd., and $226 million in preferred shares. The reinsurer
            is targeting an initial public offering in two to three years,
            Chief Executive Officer John Rathgeber said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reinsurer's portfolio will be 'comprised primarily of
            non-investment grade credit assets, which it believes will
            generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders
            over the long term,' Watford said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money managers including Dan Loeb have started Bermuda-based reinsurers in recent years to raise
            funds that are less
            subject to client withdrawals and can provide tax advantages.
            Pine River Capital Management LP, the hedge-fund firm founded by
            Brian Taylor, was seeking to raise $500 million to $750 million
            for a reinsurance company, a person familiar with the matter
            said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, owns Highbridge
            through its investment arm, JPMorgan Asset Management.
            Highbridge Principal Strategies is led by Chief Executive
            Officer Scott Kapnick, who came to the firm in 2007 after 21
            years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was global co-head
            of investment banking. HPS had about $19 billion of assets under
            management as of March, Watford said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Casualty Coverage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rathgeber was vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance
            Group. Jon Levy was named chief risk officer and Roderick Romeo
            will be chief financial officer. Reinsurers shoulder risk for
            primary carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Management is aiming for annualized returns of about 15
            percent over time, Rathgeber said. He plans to focus on casualty
            lines such as automobile liability, workers' compensation and
            medical malpractice coverage while limiting risks tied to
            natural disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It wouldn't make sense to have this kind of investment
            strategy and be heavily into that kind of volatile, capital-intensive reinsurance exposure,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Constantine Iordanou, the CEO of Bermuda-based Arch
            Capital, has been diversifying risk through deals including an
            agreement last year to add assets from bankrupt mortgage insurer
            PMI Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arch slipped 0.8 percent to $57.07 at 10:17 a.m. in New
            York, narrowing its gain to about 8.6 percent over the past
            year. JPMorgan climbed 0.3 percent and is up 27 percent in the
            past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Junk-rated corporate debt worldwide returned 2.9 percent
            since Dec. 31, beating global stocks and setting the stage for a
            sixth year of gains, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            index data. The bonds now yield 6.1 percent, compared with an
            average of about 10 percent in the decade through 2007. Junk
            bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt rated below BBB-by Standard
            Poor's and lower than Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe that non-investment-grade credit complements
            Watford's reinsurance strategy,' Purnima Puri, HPS's managing
            director, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan advised on the capital structuring,
            and Clifford Chance LLP was Watford's outside counsel. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Avolon Said to Hire Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan for Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Avolon Aerospace Leasing Ltd., the
            private-equity backed aircraft financing company, has hired
            JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley to explore a possible
            initial public offering or sale, according to people familiar
            with its plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avolon, owned by Oak Hill Capital Partners LP, Cinven Ltd.,
            and CVC Capital Partners Ltd., may seek a U.S. listing should it
            opt for an IPO, said one of the people, who asked not to be
            named because the discussions are private. The company, with the
            youngest fleet of any large aircraft lessor and 198 planes in
            its portfolio and on order, also counts Singapore's sovereign
            wealth fund among its investors, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avolon Chief Executive Officer Domhnal Slattery said last
            year he was encouraged by transactions including Sumitomo Mitsui
            Financial Group Inc.'s $7.3 billion purchase of Royal Bank of
            Scotland Group Plc's aviation unit and that he would explore
            strategic options as early as 2014. Companies in Europe have
            raised about $17 billion in IPOs this year, more than triple
            what they did a year earlier in the same period, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives for Avolon, based in Dublin, Oak Hill,
            Cinven, CVC, Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growing Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Airfinance Journal reported earlier today that Avolon and
            lessor Awas Aviation Capital Ltd. are exploring options for a
            sale, with Awas hiring Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc. It didn't identify bankers hired by Avolon to explore
            options. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Airlines buying large commercial aircraft will require $100
            billion in financing this year, according to Avolon estimates.
            Lessors make up about 40 percent of the aircraft financing
            market now, a figure that is set to rise in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To support growth, the companies rely increasingly on
            external funding, including capital markets, and transactions
            including lessors have picked up. In December, AerCap Holdings
            NV (AER) agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp. from American
            International Group Inc. for $15 billion to create a lessor
            rivaling General Electric Co.'s Gecas unit for size. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avolon has raised $7.2 billion in capital since its launch,
            with its four owners putting in $1.4 billion in equity
            investments. Its most recent financing closed last month, when
            it secured a $500 million debt facility to finance aircraft
            purchases this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mubadala Development Co., Abu Dhabi's investment and
            development company, is considering an initial public offering
            for its Swiss SR Technics aircraft-maintenance business, people
            with knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other lessor transactions in the last 24 months include the
            purchase of Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)'s Jackson Square Aviation
            to Mitsubishi UFJ Lease Finance Co. for about $1.1 billion,
            and Babcock Brown Aircraft Management's sale of a 50 percent
            stake in December 2012 to Onex Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slattery himself previously set up the RBS aircraft leasing
            division, and left three years before it was sold to Sumitomo.
            Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte agreed to enter Avolon
            as a shareholder in October 2011, a little more than a year
            after the lessor's formation in May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for GIC did not immediately respond to
            telephone requests seeking comment outside of regular business
            hours. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Wins Round in Dexia SA Mortgage-Bond Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, defeated most of a lawsuit brought by Dexia SA over
            about $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed securities it bought
            before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan narrowed the
            case to five securitization deals from 65 at issue in a
            complaint brought by Dexia, according to an order filed today.
            Rakoff said he would issue an opinion later explaining his
            reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dexia, based in Brussels, sued JPMorgan in 2012 along with
            the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual businesses JPMorgan
            acquired, accusing the lender of 'egregious fraud' in the sale
            of mortgage bonds. Dexia claimed loans backing securities
            purchased between 2005 and 2007 were riskier than promised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dexia (DEXB) unit FSA Asset Management LLC said in court papers
            that JPMorgan received reports from independent mortgage-loan
            underwriters showing that 20 percent to 80 percent of the loans
            in samples used for testing didn't meet the underwriting
            guidelines, including fraudulent home appraisals or missing
            documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Rather than disclose these known defects to FSAM,
            defendants bought and sold massive quantities of defective
            loans,' FSAM said. 'Defendants secretly overrode the
            independent loan underwriters' determinations, creating a final,
            sanitized version.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rakoff granted part of JPMorgan's motion for a pre-trial
            ruling known as summary judgment. The judge dismissed claims
            brought by Dexia and said FSAM can pursue claims related to five
            securitizations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, didn't immediately comment about the decision. A
            lawyer for Dexia couldn't be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns Co., 12-cv-04761.
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells 401(k) Recordkeeping to Great-West Lifeco</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. lender, agreed to sell its large-market 401(k)
            recordkeeping business to a division of Canadian life insurer
            Great-West Lifeco (GWO) Inc. Terms of the transaction weren't
            disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal will make Great-West the second-largest
            recordkeeper of 401(k)-type retirement plans by participants,
            serving 6.8 million workers with a combined $387 billion in
            assets, the company said today in a statement from Winnipeg,
            Canada. The largest provider of retirement recordkeeping
            services, which include sending out account statements and other
            communications to participants, is Boston-based Fidelity
            Investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose recordkeeping business lags behind those of
            firms such as Fidelity, Vanguard Group Inc. and Prudential
            Financial Inc., is selling its unit as recordkeeping for
            workers' retirement accounts has become less lucrative for firms
            that don't have scale. The deal will catapult Great-West from
            the seventh-largest recordkeeper of 401(k)-type plans by assets
            in 2012, according to research firm Cerulli Associates, allowing
            it to compete with the biggest firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bringing together these platforms allows us to be a
            market leader,' said Robert Reynolds, who was named last month
            as president and chief executive officer of Great-West Lifeco
            U.S., which owns Great-West Financial and Putnam Investments.
            'You can make money in this business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Top Priorities' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale is a shift for New York-based JPMorgan, whose head
            of retirement, Michael Falcon, said in March 2011 that getting a
            bigger share of retirement assets was 'one of the top
            priorities' at the bank. JPMorgan at the time had roughly
            doubled its sales force dedicated to retirement plans including
            pitches for its recordkeeping services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's not easy to see anything like this,' Falcon, head
            of retirement at JPMorgan's asset-management unit, said in an
            interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will continue to sell investments to retirement
            plans, Falcon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a large and growing business on the investment
            side,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Americans held $23 trillion in retirement assets as of Dec.
            31, of which $4.2 trillion was in 401(k) plans. Administrators
            of 401(k)s are paid for their recordkeeping service also may
            make money from investments in the plan if they are managed by
            their own firm or through arrangements with other money managers
            known as revenue-sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cross-Selling &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many recordkeepers also see the administration of 401(k)
            accounts as an avenue for cross-selling other products to
            workers such as individual retirement accounts when they retire
            or change jobs. Those accounts usually have higher fees,
            according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability
            Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proliferation of lower-fee products and more cost-conscious employers have contributed to
            declining expenses for
            401(k) investments over the past 15 years, data compiled by the
            Washington-based Investment Company Institute show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to close during the third
            quarter of this year pending regulatory approval. More than
            1,000 employees of JPMorgan's retirement-services unit will move
            to Great-West. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal won't 'have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase's
            earnings, according to the bank's statement. The two companies
            said workers with accounts administered by JPMorgan should
            expect no disruption. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Unblocks Russian Payment to Sanctioned Bank's Affiliate</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is unfreezing a
            money transfer from a Russian embassy in Central Asia to an
            insurer linked to U.S.-sanctioned bank after getting a go-ahead
            from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Following consultation with our regulators, we are
            processing this transaction,' JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reversal comes two days after Russia's Foreign Ministry
            decried the move by the biggest U.S. bank blocking a payment
            from its embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan, to Sogaz Insurance Group
            as 'illegal and absurd.' Sogaz is part-owned by OAO Bank
            Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender under U.S. sanctions
            relating to the Ukraine crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama announced the action against
            Bank Rossiya last month as part of a broadening of sanctions
            that targeted government officials and allies of Russian
            President Vladimir Putin, whose associates own Bank Rossiya. The
            embassy's transaction was for less than $5,000, a person with
            knowledge of the dispute said, asking not to be identified
            because such transfers aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry said 'the hostile action' by
            JPMorgan bank was 'a grossest violation of international law,'
            according to its April 1 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Bank Rossiya unit reduced its stake in Sogaz to 48.5
            percent from 51 percent on March 11, according to a regulatory
            disclosure on the insurer's website. The U.S. added Bank Rossiya
            and its billionaire shareholder Yury Kovalchuk to an extended
            sanctions list on March 20 following Russia's annexation of
            Crimea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's Finance Ministry picked JPMorgan last year to help
            improve the country's standing among U.S. credit-rating firms.
            The bank was also short-listed to advise on the government's
            privatization program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As with all U.S. financial institutions that operate
            globally, we are subject to specific regulatory requirements,'
            New York-based JPMorgan said in an April 1 statement. 'We will
            continue to seek guidance from the U.S. government on
            implementing their recent sanctions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Largest Note Tied to Indian Rupee in 40 Months</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $24.1
            million of notes tied to the Indian rupee, the largest such
            offering since November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The one-year securities, issued March 28, yield a maximum
            of 16.3 percent if called after 12 months, according to a
            prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission. If the Indian currency strengthens at all or
            depreciates no more than 1.5 percent by quarterly intervals, the
            bank will automatically redeem the notes. Investors suffer
            losses if the rupee drops more than 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The South Asian country's currency gained 3.1 percent to
            59.89 per U.S. dollar during the first three months of the year,
            its biggest quarterly advance since September 2012. The currency
            strengthened because India raised interest rates and changed
            regulations to make it easier for foreigners to invest there,
            said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market strategy at Brown
            Brothers Harriman Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'India hiked rates, delivering several hawkish surprises
            last year,' Thin said in a telephone interview. The rupee could
            strengthen to around 58 per dollar in about three months, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee reached an eight-month high on March 28. It's the
            third-best performing emerging-market currency against the
            greenback, advancing 2.7 percent this year as of 5:48 p.m. in
            New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign investors have bought $11.1 billion of Indian
            stocks and bonds this year through April 2, the most among eight
            Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rates Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India kept its benchmark repurchase
            rate unchanged at 8 percent at an April 1 review after lifting
            it 0.75 percentage point since September to counter price gains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, didn't
            respond to messages seeking comment about the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. sold $50 million of six-month notes linked
            to the rupee on November 12, 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
            values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Probably Join Morgan Stanley on Mall IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will probably
            join Morgan Stanley (MS) as global coordinator on the initial public
            offering of Emaar Properties PJSC's (EMAAR) shopping malls and retail
            business, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks were informally hired, though no documents have
            yet been signed, said the people, who asked not to be named
            because the information is private. Emaar is also appointing
            lead managers for the sale, the people said. An official at
            Emaar who didn't want to be identified said no advisers have
            been appointed. Spokesmen for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emaar, developer of the world's tallest tower in Dubai,
            hired Morgan Stanley to advise on what will be the largest share
            sale in the Middle East and Africa since 2008, Chairman Mohamed Alabbar said in a March 18 interview. The
            company plans to raise
            8 billion dirhams ($2.2 billion) to 9 billion dirhams from the
            sale as a tourism boom adds to retail sales in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern companies are taking advantage of rebounding
            stock markets and asset prices to raise funds through IPOs and
            secondary offerings. Emirates Reit, the United Arab Emirates'
            first real-estate investment trust, said last week it increased
            its share sale to $175 million to accommodate investor demand
            for Dubai's first IPO for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank Said to Manage Potential Greek Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Greece tapped JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            and Deutsche Bank AG to manage an expected debt offering as it
            seeks a return to the capital markets, according to people with
            knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms will underwrite the deal as the nation with the
            worst jobless rate in the euro area attempts to sell bonds for
            the first time since being shut out in early 2010, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
            authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greece's Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras suggested last
            week that the government would issue notes in the first half of
            2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growing confidence among officials on the prospect of
            selling debt has risen as bond yields have fallen to a four-year
            low. Their optimism rests on the premise of persuading investors
            that Greece will shake off a six-year recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Greek 10-year bonds has dropped below 6.2
            percent from more than 30 percent in 2012. Greek securities have
            returned 31 percent this year, the best performance among the 34
            sovereign debt markets tracked by the Bloomberg World Bond
            Indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Germany has welcomed the planned bond sale as evidence that
            'confidence of the financial markets is returning' to Greece,
            Nadine Kalwey, a spokeswoman for Germany's Finance Ministry,
            said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greece's financing situation has already benefited from a
            budget surplus before interest costs of almost 3 billion euros
            ($4.1 billion), which the government expects the European
            Union's statistics agency to confirm this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, three officials said that the government planned
            to sell 2 billion euros of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase Co. and the U.K.'s
            Department for International Development will contribute a
            combined $20 million to a private-equity fund investing in
            startup businesses operating in East Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DFID's Impact Fund, which is managed by CDC Group, a
            development finance institution owned by the U.K. government,
            will provide $15 million to Novastar Ventures and JPMorgan the
            rest, the companies said today in an e-mailed statement. The
            money will finance health care, education, housing, energy and
            sanitation projects that are expected to reach as many as 2
            million people over the next decade, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Private sector capital is crucial to economic growth in
            East Africa,' Peter Scher, head of corporate responsibility at
            JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. 'There
            is a recognition that governmental and aid organizations cannot
            do this alone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should accelerate investments to build
            infrastructure in Africa and form public-private partnerships
            that will help improve economic and social conditions, Kenyan
            President Uhuru Kenyatta said on April 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It marks the first investment released from the 75 million-pound ($124 million) Impact Fund
            announced by the U.K. in 2012
            to provide capital to companies and programs that will generate
            returns in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Social Good &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novastar is focusing its investments on 'early-stage
            businesses that offer massive social benefits to low-income
            households,' Managing Director Steve Beck said on April 5 by
            phone from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Novastar will accelerate the existing investment program
            of SpringHill Equity Partners, an informal investor circle that
            has been making venture investments in East Africa,' Beck said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novastar in March made its initial investment in Bridge
            International Academies, which has built more than 250 schools
            in Kenya, according to the statement. The Nairobi-based chain of
            nursery and primary schools charges students an average of $5 a
            month, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Market-based approaches, along with interested investors,
            can attract the private sector capital necessary to create
            change,' Scher said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private equity funds invested more than three times as much
            in sub-Saharan Africa last year as they did in 2012 as the
            number of deals during the period rose to 84 from 58, according
            to the 2014 East Africa Private Equity Confidence Survey
            released by Deloitte. In East Africa, the number of deals in
            Kenya last year was 12, five in Rwanda, and three each in Uganda
            and Tanzania, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Buys NYC Office for $2.05 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
            executive officer of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), bought a commercial
            co-op unit on the ground floor of his Manhattan apartment
            building for $2.05 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, and his wife, Judy, completed the purchase of
            the property at 1185 Park Ave. on March 22, according to records
            made public today by the New York City Department of Finance.
            The couple own a 16th-floor residence in the building. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sellers of the commercial co-op were listed as Stephen
            Marks and George Ellis, cardiologists whose practice was located
            at the address. The unit is one of 11 on the ground floor of the
            building, located between 93rd and 94th Streets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're professional offices' said Jonathan Miller,
            president of New York-based appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. 'Most
            of the time it's a doctor, a psychologist, any type of medical
            practice. It's not uncommon for it to be a place to write a
            book, or just a place to work, or have a private office.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miller's firm has appraised other ground-floor offices in
            the building. He wasn't involved in Dimon's deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniela Kunen, a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate
            who listed the property for sale, didn't immediately return a
            telephone message seeking comment on the deal. Mark Kornblau, a
            JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) investors risk
            shortening Jamie Dimon's tenure as chief executive officer if
            they appoint a separate chairman to help lead the bank,
            according to Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the board is forced by a shareholder vote to strip
            Jamie Dimon of his chairman's role, then shareholders may find
            that Jamie Dimon decides to move on, maybe not immediately but
            within the year,' Peabody wrote in a note to clients today.
            'If that were to occur, is there someone with Mr. Dimon's
            talents capable of stepping into the breach?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon, 57, to give up the chairmanship have been
            building since the bank disclosed risk-control lapses on
            derivatives bets last year that fueled more than $6.2 billion in
            losses. In March, the New York-based firm's board urged
            investors to vote against naming a separate chairman at the next
            shareholder meeting, saying that Dimon's dual role remains the
            'most effective leadership model.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon told investors in February that he wouldn't have
            agreed to take a previous job, leading Bank One Corp., if the
            board hadn't given him both roles, Peabody recalled. JPMorgan
            acquired Bank One in 2004 to create the company it is today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Job Cuts as Banks Seek to Bolster Profit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Rising stock prices, rebounding profits, restored dividends and a growing economy are signaling to
            U.S. banks it's time for more job cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even after the industry posted its best results
            since 2006, the six largest U.S. banks announced plans in the first three months of this year to eliminate
            about 21,000 positions, or 1.8 percent of their combined workforce, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            That's the most since 2011's third quarter. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), whose 259,000 people produced three
            straight years of record profit, topped the list with 17,000 reductions scheduled by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are under pressure to keep profit climbing amid weak revenue growth, and employees are among
            the biggest expenses after interest costs. The most vulnerable people work in units where demand is waning
            such as mortgage foreclosures. Their departures would come on top of 320,000 jobs culled from U.S. financial
            companies in the past five years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They have a better feel for what their
            business model looks like and they are starting to align headcount,' said Robert Dicks, a principal at
            Deloitte Touche LLP in New York who advises financial firms on staffing. 'We were out of whack for a couple
            of years, but we're balanced right now.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Go Daddy Operating Co., the website
            registration and hosting company, has picked Morgan Stanley (MS) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. to manage an initial public offering this
            year, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Go Daddy, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, is aiming to be
            public in the fall, one of the people said, asking not to be
            identified discussing private information. The size of the
            offering hasn't been determined, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, which has raised its profile in recent years
            with an advertising campaign featuring celebrities like race-car
            driver Danica Patrick and Israeli model Bar Refaeli, is enjoying
            high levels of customer retention and strong subscriber growth,
            according to Moody's Investors Service. Chief Executive Officer
            Blake Irving said in a July interview that sales could reach $5
            billion in two or three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Go Daddy's sales in the year through June were about $1
            billion, Moody's said. Irving said in the interview that Go
            Daddy could approach public markets as soon as this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment firms KKR Co., Silver Lake Management LLC and

        <headline>Dimon Says JPMorgan Had 'Tin Ear' Dealing With Regulators</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; April 9 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, had a 'tin ear' when dealing with
            regulators before settling probes into mortgage lapses and
            trading losses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our response generally was, 'We know what we're doing,''
            Dimon wrote today in a letter to the New York-based bank's
            investors. 'Well, we should have done more self-examination. We
            need to be better listeners.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon is seeking to improve relations with overseers after
            lamenting in prior years that regulation could thwart growth.
            JPMorgan's earnings last year were marred by more than $20
            billion in legal settlements that contributed to the first
            quarterly loss under Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank missed signals when rivals faced scrutiny and must
            'do a better job at examining critiques of others so we can
            learn from other people's mistakes, too,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Says Cyber Intruders Could Breach Bank Defenses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is facing
            'increasingly complex and more dangerous' cyberattacks and
            some of the intruders may get through, Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is going to be a continual and likely never-ending
            battle to stay ahead of it -- and, unfortunately, not every
            battle will be won,' Dimon wrote today in his annual letter to
            shareholders of the New York-based bank. The company will boost
            spending on cybersecurity to $250 million this year from $200
            million in 2012, with future efforts expanding
            'exponentially,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global corporations have increased their focus on how to
            repel hackers since breaches were revealed by retailers
            including Target Corp. (TGT) JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets, is building three cybersecurity operations centers in
            regional headquarters to coordinate information and respond to
            threats, Dimon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators have pressed lenders to strengthen measures
            against cyber intrusions, and Richard Davis, the CEO at U.S.
            Bancorp, said in November that when a cyberattack does succeed
            against a bank, the impact probably will be big. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond traders at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Scotland Group

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Ben Morganstein and Inga Norton, Morgan Stanley's Nicholas Bonacci, and Adam Siegel of
            RBS were told not to come to work, the people said, asking for anonymity because the matter is private. It's
            unclear why or if the actions are connected, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Jefferies Group LLC
            bond trader Jesse Litvak, 39, was convicted last month of securities fraud for lying to clients about what
            he charged them to trade mortgage bonds. Other banks including New York-based JPMorgan received requests for
            information from U.S. officials about mortgage-bond trading after Litvak's arrest, people briefed on the
            matter said in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter, reported earlier
            today that Morganstein and Siegel had been placed on leave. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norton, Morganstein and

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said first-quarter profit fell 19 percent on lower
            revenue from fixed-income trading and mortgages, themes that may be repeated across Wall Street next week.
            The shares declined 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 a share,
            from $6.53 billion, or $1.59, a year earlier, according to a statement today from New York-based JPMorgan.
            Ten analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $1.46 a share on average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the
            first of the top U.S. banks to post results for the period, said profit fell in every major division, amid a
            42 percent drop in mortgage revenue and a 21 percent slide in fixed-income trading. Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon, 58, warned investors in February that trading had fallen 15 percent for the first two months of
            2014, a decline analysts including David Konrad of Macquarie Group Ltd. blamed on a reduction in the Federal
            Reserve's bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) tumbled as much as 5 percent, the most in 17 months, after reporting

            a.m., after dropping to $54.55 earlier today. Excluding one-time items, profit at the New York-based company
            was $1.35 a share, David Konrad of Macquarie Group Ltd. said today in a note, falling short of the $1.46

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JBS SA (JBSS3), the world's largest beef
            producer, hired units of JPMorgan Chase Co. and Banco Bradesco
            SA for a 3 billion-real ($1.3 billion) initial public offering
            of its poultry and processed food unit, according to two people
            with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander
            SA (SAN), Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the
            share offering of JBS Foods, the people said, asking not to be
            identified because negotiations are confidential. The timing of
            the sale will depend on market conditions, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exame magazine reported the hiring of the banks on April 10.
            JBS, Banco do Brasil, Santander, JPMorgan, Itau BBA, Bradesco

            &lt;p&gt;JBS Foods, the second-largest producer and exporter of

            Seara food processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods SA for
            5.85 billion reais in June 2013. Seara sales totaled 7.1 billion
            reais in 2012, according to Marfrig regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IPO would help unlock value by separating the unit from
            the parent company, a third person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Carl Levin said he
            plans to forward results from his panel's nine-month
            investigation into JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s record trading loss to
            the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to
            review for possible wrongdoing by company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When you say criminal referrals, there will be referrals
            to the Justice Department and to the regulators, the Securities
            and Exchange Commission,' Levin, chairman of the Senate
            Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said today in an
            interview on Bloomberg Television's 'Political Capital With Al Hunt.' 'We've laid out hundreds of pages of
            what I consider to
            be wrongful practices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The committee said last month that New York-based JPMorgan,
            led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, dodged regulators
            and misled investors as losses swelled on a derivatives bet by a
            trader known as the London Whale because of the size of his
            bets. Managers at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, manipulated
            risk models and pressured traders to overvalue their positions
            in an effort to hide growing losses, according to the
            committee's report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said referrals to the
            Justice Department and the SEC are 'fairly routine' following
            a review by his panel and, if staff hasn't already sent their
            report to investigators, they should. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While he wouldn't say whether he believed there was
            criminal activity at JPMorgan, Levin said, 'I'm very
            disappointed, though, that there has not been action taken
            criminally against some of the higher-ups' on Wall Street,
            declining to name individual companies or executives. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan 33% Profit Jump Beats Estimates on Reserve Releases</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s first- quarter profit rose 33 percent to a record on expense reductions
            and an improvement in consumer credit quality that allowed the bank to boost earnings by reducing loan-loss
            reserves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income climbed to $6.53 billion, or $1.59 a share, from
            $4.92 billion, or $1.19, in the same period a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
            statement. Twenty-eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated earnings per share of $1.39 adjusted for a
            one-time accounting item. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, lifted
            profit by shrinking expenses 16 percent, as he grappled with a 4 percent reduction in total net revenue.
            Earnings also were buoyed by a drop in late payments, which helped the consumer bank reduce its loan-loss
            reserve by $1.2 billion. The shares fell 0.6 percent as some analysts questioned whether JPMorgan can
            continue posting record earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The reserve releases aren't sustainable,' said
            Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales Partners in New York. Profits on interest-bearing investments 'are
            shrinking still, that's not healthy. Mortgage banking is going to get weaker from here.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peabody
            estimates that the reserve releases, a tax-benefit and a one-time accounting adjustment resulted in about 26
            cents per share of 'non-quality' earnings in the quarter, without which JPMorgan would have missed
            estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

            After three straight years of posting record net income, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is cutting

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and investment bank set aside 7 percent less money for
            employee compensation in the first quarter while the division generated 9 percent more revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $3.38 billion in compensation costs amounted to 34 percent of revenue, excluding
            accounting adjustments, down from 35 percent a year earlier, according to figures posted today on the New
            York-based firm's website. The pay pool is large enough to give each of the division's 51,634 employees
            $65,383 for the three months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investment banks have faced pressure to cut costs as
            revenue from trading, advisory and underwriting at the nine largest global firms fell almost 10 percent from
            2010 through 2012. Executives have sought to lower compensation-to-revenue ratios while retaining top
            bankers and traders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We really believe in pay for performance,' Mike Cavanagh, co-head
            of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, told shareholders in February. The bank's scale can help it
            keep that ratio low while offering top employees pay that's at least as good as 'anybody else in our
            industry,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm's corporate bank
            and treasury and securities-services units last year, and put Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto in charge of the
            division. The group has more than twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Switches Risk Model Again After Whale Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), whose trading
            loss of more than $6.2 billion last year was fueled by the
            adoption of a formula that understated risks, has adopted yet
            another model. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today it employed a new formula to judge the
            risk of its credit derivatives position, at least the fourth
            such model it's used since January 2012. The portfolio was built
            by Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his bets were
            so big they moved markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank changed its measurement of value at risk, or VaR,
            for the credit derivatives book in the first quarter of this
            year 'to achieve consistency with like products' within the
            corporate and investment bank, JPMorgan said today in a
            supplement. 'This change had an insignificant impact' to
            average VaR for fixed income and the investment bank's trading
            and credit portfolio, the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously changed the VaR model, which
            estimates the most amount of money a trading position can lose
            on 95 percent of the trading days, when the corporate and
            investment bank took over most of the credit book from the chief
            investment office last year. That change last year reduced
            JPMorgan's estimated risk by 24 percent to $115 million in the
            third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Targeting Gulf Leaps to No. 2 for Bonds: Arab Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. is gaining
            ground in the debt markets of Gulf Cooperation Council states
            after the biggest U.S. bank helped manage this month's Islamic
            bond sale by Saudi Arabia's utility. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest bond underwriter after HSBC
            Holdings Plc (HSBA) in the six-nation GCC in 2014, its best start to a
            year since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            New York-based lender advised on six deals, including Saudi
            Electricity (SECO) Co.'s $2.5 billion sukuk sale on April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Its jump from sixth place in the rankings at the end of
            2013 partly reflects the rise of Islamic finance, which will
            become a $2.7 trillion market by 2017, according to
            PricewaterhouseCoopers. Sukuk made up more than 70 percent of
            total bond issuance this year in the GCC, which supplies one-fifth of world oil, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Islamic finance now has the biggest slice of the bond
            market,' Samer Mardini, a vice president of fixed income at SJS
            Markets Ltd. in Dubai, said in a phone interview yesterday.
            'Issuers are more comfortable with big names like JPMorgan.
            They can act as market-makers and bookrunners to ensure a
            successful issuance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired former UBS AG banker Hussein Hassan last
            year to head global Shariah-compliant financing. It has also
            'intensified its focus on corporate clients' needs in the Gulf
            region over the past few years,' Hani Deaibes, head of Middle
            East and North Africa debt capital markets at the bank, said in
            an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rate Clarity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This effort, combined with more market certainty, has
            better positioned us to assist them in raising funding across
            the international and domestic markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;International bond-market conditions have become
            'conducive' since the start of the year as the U.S. Federal
            Reserve provided more clarity on interest rates, encouraging
            companies to raise long-term funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Electricity raised $1 billion in 30-year sukuk and
            $1.5 billion in 10-year securities. HSBC and Deutsche Bank AG
            also worked on the transaction. Deutsche Bank is the region's
            third-biggest underwriter this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The GCC has become a battleground for international banks
            as other parts of the Middle East and North Africa struggle to
            recover from political turmoil following a series of popular
            uprisings that first erupted in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Economic growth in the oil-rich Gulf region is set to
            accelerate to 4.4 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent
            for non-oil producers, according to HSBC forecasts released in
            January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sales Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's performance has come even as bond sales dropped
            almost 50 percent this year to $8 billion as some regular
            issuers, such as cash-flushed banks, refrain from tapping the
            market and offer cheaper loans to companies, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
            of Islamic structuring for UBS, is focusing on clients in
            countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
            e-mailed statement at the time of his appointment in January
            2013. Malaysia hosts the world's biggest market for Islamic
            bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts the world's biggest
            share of Shariah-compliant assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More Saudi borrowers may still issue debt after Fitch
            Ratings upgraded the kingdom one level in March to AA, the
            third-highest investment grade, according to John Sfakianakis,
            chief investment strategist at MASIC in Riyadh. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The recent sovereign upgrade should also help issuers who
            are looking for more competitive pricing,' he said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. Economic
            growth in Saudi
            Arabia may accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2014, from 3.8 percent a
            year earlier, according to economists' estimates provided to
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has helped arrange bond sales for Saudi Arabia's
            National Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, Qatar
            National Bank QD, as well as Kuwait Projects Co., data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At the end of the day, it's all about being competitive
            in pricing against the rest,' Sfakianakis said. 'That's the
            only way it can be done in a market that is price sensitive.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wells Fargo Joins JPMorgan to Raise $3.5 Billion After Earnings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), the most profitable U.S. banks, are selling a
            combined $3.5 billion of debt and preferred stock after
            generating record income in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo issued $1.15 billion of five-year debt that
            pays 63 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
            offered rate and an additional $850 million of its 1.5 percent
            securities due January 2018 that yield 75 basis points more than
            similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is planning to issue $1.5 billion of perpetual
            preferred stock to yield 5.15 percent, according to a person
            familiar with that transaction who asked not to be identified,
            citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo's 2018 securities traded at 100.5 cents on the
            dollar April 11 to yield 1.4 percent, or 67 basis points more
            than Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
            system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offerings follow first-quarter earnings that relied on
            cost cuts and smaller loan-loss reserves with lending less
            lucrative. JPMorgan's net income rose 33 percent to $6.53
            billion and Wells Fargo's profit climbed 22 percent to $5.17
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Relative borrowing costs have been declining, with the
            extra yield investors demand to own bank debt instead of
            industrial company obligations narrowing to 8 basis points
            yesterday, from 103 a year ago, according to Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Aids U.S. Agency With Market-Based Foreign Aid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign aid has long been one of
            the most unpalatable dishes on the federal plate. Why should
            U.S. taxpayers give billions of dollars to ungrateful countries
            that will waste it and whose people don't like America anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quietly, though, the U.S. Agency for International
            Development has been undergoing a market-oriented sea change
            that has attracted fans such as Amy Bell, an executive director
            of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), and hundreds of Wall Street veterans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're really showcasing the power of business to do
            well and do well in a prudent way,' said Bell, the head of
            principal investments for JPMorgan's Social Finance unit in New
            York, in a telephone interview. 'I think they've done a
            remarkable job.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government's global anti-poverty agency backs a
            private equity fund that Bell's JPMorgan unit runs for African
            agriculture businesses. It helped General Electric Co. (GE) secure
            $10 million in local financing for small maternal-health clinics
            in Kenya. It's supported loans by Root Capital, a social-investment fund, to help coffee farmers in Latin
            America supply
            Starbucks Inc. (SBUX) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's a sea change for an agency that for years simply gave
            out money. The program, called the Development Credit Authority,
            was begun in 1999 under President George W. Bush with authority
            from Congress to provide loan guarantees, but in the 10 years
            before 2011 it backed only $2.2 billion in credit. Since 2011,
            the authority has issued $1 billion in guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shrinking Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's still a fraction of the aid agency's effort. AID has
            seen its funding shrink from $22.5 billion in fiscal year 2010
            to $20.4 billion in fiscal 2014, not adjusted for inflation. The
            Obama administration has asked Congress for $20.1 billion in
            fiscal 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our developmental objectives -- ending extreme poverty in
            15 years, ending preventable child death, ending large-scale,
            widespread child hunger -- will only be achieved if we can
            effectively harness and deploy massive amounts of private
            investment against those goals,' said Rajiv Shah, the agency's
            administrator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Shah and Ben Hubbard, former director of the credit
            authority, arrived in January 2010, they saw an underutilized
            asset. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't look at these problems and say, 'How do we get
            the appropriations budget to solve this?'' Hubbard said in an
            interview. 'It's, 'How do I attract the private sector to get
            this done, because it's inherently more sustainable?' Rather
            than building and paying for solar power plants, we can attract
            private capital to pay for them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Former Bankers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency's credit authority, with a few dozen 'private
            sector, deal-oriented' former bankers and financial analysts,
            has brought tools from Wall Street to hone a model that Shah
            said he hopes will transform not only development work, but also
            the thinking in his agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the credit unit has leveraged private capital
            to help companies expand while assisting some of the world's
            most vulnerable people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The credit authority guaranteed an $8 million loan by New
            York-based JPMorgan to the African Agricultural Capital Fund,
            which helped attract equity investors and boost the Uganda-based
            fund to $25 million. The arrangement allowed the bank to
            experiment with a new market, lending to the small- and medium-sized businesses that are the engine of
            economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Republican Applause &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The private-sector approach has drawn applause from critics
            of foreign aid such as Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who's praised the credit
            agency's 'proven
            track record of significantly leveraging private financing in
            support of development aid,' even as she's called for cuts to
            other parts of the foreign aid budget. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The development credit agency works in a number of ways.
            Most often, it encourages banks in developing countries to loan
            to smaller businesses, usually in underserved sectors such as
            farming that align with U.S. development goals, by sharing the
            risk if there's a default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a lot of wealth in these banks, but they're risk-averse,' said Hubbard. 'We don't take out
            all the risk, so
            they have skin in the game, but we lower it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Nereus Capital LLC was struggling for funds, the
            credit authority partnered with U.S.-based institutional
            investors to help raise a $100 million investment in the Mumbai-based company's fund for clean-energy
            projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deploying Wealth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Learning how to deploy that wealth to tackle development
            challenges, environmental challenges in India, is how we will
            solve extreme poverty and its consequences of child hunger and
            child death there,' said Shah, 41, who earned a medical degree
            from the University of Pennsylvania and previously was chief
            scientist for the U.S. Agriculture Department and worked for the
            Bill Melinda Gates Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The credit authority's default rate has been 1.89 percent,
            with the aid agency paying out $11.6 million in claims since
            1999 and collecting $14.1 million in bank fees. It also provide
            credit enhancement to companies such as Cambridge,
            Massachusetts-based Root Capital, which identified a gap in
            financing for farmers' cooperatives that were too large for
            microcredit loans and too small for bank loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cooperatives use the funding to help small farmers
            improve their yields, reduce post-harvest losses -- enhancing
            food security -- and earn more by selling collectively to
            companies such as Seattle-based Starbucks, the world's largest
            operator of coffee shops. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Loan Guarantees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year, the president has asked Congress to raise the
            annual cap on the credit authority's loan guarantee program to
            $2 billion from $1.5 billion. It's an idea whose time had come,
            Hubbard said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, change is sometimes difficult, Shah acknowledges.
            The aid agency, created in 1961 by an executive order from
            President John F. Kennedy, has 9,421 people worldwide who are
            steeped in a culture of giving money away, not raising it. Now,
            Hubbard said, overseas missions are being held accountable to
            targets for attracting private capital to fund their programs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a huge amount of enthusiasm and excitement, and
            also resistance in any system to doing things in new and
            innovative ways,' Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One solution has been to recruit Wall Street veterans to
            the government aid agency, with almost 1,000 joining since the
            end of the Bush administration, Hubbard said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reasons for signing up vary, said Hubbard, who has left the
            agency to start a firm funding businesses in Africa. 'Some lost
            their jobs because of the financial crisis and found purpose in
            our mission,' he said. 'Others could command a bigger salary
            elsewhere, they just didn't have a lot of purpose and meaning in
            those positions.' As a group, he adds, they're 'very counter-cultural inside the agency.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cairo Reality Show &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These 'field investment officers' work across the
            agency's 'silos,' Hubbard said, bringing a financial viewpoint
            to help health or agricultural specialists figure out how to
            bring private capital into their programs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chris Lee, a former energy trader from Newtown,
            Connecticut, now works as a field investment officer in Cairo,
            where he's developed a loan program for small- and medium-sized
            businesses, helps run a local reality TV show about
            entrepreneurs, and is looking at ways to support business people
            in the informal economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's amazing how simple ideas can be effective,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Looks to Uber, Seamless to Plot Mobile Future</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) digital chief
            Gavin Michael, who joined the firm a year ago, has a certain
            disdain for some competitors' staid mobile-banking apps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While functional, the apps aren't intuitive or personalized
            enough. So when it came time for the New York-based company to
            update its app, with a new iPhone version available today,
            Michael, 49, said he studied software produced by technology
            startups. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'How do I make this simple, human, cohesive? How do we
            change the principles we're chasing?' he said in an April 15
            interview. 'We looked at what a lot of the startups are doing,
            whether it's Seamless and the way I order takeout food, or Uber
            and the way I catch a cab, or OpenTable and the way I book
            restaurant reservations, or the way Apple iOS is shaped.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders including JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets, are leaning on mobile and online offerings to win
            loyalty while lowering the cost of retail services. The firm's
            mobile users rose 24 percent from a year ago to 16.4 million.
            Bank of America Corp., the No. 2 U.S. lender, said mobile
            customers increased 19 percent to 15 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael, who reports to consumer-banking chief Gordon Smith, joined JPMorgan from consulting firm
            Accenture, where he
            was head of technology innovation. He has since hired executives
            from outside finance, including Tim Parsey, a former senior vice
            president of design at Yahoo! Inc. and Josh Klenert, a former
            designer for the Huffington Post. Both are based in San
            Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior versions of the bank's mobile app for the iPhone drew
            3 1/2 out of five stars on Apple Inc.'s App Store as of late
            yesterday. Bank of America's had a similar rating. Apps from San
            Francisco-based Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and New York-based Citigroup
            Inc. both had three stars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Greetings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's redesigned app for the iPhone has a simpler
            login and location-based greetings to give users a more
            personalized experience, Michael said. The background photo
            shown to a customer in New York may feature the Brooklyn Bridge,
            for example, while a client in San Francisco sees streetcars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People work on an emotional level before they go to the
            rational level,' Michael said. 'What we're trying to do with
            banking is create that emotional experience inside the way which
            images are used, the way we greet and the way we understand how
            customers bank with us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Future versions will probably detect users' location to
            tailor their experience and ease transactions including in-store
            purchases and pulling cash from automated teller machines, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cutting Branches &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When I'm near an ATM, how do I get the two to work so I
            can preload transactions?' Michael said. 'We want a cohesive
            experience across our digital and live interactions. So things
            should work together and feel like they belong together.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mobile technology has helped firms including Charlotte,
            North Carolina-based Bank of America reduce bank branches.
            Customers 'effectively carry a branch in their pocket,' Chief
            Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, 54, said yesterday on a
            conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, branches will remain a key fixture for lenders,
            Michael said. They are evolving into places where customers seek
            financial advice, while performing routine activities like
            depositing checks with mobile phones or ATMs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It changes the relationship you have with the branch, as
            opposed to replacing it,' Michael said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Raises $1.5 Billion Offering Fixed-, Floating-Rate Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, raised $1.5 billion in an offering of two-
            year fixed- and floating-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's $1.25 billion of floating-rate securities yield
            45 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
            offered rate and its $250 million of 0.8 percent debt yields 59
            basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds may be rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service,
            according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
            not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
            publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $1.65 billion of 3.4 percent notes due June 2015
            traded yesterday at 105.7 cents on the dollar to yield 0.77
            percent, or 54.2 basis points over Treasuries, according to
            Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry

        <headline>JPMorgan, Barclays Seen Topping OTC Commodity Derivatives Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Barclays
            Plc (BARC) were the top firms for providing over-the-counter commodity
            derivatives to companies hedging energy and metals exposure,
            while investors favored Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a Greenwich
            Associates survey found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays and JPMorgan, which tied for No. 1 position, had
            relationships with 39 percent of the global corporations
            surveyed about their OTC dealers to hedge energy exposure, ahead
            of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS), the survey found. JPMorgan
            also led in metals. Among investors, 59 percent said they had a
            relationship with Goldman Sachs, 54 percent named JPMorgan and
            47 percent used Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Banks are rethinking their approach to the commodities
            business in light of new capital requirements and regulations,'
            Andrew Awad, a consultant with Stamford, Connecticut-based
            researcher Greenwich Associates, said in a statement today.
            'The landscape is becoming far more fragmented, as few banks
            want to be all things to all people and more find specific
            segments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
            percent last year to $6 billion amid low volatility and client
            flows as Goldman ranked No. 1, followed by JPMorgan, according
            to a Feb. 15 report from analytics company Coalition. Increasing
            concerns about regulation and capital sensitivity also led banks
            to re-examine commodity strategies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fifty-five percent in the Greenwich survey said they used
            JPMorgan to hedge their metals exposure, while 34 percent used
            Barclays. Thirty-three percent named Citigroup and Deutsche Bank
            AG (DBK) and 26 percent said they hedged with Societe Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Ranking &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan led the ranks in energy because of its dominance
            in the U.S. and Asia, according to the survey. Barclays tied
            with Morgan Stanley for the top position in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculation about investors leaving commodities because of
            regulatory changes 'appears to be overblown,' according to
            Greenwich Associates. Investment managers will continue to use
            OTC markets for index business, while hedge funds are likely to
            move to futures over time as regulations are enforced, Awad
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
            declined to comment for this story. Greenwich Associates
            surveyed 276 corporations that hedge their energy exposure and
            98 that hedge metals, as well as 68 commodity investors that use
            OTC derivatives between September and November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan CMBS Deal With Sales at Post-Crisis Peak</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is marketing
            $500 million of commercial-mortgage bonds, capping what probably
            will be the busiest month in the $550 billion market in more
            than five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender plans to issue securities linked to 82
            properties spanning the U.S. from California to Kentucky,
            according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not
            to be identified because terms aren't public. Hotel loans
            account for 64.2 percent of the deal, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of bonds tied to commercial real estate in April
            is poised to surpass the $8.3 billion sold in January, which
            marked the highest monthly volume since December 2007, according
            to JPMorgan. Volume was $6.9 billion through April 19, the bank
            said. Investors are reversing course after pulling back amid the
            glut of offerings, debt analysts at New York-based JPMorgan said
            in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'After some weakness to start the month, pricing spreads
            have begun to snap back despite the uptick in supply,' the
            analysts led by Ed Reardon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc sold
            top-ranked securities maturing in about 10 years to yield 81
            basis points, or 0.81 percentage point, more than the benchmark
            swap rate on April 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            That compares with 85 basis points on similar debt issued by the
            lenders on March 6, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Risk Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for riskier portions of the deals is building. Wells
            Fargo and RBS sold bonds rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
            ranking, to pay a spread of 310 basis points more than swaps
            this month, compared with 375 basis points in March, people
            familiar with the transaction said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are buying the bonds as the Federal Reserve's
            effort to stimulate economic growth by suppressing borrowing
            costs pushes investors toward riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Insurance companies boosted purchases of lower-ranking
            commercial-mortgage debt this year by nine percentage points,
            accounting for 33 percent of subordinate debt purchases from new
            deals, the JPMorgan analysts said in a separate report on April
            12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of commercial-mortgage bonds is poised to climb 50
            percent to $70 billion in 2013, according to Credit Suisse Group
            AG. Banks have arranged about $28.6 billion in sales this year,
            Bloomberg data show. A record $232 billion was issued in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

            U.S. bank by assets, sold $2 billion of 10-year subordinated
            debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank issued the 3.375 percent notes due May 2023 to

            Moody's Investors Service, said a person familiar with the
            offering, who asked not to be identified because the terms
            weren't set at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering will be used for general
            corporate purposes, including debt repayment, investments in its
            units, redemption of securities or funding possible
            acquisitions, according to a company filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $750 million of 6.125 percent subordinated bonds

        <headline>Raymond James Beats JPMorgan as Best Brokerage: Riskless Return</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Raymond James Financial Inc., the
            brokerage that posted profits for 100 straight quarters, is
            showing investors that simplicity is key to generating gains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With headquarters 1,200 miles from Wall Street, the St.
            Petersburg, Florida-based company produced the best risk-
            adjusted return of nine U.S. brokerages, banks and advisory
            firms since 2009, the BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows.
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, ranked third as
            Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) were among the worst performers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors compare Raymond James, which has a business model
            that's easy to grasp and shields the balance sheet from risk, to
            an asset manager as it mainly relies on fees. Unlike larger
            rivals, the brokerage gets most of its sales managing investor
            money, earning 64 percent of annual revenue in the last fiscal
            year from its private-client group. That gave Raymond James the
            stability to weather a financial crisis that caused larger banks
            to write off billions of dollars in loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You threw everything but the kitchen sink at the
            financial-services industry and this company sailed through
            rather successfully,' said Dan Veru, chief investment officer
            at Palisade Capital Management LLC, which owns Raymond James
            shares and manages $3.8 billion. 'That largeness that used to
            be an advantage, I don't think it's such an advantage anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) won a contract
            to help manage about $12 billion in bonds for Resolution Life
            Holdings Inc., a startup insurer that plans to acquire policies
            from other U.S. carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The partnership represents a comprehensive investment
            management relationship that includes fixed-income portfolio
            management, asset-liability management and product hedging,'
            according to a statement today from Resolution. It will also
            cover 'asset-allocation strategy and investment accounting and
            reporting support.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Resolution said last month that it plans to initially
            invest $2 billion to build a "lasting, sizable and
            differentiated" insurance company in the U.S. comprised of
            businesses that are no longer adding new clients. The
            announcement followed its agreement to buy Lincoln Benefit Life
            from Allstate Corp. (ALL) in July. Insurers including Hartford
            Financial Services Group Inc. have been looking to sell U.S.
            life operations as low interest rates pinch profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Resolution Chairman Clive Cowdery pursued a similar
            strategy in the U.K., where he amassed a personal fortune
            consolidating the industry. Over the last decade, his Resolution
            Group bought 25 insurers, comprising more than 10 million
            policyholders and $200 billion in policy assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money managers including New York-based JPMorgan, BlackRock
            Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been vying to win
            contracts with insurance clients to boost fee income. Insurers
            have sought Wall Street investment expertise to diversify their
            portfolios and meet regulatory requirements. Outsourcing also
            allows the insurers to focus on underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said March 31 that its Highbridge Principal
            Strategies LLC will manage funds for Watford Re Ltd., a Bermuda-based reinsurer. &lt;/p&gt;

            structured notes tied to Hong Kong's largest property trust in
            more than 15 months, as rising rents in the city fuel gains in
            real estate investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank on April 3 sold HK$4.5 million ($580,000) of
            securities tied to The Link (823) Real Estate Investment Trust, Hong
            Kong's biggest REIT, and Wharf Holdings Ltd., the owner of the
            Times Square and Harbour City malls, according to an e-mail from
            the lender's staff handling structured products in the city. The
            product pays monthly coupons for days when the prices of the two
            underlying assets remain in certain ranges, according to the e-

            parking spaces, and Wharf (4) both rose to all-time highs this
            month. Average Hong Kong rents for prime shopping locations may
            rise 8 percent this year, according to property broker CBRE
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Polly Leung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on why the bank chose to link the notes to
            the property investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc had last issued notes tied to the Link
            REIT, along with other stocks, in December 2011, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Frank Bisignano, co-chief operating
            officer of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), is expected to leave as soon as
            this week, the New York Times reported, citing several people
            familiar with his decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisignano will become First Data Corp.'s chief executive,
            the newspaper said, citing the people familiar. A JPMorgan
            spokeswoman declined to comment to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The latest executive departure follows on the heels others
            who have left the bank, including Heidi Miller, James Staley,
            Bill Winters and Steve Black. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisignano had been promoted to co-COO in July along with

        <headline>LightSquared Plan to Benefit JPMorgan, Ergen Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;LightSquared Inc.'s plan to
            reorganize will improperly benefit lenders including JPMorgan
            Chase Co., which will own all of the wireless-spectrum
            company's assets after bankruptcy, Dish Network Corp. (DISH) Chairman
            Charles Ergen said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plan was devised in talks where LightSquared's
            controlling shareholder, Philip Falcone, 'made it clear that he
            was interested in using the plan to enrich himself and equity
            holders,' Ergen said yesterday in a bankruptcy court filing in
            Manhattan. Falcone stated that he wanted to protect three
            parties: his investment firm Harbinger Capital Partners LLC,
            Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) and JPMorgan, Ergen said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP Special Opportunities Inc., an Ergen fund that invested
            $1 billion in LightSquared debt, made the allegations following
            an eight-day trial on whether LightSquared can reorganize under
            a plan that puts Ergen's debt behind other lenders and equity
            holders to be repaid. In yesterday's filing, the fund dissected
            how much JPMorgan, Fortress, Harbinger and another investor,
            Melody Capital Advisors LLC, stand to benefit compared with what
            money they put at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Falcone made it clear in numerous e-mails that the
            primary purpose of the plan and its subordination or
            disallowance of SPSO's claims was to enrich Mr. Falcone and
            Harbinger,' Ergen said. Closing arguments in the trial are
            planned for May 5 and 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Falcone has said he had a fiduciary duty to advocate for
            Harbinger's investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Affiliate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) affiliate SIG Holdings Inc. currently holds all of
            LightSquared's series B preferred stock. The New York-based bank
            also has put $360 million into LightSquared through operating
            loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investments may be worth 'hundreds of millions of
            dollars,' and JPMorgan will own all of LightSquared's equity
            and assets after the bankruptcy, Ergen said. JPMorgan also may
            benefit from LightSquared tax-loss benefits estimated at more
            than $2 billion, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LightSquared, based in Reston, Virginia, sought court
            protection after the Federal Communications Commission blocked
            the company's wireless service, saying it might interfere with
            global-positioning-system navigation equipment. The company
            listed assets of $4.48 billion and debt of $2.29 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Washington
            Mutual Inc. and Citigroup Inc. (C) were sued by Integer Program LLC
            over $301 million in losses from mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;

            New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual securitized more than 4,600 residential
            mortgage loans that were eventually sold to Integer, according
            to the complaint. The alleged breaches occurred on more than
            1,400 loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over 60 mortgage loans were delinquent as of the
            applicable cut-off date and/or the date of the closing of the
            offering of the certificates to the public,' Integer said in a

        <headline>Mortgage Trustees Seek $4.5 Billion JPMorgan Accord Approval</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond trustees including U.S.
            Bank N.A. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. asked a New York
            state court judge to approve a $4.5 billion settlement with
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) over investor claims of faulty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan made an offer to the trustees in November to
            settle claims relating to the underwriting and servicing of
            loans in 330 residential mortgage securitization trusts, as well
            as claims over document delivery, according to a petition filed
            yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer was negotiated by New York-based JPMorgan and a
            group of 21 institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc.
            and Pacific Investment Management Co., that held more than $24
            billion, or 32 percent of the securities issued by the trusts,
            according to the petition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord is being declined by trustees for five of the
            trusts and part of another, according to a notice posted online
            last week. The lack of a more sweeping approval may leave the
            bank exposed to a larger payout. The deadline for accepting the
            proposed settlement has been pushed back several times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan negotiated the agreement in a bid to move past
            lawsuits tied in part to the housing crisis. The accord was
            announced the week before the largest U.S. bank agreed to a
            record $13 billion settlement with government agencies over
            faulty mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were central to
            the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the worst
            recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed and the
            market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In the matter of the application of U.S. Bank
            National Association, 652382/2014, New York State Supreme Court,

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys UBS's OTC Commodity Derivatives Portfolio</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which said last
            month it plans to get out of the business of owning and trading
            physical commodities from metals to oil, bought the over-the-counter commodity derivatives portfolio of UBS
            AG (UBSN), which is
            exiting most of its raw-materials trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction includes on-exchange hedge positions and
            excludes precious metals and index-based products, UBS said in
            an e-mailed statement today. JPMorgan assumed market risk on the
            portfolio and the two banks 'will work together in the coming
            months with their clients to fully assign contracts for
            individual trades to JPMorgan,' according to the statement.
            JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are scaling back or exiting their commodities
            operations amid regulatory scrutiny and lower profits from raw
            materials. Revenue in commodities at the 10 largest investment
            banks fell 25 percent in the first half of the year, analytics
            company Coalition said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last month that it's considering an exit from
            the business of trading physical commodities, marking a reversal
            of its push into raw materials with its 2010 purchase of parts
            of RBS Sempra, a joint venture between Royal Bank of Scotland
            Group Plc and Sempra Energy. (SRE) UBS and JPMorgan didn't report the
            price of the transaction reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zurich-based UBS, Switzerland's biggest lender, last year
            decided to close its oil, base metals and agriculture trading
            desks, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said Oct.
            31. The bank is keeping its index-investor products and precious
            metals trading. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Wins Dismissal of Los Angeles Bias Lending Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. won dismissal of
            claims by Los Angeles accusing the bank's Washington Mutual unit
            of targeting minority borrowers with predatory loans, while a
            judge said the allegations could be refiled against the parent
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles ruled that
            while claims related to Washington Mutual Inc. were barred, the
            city could revise the lawsuit to focus on Chase's lending
            practices during and after JPMorgan bought WaMu in 2008. The
            city lumped Chase and WaMu loan information together in the
            original complaint and has 21 days to refile the lawsuit
            focusing on non-WaMu loans, Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of at least four filed by Los Angeles
            against banks for allegedly flooding minority neighborhoods with
            subprime mortgages even when residents qualified for better
            terms. The city alleged the subprime loans drove up the number
            of foreclosures in the city. Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) lost a court bid
            in May to dismiss a similar case brought by Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Los Angeles and other cities have explored legal means to
            hold banks accountable for urban blight in the wake of the 2008
            collapse of the U.S. housing market and financial crisis.
            Homeowners in Los Angeles lost about $78.8 billion in home value
            as the result of 200,000 foreclosures from 2008 through 2012,
            the city said last year, citing a report by Alliance of
            Californians for Community Empowerment and the California
            Reinvestment Coalition. The lost property tax revenue to the
            city has been $481 million, according to the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased with this decision, and we will continue
            to carry out our strong commitment to Los Angeles residents,'
            Suzanne Ryan, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, said in
            an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Attorney
            Michael Feuer, said the city is weighing whether to appeal the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the meantime we are aggressively pursuing our claims
            against JPMorgan Chase,' he said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is City of Los Angeles v. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM),
            14-cv-04168, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
            (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Fund Choices for Clients Said Under SEC Review</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
            Commission is reviewing whether conflicts of interest led
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to sell certain investment products to
            individual clients, according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The review is at an early stage, said the person, who asked
            to remain anonymous because the inquiry isn't public. The Wall
            Street Journal, in a report on the review earlier today, said
            the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has conducted a
            similar probe into whether JPMorgan inappropriately steered
            private-banking clients into its own products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks can capture a greater portion of fees by having
            clients invest in their own products. In some cases, they can
            also offer better-than-average performance. New York-based
            JPMorgan said in February that 80 percent of its fixed-income
            assets under management and 81 percent of its equity assets were
            in funds that were in the top 40 percent of peers over the
            previous 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We manage a variety of portfolios based on a client's
            investment objectives, and the mix of solutions varies, is
            dynamic and transparent,' said Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan
            spokesman. 'Our clients have countless options in selecting
            financial providers. They come to JPMorgan because of our long-term investments track record and the depth
            and breadth of our
            platform.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the SEC, couldn't be
            immediately reached for comment. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC
            spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Unit Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private banking, which caters to wealthy individual
            clients, generated more than half of JPMorgan's $5.73 billion in
            asset-management revenue in the first six months of this year.
            The unit accounted for $383 billion in assets under management,
            or 22 percent of the division's $1.7 trillion total. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's asset-management business, led by Mary Callahan Erdoes, generated $993 million of net
            income in the first half
            of 2014, the lowest among the largest U.S. bank's four major
            divisions. The unit's 22 percent return on equity was the
            highest of the four. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan set aside $669 million for legal expenses in the
            second quarter. The lender agreed to pay $23 billion in
            penalties and settlements last year, leading to its first
            quarterly loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

            developments at the World Trade Center or Hudson Yards, are in early stages and no decision is imminent,
            said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. JPMorgan has moved
            back-office jobs to New Jersey, Delaware and Florida to cut expenses, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks,
            under pressure to boost returns, have been seeking lower-cost locations for employees who don't interact
            directly with clients. JPMorgan is examining its property holdings in New York, where it had 11.4 million
            square feet (1.1 million square meters) at the end of 2013, including 1.3 million at its 270 Park Ave.
            headquarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold its 60-story skyscraper at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza last year
            to Shanghai-based Fosun International Ltd., and began moving 2,000 employees to offices in Brooklyn's
            MetroTech Center this year. JPMorgan owns the Park Avenue building as well as the former headquarters of
            Bear Stearns Cos. at 383 Madison Ave., which it acquired in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Sell 50% of Buyout Portfolio to Two Buyers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which last
            year said its private-equity unit would become independent,
            agreed to sell half of its $4.5 billion in buyout holdings to
            Carlyle Group LP (CG)'s AlpInvest Partners BV and Lexington Partners
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dealmakers at One Equity Partners LLC will form OEP Capital
            Advisors LP, an investment firm independent from New York-based
            JPMorgan, when the transaction is completed, which is expected
            by year-end, according to a statement today. OEP will manage the
            rest of the portfolio, JPMorgan said. Financial terms of the
            agreement weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms are unloading parts of their businesses
            as regulations require that they bolster capital and reduce
            investments made with their own money. JPMorgan, whose Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in December he's 'pruning'
            divisions the bank doesn't need, last month agreed to sell about
            $1.3 billion of loans and securities to Bain Capital LLC's
            Sankaty Advisors LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale of One Equity Partners' holdings isn't expected to
            have a material impact on JPMorgan's earnings, the company said
            in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lexington, based in New York, raised $7 billion in 2011 for
            a fund to buy stakes in buyout funds, a practice known as
            secondary private-equity investing. AlpInvest, a Dutch manager
            of funds-of-funds and secondary stakes with $52 billion in
            assets under management, is a unit of Washington-based Carlyle,
            the second-largest manager of investment alternatives to stocks
            and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused of Self-Dealing in Managing Church Trust</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was sued for
            fraud, self-dealing and mismanagement of trust accounts
            established for an Indianapolis church endowed by the
            descendants of drug company founder Eli Lilly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Christ Church Cathedral sued JPMorgan today in
            Indianapolis federal court, claiming it selected unsuitable and
            poorly-performing investments to further its own financial
            interests. The Episcopal church founded in 1837 accused the
            world's fourth-biggest bank by asset value of breaching state
            and federal securities laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank 'caused the church trusts to lose approximately
            $13 million in value as a result of JPMorgan's decisions to
            purchase over 177 different investment products, mostly from
            itself, using church funds,' between July 2004 and December
            2013, the plaintiffs said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The congregation seeks unspecified compensatory and
            punitive damages. The lawsuit comes five days after a Bloomberg
            News report that the Securities and Exchange Commission is
            reviewing whether conflicts of interest led JPMorgan to sell
            certain investment products to individual clients, according to
            a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Guided Architecture &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks can capture a greater portion of fees by having
            clients invest in their own products. The Christ Church
            Cathedral alleged JPMorgan employed a 'guided architecture'
            platform through which it selected products based on their
            profitability to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
            bank, declined to comment on the church lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan put between 68 percent and 85 percent of the
            church's assets into its own products, including private equity
            funds, structured notes and hedge funds, according to the
            complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Christ Church claims JPMorgan made more money on some of
            the financial products it bought for the church, even as the
            trusts bore all of the risk. During one seven-year stretch
            ending in 2013, according to the complaint, the trusts, which
            were worth as much as $39.2 million, declined to $31.6 million,
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time, JPMorgan's holdings increased by $1.4
            trillion and its net revenue more than doubled, the church
            claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Rector, Wardens and Vestrymen of the Christ
            Church Cathedral of Indianapolis v. JPMorgan Chase Co., 14-cv-01331, U.S. District Court, Southern District

        <headline>CRH, Eren Said to Hire JPMorgan to Sell Turkey Cement Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;CRH Plc (CRH), Ireland's biggest cement
            company, and its Turkish partner Eren Holding AS have hired
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to help sell their cement joint venture in
            Turkey, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies including Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL), Limak
            Holding AS and Oyak Cement Group are interested in the unit, in
            which CRH holds a 50 percent stake with Istanbul-based Eren
            owning the rest, said the people, who asked not to be named
            because the talks are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The three potential bidders are among those shortlisted and
            the sale process for the unit, known as Denizli Cimento Sanayii
            TAS, could be finalized by October, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 20 domestic and international cement producers,
            including Italcementi SpA (IT), operate in Turkey, where cement
            makers have a total annual capacity of about 107 million tons,
            according to the local Cement Producers' Association. The
            country, which has a gross domestic product of about $820
            billion, is seeking to become one of the largest 10 economies in
            the world by 2023, and has planned $100 billion of
            infrastructure projects in the next four years, including a new
            bridge across the Bosphorus strait. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives of Sabanci Holding and Eren Holding didn't
            respond to e-mailed questions and calls seeking comment.
            Representatives of CRH, JPMorgan, Oyak, Denizli and Limak
            Holding declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Denizli Output &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denizli, in which CRH bought a 50 percent stake from Eren
            Holding in 2007, produces about 3 percent of Turkey's and 31
            percent of western Turkey's total clinker output, according to
            its website. The company is aiming to increase its sales to 250
            million liras ($116 million) this year from 220 million liras in
            2013, according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oyak Group's cement units include Mardin Cimento Sanayii
            Ticaret AS, Unye Cimento Sanayii Ticaret AS, Bolu Cimento
            Sanayii AS and Aslan Cimento AS, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sabanci's Cimsa Cimento agreed to buy Sancim Bilecik
            Cimento, a cement producer in western Turkey, from Sonmez Group
            for $220.7 million, it said in a public filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Have Led Record Buying of India Bonds Yesterday</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. bought about
            $2.4 billion of Indian government bonds yesterday, leading
            record purchases by international banks, according to three
            fixed-income dealers in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign lenders acquired a net 148 billion rupees ($2.4
            billion) of sovereign debt yesterday, the most in Clearing Corp.
            of India Ltd. data going back to 2006. JPMorgan may have
            purchased the notes on behalf of institutional clients, the
            dealers said, asking not to be identified as the information
            isn't public. Mollica Senapati, a spokeswoman in Mumbai for the
            U.S. bank, declined to comment on the matter in an e-mailed
            response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global funds pumped in an unprecedented $13.8 billion into
            local government and corporate bonds in 2014 as India's success
            in reining in inflation and stabilizing the rupee added to
            optimism the nation's new government will spur economic growth.
            JPMorgan's purchases made up about 90 percent of the $2.76
            billion pumped in by overseas money managers yesterday, exchange
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The purchases represent a significant amount for the bond
            markets,' said Anindya Das Gupta, Mumbai-based treasurer at
            Barclays Plc. 'A stable currency, easing inflation and the
            fiscal intent of the government are helping to boost the global
            appetite for Indian bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 8.4 percent sovereign securities
            due July 2024 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
            point, yesterday to 8.48 percent, the lowest level this month.
            That's the biggest decline in a week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rupee, Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee has rebounded 13 percent from a record low of
            68.845 per dollar reached a year ago, the world's best-performing currency in the period, according to data
            compiled by
            Bloomberg. Consumer-price inflation in India slowed to 7.96
            percent in July from as much as 11.2 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Arun Jaitley aims to reduce the budget
            deficit to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product, which would be
            the least since 2008, in the year through March 2015, according
            to official estimates released last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's bond purchases were executed across different
            maturities in the afternoon trading session, the dealers said.
            All other categories of investors, including public and private
            banks, mutual funds and primary dealers, were net sellers of the
            securities yesterday, the Clearing Corp. data show. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Nigeria's 10-year bonds will be
            added to the JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) benchmark emerging-market
            index series, the nation's debt management agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The debt due 2024 will become part of the gauge by Aug. 29,
            Patience Oniha, executive director in charge of market
            development at the Debt Management Office, said by phone from
            the capital, Abuja. The inclusion reaffirms the strength of the
            Nigerian bond market, she said &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan added the West African nation's bonds due 2014,
            2019 and 2022 to its emerging-market index series in 2012,
            predicting the inclusion may lure $1.5 billion of portfolio
            investments to Africa's biggest oil producer. Barclays added
            some of the country's debts to its index last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan will want to add more Nigerian bonds in the
            future as old ones on their portfolio drop in tenor and there is
            need to review and add longer-tenor bonds that will reflect true
            pricing,' Kunle Ezun, a fixed-income securities and currency
            analyst at Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) in Lagos, said by phone.
            'The addition will give the Nigerian bond market a global
            outlook, increase investor demand and drop yields.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Nigerian bonds due March 2024 fell 1.8 percent
            to 12 percent yesterday, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>FBI Examining Whether Russia Is Tied to JPMorgan Hacking</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russian hackers attacked the U.S. financial system in mid-August, infiltrating and stealing data
            from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and at least one other bank, an incident the FBI is investigating as a
            possible retaliation for government-sponsored sanctions, according to two people familiar with the probe.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The attack resulted in the loss of gigabytes of sensitive data, said the people, who
            asked not to be identified because the probe is still preliminary. Authorities are investigating whether
            recent infiltrations of major European banks using a similar vulnerability are also linked to the attack,
            one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            Heartbleed Hack Still a Threat Six Months After Discovery
            &lt;p&gt;In one case, the hackers used a software flaw known as a zero-day vulnerability in one of the
            banks' websites. They then plowed through layers of elaborate security to steal the data, a feat security
            experts said appeared far beyond the capability of ordinary criminal hackers. The incidents occurred at a
            low point in relations between Russia and the West. Russian troops continue to mass on the Ukrainian border
            and the West tightens sanctions aimed at crippling Russian companies, including some of the country's most
            important banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Government Link &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sophistication of the attack
            and technical indicators extracted from the banks' computers provide some evidence of a government link.
            Still, the trail is muddy enough that investigators are considering the possibility that it's cyber
            criminals from Russia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Other federal agencies, including the National
            Security Agency, are now aiding the investigation, a third person familiar with the probe said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Computer hackers targeted JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and at least four other banks in a coordinated
            attack on major financial institutions this month, according to a U.S. official. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            attack led to the theft of customer data that could be used to drain accounts, according to another person
            briefed by U.S. law enforcement. The two people, who asked not to be identified because the investigation is
            continuing, discussed the incident after Bloomberg News reported a breach on banks earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hackers targeted customer and employee information, said a third person involved in the
            investigation, who was also briefed by the government. The theft involved gigabytes of data, said several
            people familiar with the attacks. The scale indicates a potential for significant financial fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most thefts of financial information involve retailers or personal computers of consumers. Stealing
            data from big banks is rare, because they have elaborate firewalls and security systems. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:

            JPMorgan Boosts Customer Data Protections After Attack
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg report said the FBI is investigating whether Russian hackers attacked JPMorgan and at
            least one other bank in retaliation for sanctions on the country over its involvement in the Ukraine
            military conflict. New York-based JPMorgan declined to comment on whether it was a victim of hacking, while
            saying the bank has multiple layers of defense to fend off data thefts. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said it increased defenses against computer hackers
            after an attack against the industry this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender is working with U.S.
            authorities to determine the scope of the assault and is taking additional steps to safeguard confidential
            information, Patricia Wexler, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said today in an e-mail, declining
            to give specific examples. JPMorgan will contact any customers that might have been affected, Wexler said,
            adding that the firm hasn't seen unusual fraud levels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            Russian Hackers Said to Loot Gigabytes of Big Bank Data
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was among at least five banks targeted in the coordinated attack on financial institutions
            in recent weeks, a U.S. official said yesterday. The assault led to the theft of customer data that could be
            used to drain accounts, according to another person briefed by U.S. law enforcement. Both asked not to be
            identified because U.S. probes are continuing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58,
            has warned shareholders in annual letters that hackers' efforts to breach the bank's computers were growing
            more frequent, sophisticated and dangerous. The firm expected to boost yearly spending on cybersecurity to
            about $250 million by the end of 2014, with 1,000 workers dedicated to the effort, he wrote in April. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's $380 Billion Man Won't Let Bubble Get Him Down</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;All those bond investors fretting
            about a bubble will probably be right eventually. In the
            meantime, they may want to think about buying some junk debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's how Bob Michele, who oversees $380 billion as
            JPMorgan Asset Management's chief investment officer for fixed
            income, is approaching the market. Just because yields on
            speculative-grade debt are falling toward the lowest ever,
            that's not a good enough reason to avoid it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ultimately there will be a bubble,' Michele said in a
            Bloomberg Television interview on Aug. 26. As for now, he said,
            'there's only so long that you're going to sit in cash earning
            a zero percent return in the U.S., perhaps a negative yield in
            Europe, before you go back into some form of bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michele isn't alone in seeing value in junk bonds despite
            Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's suggestion that the market
            has gotten frothy. While high-yield notes in the U.S. posted a
            1.3 percent loss last month, their first in almost a year,
            they've bounced right back with a 1.5 percent gain in August,
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reason yields are so low is because of the Fed's easy
            money policies, which are ongoing (even if a little scaled
            back). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So why leave now when the party's still good? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Not Much Upside &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's understandable why investors would be wary of plunging
            into less-creditworthy debt right now. Junk-rated bonds are
            yielding 5.9 percent as measured by Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch index data. That's about 0.2 percentage point from the
            all-time low, meaning potential returns are significantly less
            than the historic average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While mutual-fund investors yanked a record $7.1 billion
            from the debt in the week ended Aug. 6, they've since had a
            change of heart, plowing $2.9 billion back into the funds in the
            two weeks since, according to data provider Lipper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody has been lulled into this comforting notion
            that between a Goldilocks economy, not lifting off but not
            collapsing, and the Fed being the market's best friend, it's OK
            to leverage every risk factor,' Mohamed El-Erian, former chief
            executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. and
            Bloomberg View columnist, said in an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody's in the same trade,' he said. 'If sentiment
            changes, there's no shock absorber in the system.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Call it a game of chicken, where investors wait as long as
            they can before slipping out just before everybody else runs for
            the exits. Or perhaps another case of don't fight the Fed, which
            has pledged to keep benchmark rates low for a prolonged period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Typically you see bubbles at the end of Fed tightening,
            when the Fed has withdrawn liquidity from the system,' Michele
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's not happening yet. So for now, game on. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Snub Euribor Deal as EU Readies Bank Fines</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. and two other banks rejected a European Union deal to end an antitrust probe
            into the rigging of Euribor lending rates, risking higher fines and challenging the future of the EU's
            settlement process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The EU is seeking to announce two sets of settlements as soon as
            today with banks accused of colluding to rig the London interbank offered rate and Euribor, according to a
            person familiar with the EU's probe who asked not to be identified because the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While global fines for rate-rigging have already topped $3.7 billion, the cost to banks may climb
            as they face lawsuits worldwide. An EU accord includes a finding of liability that can be used in civil
            cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan joined HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Agricole SA in pulling out of the
            Euribor settlement talks, according to the person. ICAP Plc won't take part in the Libor settlement process,
            which relates to the yen, the Financial Times reported yesterday, without saying where it got the
            information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rejecting a settlement and facing a higher fine could be worth the risk,
            said Noelle Lenoir, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis Frankel LLP in Paris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies
            'know full well that admitting to what they are charged with would be a money pit,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            While JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, decided to pull out of the Euribor deal, the U.S. bank is
            part of the yen-Libor settlement, according to a person familiar with the probe. The set of evidence is
            different in both cases, said the person. Close

        <headline>JPMorgan's Largest Note Since 2010 Tied to Own Futures Index</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $234.7
            million of structured notes tied to a proprietary gauge of seven
            futures indexes, its largest U.S. offering in at least four
            years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five-year securities, issued Nov. 22, yield the gains
            and losses of the JPMorgan Enhanced Beta Select Backwardation
            Alternative Benchmark Total Return Index, according to a
            prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission. The gauge consists of seven other indexes tied to
            prices of commodities futures from gold to lean hogs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index rebalances monthly, based on weightings of its
            members in the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, the most popular
            commodity benchmark for structured notes this year, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Its level rises and falls with
            market prices and its members can change weekly to favor
            commodities showing the most 'backwardation,' where earlier
            contracts cost more than later deliveries, according to the
            prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A backwardated market is by no means indicative of prices
            falling into the future,' said Stephen Schork, president of the
            Schork Group Inc., a consultant to the energy industry in
            Villanova, Pennsylvania. 'The fact that prices are lower in the
            future isn't an indication that demand is going to fall in the
            future. It's just an indication that demand in the spot market
            is very strong.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index was established Sept. 30, less than two months
            before the securities were sold, according to the prospectus.
            Since then, it fell 0.4 percent to 101.93 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investor Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank charges 0.85 percent a year in investor fees, so
            the index would have to rise from its starting level at least
            4.25 percent at maturity for the notes to break even. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Backwardation can provide investors with a so-called roll
            yield from buying the earlier monthly contract and then
            collecting the difference as they sell and transfer into the
            next, cheaper month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank in New York,
            declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
            values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asks Judge to Keep Draft U.S. Fraud Suit Secret</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) had a hearing
            behind closed doors with a Pennsylvania judge in its bid to keep
            secret a draft of a government lawsuit related to its $13
            billion settlement with the U.S. as well as the identity of an
            employee who cooperated in a federal probe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is fighting an Oct. 17 order by Judge Stanton
            Wettick in Pittsburgh that it release the document and the
            employee's name to lawyers for the Federal Home Loan Bank of
            Pittsburgh, who say the material may provide a more detailed
            account of the U.S. Justice Department probe of JPMorgan that
            could be used in their lawsuit against the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'FHLB has not set forth any facts supporting why it needs
            the draft DOJ complaint or what admissible evidence it might
            glean from the allegations of a complaint,' Deborah Little, a
            lawyer for JPMorgan, said in a court filing. 'FHLB has not
            demonstrated any nexus between the DOJ's investigation and the
            subject matter of this case.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to the start of a hearing today, Wettick closed the
            courtroom to the public. Lawyers on both sides declined to
            comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FHLB lost $2.3 billion on mortgage-backed securities it
            purchased from JPMorgan. The losses aren't covered by the record
            U.S. settlement resolving allegations that the bank misled
            buyers about the soundness and risks of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is paying the
            record settlement to resolve Justice Department probes into the
            bank's sale of mortgage bonds that officials said helped feed
            the financial chaos of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FHLB's Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The conduct and deals at issue in the settlement are the
            same ones at the heart of the FHLB's case, David Beehler, an
            attorney for the Pittsburgh bank, said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acknowledged the settlement's statement of facts
            without admitting violations of law, Chief Financial Officer
            Marianne Lake said on a Nov. 19 conference call. In the
            statement, the official narrative of events leading to the
            infractions, the bank acknowledged that from 2005 to 2007 its
            subsidiaries securitized subprime and Alt-A mortgages loans and
            sold the resulting mortgaged-backed securities to investors
            while failing to disclose that the loans didn't meet
            underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The statement doesn't refer to specific employees,
            documents or events. It also doesn't provide any details about
            the loan programs or vendors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh bank is suing JPMorgan and credit rating
            companies including Moody's Investors Service over mortgage-backed securities it bought in 2006 and 2007.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Draft Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FHLB attorneys persuaded Wettick in October to order
            JPMorgan to turn over the draft civil fraud complaint prepared
            by U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento, California. The
            lawsuit alleged violations of the Financial Institution Reform,
            Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, known as FIRREA, according
            to court filings in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The law allows the government to sue an individual or
            group, rather than charge them with a crime, for fraud that
            affects a federally insured financial institution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FHLB agreed to give the bank until Nov. 22 to provide the
            document at the request of Justice Department lawyers who said
            the agency was close to a settlement, according to court
            filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord was announced Nov. 19, and three days later
            JPMorgan attorneys notified the FHLB that it would seek to block
            Wettick's order, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fraudulent Conduct' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given JPMorgan's apparent deep desire to prevent it from
            ever seeing the light of day, it would not be at all surprising
            if the draft complaint is a much more detailed account of
            JPMorgan's fraudulent conduct, and as such, far more
            enlightening than the statement of facts,' according to the
            filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the draft complaint was provided to it by the
            Justice Department as a 'confidential settlement
            communication' and it agreed to use it solely for the purpose
            of settlement negotiations, according to a court filing.
            Allowing the document to be turned over to the FHLB would
            violate state and federal law and 'chill the use of such
            materials in future settlement negotiations,' JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Moody's Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its case against Moody's, the Pittsburgh bank is seeking
            to question Jerome Fons, a former executive of the ratings
            company who criticized credit graders to U.S. lawmakers in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the FHLB have asked Wettick to allow them to
            question Fons on his testimony in a case against Morgan Stanley (MS)
            and other banks in federal court in Manhattan. That testimony,
            under seal after the case was voluntarily dismissed, was given
            to plaintiff lawyers in Pittsburgh. Moody's argued in court
            papers filed Nov. 20 that a deposition of Fons would 'provide
            no evidence relevant to this action and will only place undue
            burden on Moody's.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fons 'has no firsthand knowledge of any Moody's structured
            finance analyst ever allowing market share pressure to impact a
            particular rating,' lawyers for Moody's said, citing sections
            of the sealed testimony transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;House Committee &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fons told the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform
            Committee in October 2008 that originators of structured
            securities typically chose the agency with the lowest standards,
            'engendering a race to the bottom in terms of rating quality.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs allege Moody's and other rating companies
            assigned the highest possible ratings to mortgage-loan pools so
            they could be sold to institutional investors all the while
            knowing the certificates were actually junk bonds, according to
            court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fons, formerly a Moody's managing director for credit, left
            the firm in August 2007. Until his departure, he helped set
            criteria for how the firm rated the debt of corporations,
            financial institutions and countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The truth is that the rating agencies did not have
            sufficient and reliable information to place a triple-A rating
            on the securities,' the Pittsburgh bank said in court papers.
            'The rating agencies and other defendants knew they were
            feeding false information into their predictive models and that
            those models could not predict the losses on the loans in the
            mortgage pools.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh v. J.P.
            Morgan Securities LLC, GD09-016892, Court of Common Pleas of
            Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fidelity National Hires JPMorgan to Weigh Sale of Assets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity National Financial Inc. (FNF),
            the title insurer that also has restaurant businesses and an
            auto-parts company, hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to review
            possible divestitures of assets as the firm narrows its focus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer will consider spinoffs and sales of portfolio
            company investments, Jacksonville, Florida-based Fidelity
            National said today in a statement. The company holds stakes in
            vehicle-component maker Remy International Inc. (REMY), human-resources
            firm Ceridian Corp. and American Blue Ribbon Holdings LLC, the
            operator of restaurants including O'Charley's, Max Erma's,
            Village Inn and Bakers Square. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chairman William Foley is increasing his focus on the
            housing market after agreeing in May to buy Lender Processing
            Services Inc. (LPS), a former unit, for about $2.9 billion. The deal,
            which hasn't yet been completed, will help Foley expand in the
            business of providing and analyzing mortgage data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our energies are focused on the pending acquisition,'
            Foley said in the statement. 'Portfolio company investments
            have significant value which may not be fully reflected in our
            stock price'and we believe there are attractive alternatives we
            can pursue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity National, the largest U.S. title insurer, advanced
            2.7 percent to $30.34 at the close in New York. The company
            gained 25 percent this year through yesterday, trailing the 28
            percent rally in the Standard Poor's Midcap 400 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Shoppers are loading up on Internet
            coupons heading into the holidays -- and investors will soon get
            their chance to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebates Shopping.com Inc., which offers online coupons and
            discounts to consumers, picked JPMorgan Chase Co. to lead its
            initial public offering next year with help from Bank of America
            Corp., according to people with knowledge of the deal, who asked
            not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Online shopping jumped about 20 percent to a record on
            Cyber Monday last week, as consumers surfed the Web for post-Thanksgiving deals in lieu of hitting physical
            stores. More than
            100 million adults in the U.S. will use digital coupons next
            year, up from 96.6 million in 2013, according to researcher
            EMarketer Inc. That spurred online couponer RetailMeNot Inc. to
            go public earlier this year and is generating growth at Ebates
            and rival Coupons.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advertising and consumer-related companies are lining up to
            go public after Twitter Inc. (TWTR)'s offering last month and the rally
            that followed. TubeMogul Inc., a maker of software for digital
            marketing, and The Rubicon Project Inc., an online ad company,
            have picked banks for IPOs, as has Internet-dating site Zoosk
            Inc., people familiar with the companies have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebates was founded in 1998. The San Francisco-based company
            offers discounts to more than 1,600 online stores, including
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Macy's Inc. and Home Depot Inc. Members get
            paid back a percentage of every purchase they make each quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives from Ebates, JPMorgan and Bank of America
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebates is backed by investors including August Capital,
            Canaan Partners and Foundation Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RetailMeNot, based in Austin, Texas, has climbed 28 percent
            since its IPO in July and is valued at about $1.36 billion. The
            company and its shareholders filed earlier this week to sell an
            additional 6.27 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Says Banks to Reprice Products</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon said banks will have to charge more for
            lending to get a 'fair return' as regulators require the
            industry to set aside more funds to cushion against losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think that you're going to have all these banks
            around the world holding this amount of capital and the
            revolvers will cost the same,' Dimon, 57, said today at an
            investor conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New
            York. Revolving loans and repurchase agreements are among
            products that 'use a lot of balance sheet' and will have to be
            repriced, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are forcing firms to hold more capital
            against assets banks consider low risk by proposing a minimum
            leverage ratio of 5 percent as an increased buffer against
            potential losses. Market participants have said that would
            affect pricing and access to lending in the repurchase
            agreement, or repo, market, in which borrowers sell lenders
            securities with an agreement to buy them back later. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms face new curbs, including limits on
            hedging, designed to prevent financial blowups after the Federal
            Reserve and four other regulators yesterday adopted the Volcker
            rule, a centerpiece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The hedging
            provision drew more attention in the Volcker rule debate after
            JPMorgan lost $6.2 billion last year in bets on credit
            derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan May Pay $2 Billion to Resolve Madoff Probe, NYT Reports</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) may pay about
            $2 billion to resolve U.S. probes into whether the bank ignored
            signs of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the New York Times
            reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm is close to a deal that includes a deferred
            prosecution agreement and more than $1 billion in penalties to
            resolve a criminal case, with remaining sanctions imposed by
            federal regulators investigating gaps in the company's money-laundering safeguards, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in October that the company was in
            settlement talks that may lead to a deferred prosecution
            agreement. In such deals, the government agrees not to prosecute
            for a specified period and dismisses charges if the entity
            improves its programs or complies with the law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
            resolve government probes that have beset JPMorgan, while
            overhauling internal controls to improve relations with
            regulators. It's among Wall Street firms that have spent years
            fighting off claims brought on behalf of Madoff's victims,
            including accusations that the companies ignored the con man's
            fraud to continue reaping fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has been
            investigating how New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank
            by assets, handled funds controlled by Madoff and whether the
            firm turned a blind eye to his multibillion-dollar fraud, the
            biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
            comment on the settlement talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank listed at least eight Justice Department probes in
            a quarterly filing last month, ranging from the Madoff inquiry
            to investigations of hirings in Asia and its energy-trading
            practices. Weeks later, the firm agreed to a record $13 billion
            settlement to end government investigations of its mortgage-bond
            sales. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the target of
            multiple U.S. Justice Department investigations, tentatively
            agreed to pay about $2 billion to resolve probes into whether it
            ignored warning signs about Bernard Madoff's crimes, according
            to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also assented to a deferred-prosecution agreement,
            said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            negotiations are private. In such deals, the government agrees
            not to prosecute for a specified period and charges are
            dismissed if the entity improves its programs and complies with
            the law. The talks are in their final stages and the accord
            could be announced before year-end, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
            resolve government probes that have beset JPMorgan, the biggest
            U.S. bank, while overhauling internal controls to improve
            relations with regulators. Wall Street firms have spent years
            fighting off claims brought on behalf of Madoff's victims,
            including accusations that the companies ignored the con man's
            fraud to continue reaping fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the bank's
            primary regulator, and Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
            have been investigating how New York-based JPMorgan handled
            funds controlled by Madoff, whose multibillion-dollar fraud was
            the biggest Ponzi scheme in the nation's history. James Margolin, a Bharara spokesman, and the FBI's Peter
            Donald
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Additional Fines &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OCC, which sanctioned the lender in January for
            violating the Bank Secrecy Act, plans to punish the company for
            BSA violations related to Madoff, according to another person
            briefed on the probe. The OCC also is likely to fine the bank
            for additional anti-money laundering violations, the person
            said. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1970 Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions
            to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money
            laundering, such as reporting cash transactions exceeding
            $10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in October that a deferred-prosecution agreement was among options the U.S.
            had discussed
            with the bank. The New York Times reported on the tentative $2
            billion accord late yesterday. About half of the penalties will
            go toward resolving the Justice Department's criminal case while
            the rest will be paid to federal bank regulators, the newspaper
            said, citing people briefed on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earlier Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan listed at least eight Justice Department probes in
            a quarterly filing last month, including the Madoff inquiry, and
            investigations into hirings in Asia and the bank's energy-trading practices. Weeks later, the firm agreed to
            a record $13
            billion settlement to end government investigations of its
            mortgage-bond sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan enters a deferred-prosecution agreement in the
            Madoff case, it would be the second time that Attorney General
            Eric Holder has allowed Dimon's bank to avoid prosecution for
            behavior the government has deemed criminal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first was in 2011, when the department granted JPMorgan
            a non-prosecution agreement for its dealings in the municipal
            bond markets. The bank's employees 'entered into unlawful
            agreements to manipulate the bidding process and rig bids on
            municipal investment and related contracts' from 2001 through
            2006, the Justice Department said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Criminal Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In that case, the bank agreed to pay $228 million to
            federal and state agencies and to cooperate in the ongoing
            probe. The investigation resulted in criminal charges against 18
            individuals at firms including JPMorgan. UBS AG (UBSN) and Wells Fargo
            Co.'s Wachovia also agreed to pay penalties and enter into
            non-prosecution agreements over the charges of rigging bids in
            the municipal bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other banks that have entered into non- or deferred-prosecution agreements include London-based
            HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)
            Wachovia's cases focused on conduct before the lender's 2008
            acquisition by Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because a deferred-prosecution agreement or a plea
            agreement involves oversight by a judge, they are better tools
            to fix compliance issues than a non-prosecution agreement that
            is never filed in a court,' said Brandon Garrett, a professor
            at the University of Virginia School of Law who specializes in
            corporte crime. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is increasingly calling for
            corporate monitors in non- and deferred-prosecution agreements
            to review companies' compliance with the terms of the agreements
            and to ensure corporate reform, according to a 2008 department
            memo on the topic. The corporate monitors are usually employed
            by the firms and approved by the government. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan began offering its Global Special Opportunities
            unit, which has about $2 billion in assets, to potential buyers
            in the past few weeks, said the person, who asked not to be
            identified because the talks are confidential. Private-equity
            firms Blackstone Group LP (BX), Carlyle Group LP (CG) and KKR Co. among
            possible bidders for the business, which could fetch $1 billion,
            the Financial Times reported today, citing unidentified people
            familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit, which is based in Hong Kong, employs 35 people
            mostly in Asia and is run by Chris Nicholas. It invests the New
            York-based bank's money in distressed debt, non-performing loans
            and private equity. Federal bank regulators last week approved
            the Volcker Rule, which limits proprietary trading and investing
            by deposit-taking banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're doing a lot of what I call pruning,' Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, told investors at a
            conference last week. 'Simplify, pruning. You should do it all
            the time. Every year, businesses should look at what do I need,
            what don't I need, how do I serve my clients.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has already announced plans to spin off its
            private-equity unit, sell most of its physical commodities
            business and exit student lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
            to comment, as did Carlyle's Randy Whitestone and KKR's Kristi Huller. A Blackstone spokesman didn't
            immediately respond to
            messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan 10% Increase in Number of Junior Bankers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. plans to boost the number of junior investment bankers it employs by about 10
            percent and provide them with 'protected weekends' to reduce their workload, a person familiar with the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeff Urwin, the New York-based company's global head of investment banking,
            announced the changes on an internal conference call today, said the person, who didn't say how many people
            would be affected and asked not to be identified because the new policies aren't public. Jennifer
            Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the major Wall
            Street firms are planning to increase investment-banking staff in 2014, according to Jeanne Branthover, the
            head of financial-services recruitment at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York. They are also trying
            to protect their best employees from poaching as average pay at the biggest banks declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Business
            is better and they've stayed lean for so long,' Branthover said. 'People are burned out.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., which lowered the amount it set aside for employee compensation by 5 percent in the first
            nine months of the year, said in October that it was discouraging investment-banking analysts from working
            weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Trial of Len Blavatnik's Suit Against JPMorgan Ends</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Leonard Blavatnik's
            lawyers asked a New York judge to hold JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            responsible for stuffing a fund with risky mortgage securities
            and losing 10 percent of his $1 billion investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, ranked 49th on Bloomberg's billionaires
            index with a net worth of $16.2 billion, sued JPMorgan in New
            York state court in June 2009, accusing the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets of putting more money into mortgage securities in his
            CMMF fund than investment guidelines allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard I. Werder Jr., an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
            Urquhart Sullivan LLP who is representing Blavatnik, today
            asked Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer to order JPMorgan
            to pay more than $100 million in damages to the billionaire for
            the losses to the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're talking about this account being converted into a
            totally different kind of account than the one it was supposed
            to be,' Werder said during closing arguments in a two-week,
            nonjury trial in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Attorneys for New York-based JPMorgan have argued that CMMF
            rejected the 'most conservative strategy' it was offered in
            favor of one that sought a higher return than a money-market
            fund, with higher risk and less liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lewis R. Clayton, an attorney with Paul Weiss Rifkind
            Wharton Garrison LLP, representing JPMorgan, told Schweitzer
            today that the losses were the result of unexpected market
            conditions and that the mortgage securities purchased for the
            fund were 'remarkably liquid' until the financial crisis hit
            in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is classic backward-looking, after-the-fact second-
            guessing,' Clayton said during his closing argument. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schweitzer didn't indicate when he planned to rule. Werder
            said he expected a decision within several months, while Clayton
            declined to comment after today's proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
            Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Rental Rush For Wealthy Clients: Mortgages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is giving its wealthiest clients the chance to invest in the single-family
            rental market after other investments linked to the U.S. housing recovery jumped in value. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            firm's unit that caters to individuals and families with more than $5 million, put client money in a
            partnership that bought more than 5,000 single family homes to rent in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and
            California, said David Lyon, a managing director and investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
            Investors can expect returns of as much as 8 percent annually from rental income as well as part of the
            profits when the homes are sold, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank's wealthy clients are joining a
            growing number of private-equity firms and individuals buying rental homes in the regions hardest hit by the
            U.S. housing crash. Blackstone Group LP (BX) has spent $2.7 billion, and said last month it accelerated
            purchases as home prices rise faster than anticipated. Even after home values in November gained by the most
            in six years, investors are wagering on rental properties as an alternative to housing-related stocks and
            mortgage debt that's already soared. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The traditional places people might look --
            homebuilder stocks and appliance makers -- probably aren't the best places for new investments,' said John
            Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management in Aliso Viejo, California, which oversees
            about $4.5 billion. 'They've had fantastic runs.' &lt;/p&gt;

            PulteGroup Inc., the largest homebuilder by market value, was the biggest gainer on the Standard Poor's 500
            Index last year, rising 188 percent, helping an index of 11 builders more than double since the end of 2011,
            and raising concern among analysts including Michael Widner of Stifel Nicolaus Co. that growth is already
            priced in. Close

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest investment-grade bond
            loss in 14 months is bolstering Bank of America Corp. (BAC)'s view
            that the unprecedented bull market in the notes is over.
            JPMorgan Chase Co. disagrees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With bonds of the most-creditworthy borrowers from the U.S.
            to Europe and Asia losing 0.8 percent in January, Bank of
            America strategist Hans Mikkelsen cut his forecast for
            investment-grade debt returns last week, saying a sustained
            shift away from notes will cause borrowing costs to soar. At
            JPMorgan, Eric Beinstein said he's skeptical bond losses will
            deepen because the biggest debt buyers are unlikely to switch to
            equities and central banks will keep supporting the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Debt strategists at the two biggest U.S. banks are coming
            into conflict after a 44 percent rally since 2008 left yields at
            a record-low 2.55 percent in December and the best start to a
            year for stocks in two decades added $2.6 trillion to their
            market value. JPMorgan anticipates more government stimulus that
            bolsters credit as the International Monetary Fund lowers its
            forecast for global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Despite concerns about a potential rotation out of
            credit, demand for investment-grade debt will continue to be
            supported,' Greg Hall, managing director in debt capital
            markets at Barclays Plc in New York, wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, UBS Tricked Milan in Swaps Case, Judge Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and Depfa Bank Plc took advantage of the city of
            Milan, tricking the municipality into agreeing to a financing
            deal that didn't meet its objective of cutting borrowing costs,
            wrote the judge who convicted the four banks in the fraud case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks should have informed the municipality of the
            charges related to the derivatives that were part of the
            transactions, Judge Oscar Magi in Milan wrote today in
            explaining the convictions he handed down in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The city, which 'wasn't up to' carrying out its own
            analysis of the economic advantage of the financing package,
            needed protection and clear information, Magi said.
            'Information deficiencies manifested themselves and caused a
            grave asymmetry of information,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks, whose employees involved in the case were
            registered with Britain's Financial Services Authority, violated
            U.K. rules by failing to inform the city that it was a
            counterparty to the lenders rather than a customer. The banks
            acted as arrangers of a bond sale, or advisers to the
            municipality, as well as its counterparties, the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When contacted by Bloomberg News, the banks said they
            disagree with the verdict and plan to appeal, reiterating their
            stance following the December ruling. Chris Hamilton, a
            spokesman for the FSA in London, declined to immediately
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magi in December ordered that about 90 million euros ($122
            million) of assets be seized from the banks, the amount of their
            profit, and that they pay sanctions of 1 million euros each. He
            also convicted nine bankers of fraud and suspended their
            sentences. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge said Italian securities rules indicate that there
            is an obligation to disclose the cost of derivatives to the
            client, a duty that in this case was reinforced by the multiple
            roles played by the banks. Under FSA rules, banks are required
            to shield customers from conflicts of interest and failed to
            inform Milan of the 'obvious' conflict, Magi wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contracts, given the amounts involved, are likely to
            have been vetted by the most senior managers of the banks,
            according to Magi. The bankers then 'executed' directives they
            were given, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's $543 Million Madoff Trustee Settlement Approved</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $543 million settlement with the trustee for Bernard Madoff's defunct
            firm was approved by the judge overseeing its liquidation, ending a case in which thousands of investors
            accused the bank of turning a blind eye to the U.S.'s biggest Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord,
            reached Jan. 7, was approved today by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in New York. The deal resolves
            a lawsuit by the trustee, Irving Picard, and two related class-action cases filed by Madoff victims who
            accused the bank of negligence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The settlements are fair, reasonable and in the best
            interest of the Madoff estate,' Bernstein said. The deals provide 'substantial benefit' to victims, he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Madoff Ex-Aides Seen Facing Hurdle With 'Duped' Defense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With
            the JPMorgan deal, Picard's recoveries for victims topped $10 billion, or 59 percent of the $17 billion in
            principal lost by thousands of customers in Madoff's investment advisory business. Picard alleged the bank
            helped perpetuate Madoff's scam for years by ignoring signs of fraud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Madoff deposited
            money from new customers into the account instead of investing it in securities, and made withdrawals to pay
            back earlier investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed after Madoff's confession and arrest in December 2008.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard said New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, ignored signs of wrongdoing
            to benefit financially from the con man's business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Class Actions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            agreed to pay Picard $325 million to settle his lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims, and another $218
            million to resolve two related class-action lawsuits that were filed with Picard's assistance after an
            appeals court barred him from bringing common-law claims against the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard had
            appealed the JPMorgan decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which hasn't decided whether it will hear the
            case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amount of the accord 'indicated there was a value to the claims and the
            compromise made good sense,' David Sheehan, a lawyer for Picard, said at today's hearing. There is no
            guarantee Picard will win at the Supreme Court, Sheehan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A group of about 200
            Madoff victims who are 'net winners' -- customers who withdrew more money from the scam than they deposited
            -- get nothing under the deal and have said in court filings they will sue the bank. They advised Bernstein
            in court papers that they were declining to be part of the JPMorgan accord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Opting Out
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You're opting out of a class you're not a member of -- sounds like a Groucho Marx
            joke,' Bernstein said to a lawyer for the group at today's hearing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard is pursuing
            claims totaling about $3.5 billion from UBS AG (UBSN), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and UniCredit SpA (UCG),
            which the trustee has also accused of benefiting from Madoff's fraud. The banks have denied the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time Picard reached the deal with JPMorgan, the bank agreed to pay $1.7 billion to the
            U.S. to resolve related criminal allegations, and $350 million in a case by the Office of the Comptroller of
            the Currency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal investigators have
            resulted in a total recovery for victims of almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard
            has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions more held in reserve until legal issues are
            resolved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence
            at a federal prison in North Carolina. At least seven others pleaded guilty, including his brother Peter
            Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Picower Estate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the
            JPMorgan accord, Picard's team had recovered $9.5 billion through lawsuits and out-of-court settlements,
            including $5 billion from the estate of Jeffry Picower, who began investing with Madoff in the 1970s.
            Picower, whom Picard called the biggest beneficiary of Madoff's scheme, had a heart attack and drowned in a
            pool in Florida in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. investigators had recovered about $2.3 billion for
            Madoff investors before reaching their deal with JPMorgan, including $2.2 billion from Picower's estate and
            $100 million from Madoff's Midtown Manhattan penthouse apartment and other belongings. The JPMorgan deal
            brings total U.S. recoveries to $4 billion -- a sum it will distribute through a separate process from the
            one used by Picard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
            Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-bk-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
            York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. as the bank seeks to end a five-year
            foray into owning and storing materials such as metals and oil,
            according to two people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bid from Geneva-based Mercuria beat offers from
            Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) and Blackstone Group LP (BX), said one person,
            who asked not to be identified because the discussions are
            private. Blythe Masters, JPMorgan's commodities chief, probably
            won't join Mercuria as part of the deal, which is still being
            negotiated, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling the unit as regulators examine whether
            catastrophic losses at federally backed banks could endanger the
            financial system and lawmakers question whether firms have the
            power to manipulate some prices. The Federal Reserve said in
            July it might force insured lenders to get out of the business,
            and New York-based JPMorgan agreed later that month to pay $410
            million for claims that it manipulated power markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Mercuria and JPMorgan declined to comment, as
            did spokesmen for New York-based Blackstone and Sydney-based
            Macquarie. Reuters reported on the exclusive talks earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Morgan Stanley in Settling U.S. Mortgage Lawsuits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) agreed to pay $1.86 billion to end U.S. accusations of
            misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
            securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said yesterday it reached a $1.25 billion
            deal to end Federal Housing Finance Agency claims the bank sold
            faulty mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) before the
            firms' losses pushed them into U.S. conservatorship. JPMorgan
            will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted ineligible
            loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Affairs
            insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan 'put profits ahead of responsibility by
            recklessly churning out thousands of defective mortgage loans,
            failing to inform the government of known problems with those
            loans and leaving the government to cover the losses,'
            Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The six largest U.S. lenders have allocated more than $114
            billion since the financial crisis to cover legal expenses,
            government probes and mortgage-related claims. Morgan Stanley's
            deal with the FHFA prompted the New York-based bank to book an
            additional $150 million charge in the fourth quarter, reducing
            earnings for the period by 5 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Masters Said to Quit CFTC Panel After One Day</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s commodities head, withdrew from an advisory committee of
            the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission a day after her appointment was disclosed, according to two
            people with direct knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The regulator may include another
            executive from New York-based JPMorgan on the global markets committee, said one person close to the bank
            who requested anonymity because the move hasn't been publicly announced. Masters, 44, stepped down because
            the company's sale of its physical commodities unit will keep her occupied, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            is selling a division that deals in assets such as metals and oil, as government watchdogs examine whether
            federally backed lenders should be involved in such markets. Masters's appointment drew criticism from
            Twitter users who questioned the propriety of her advising the regulator of futures and swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Masters, whose name appeared on a list of committee members on the CFTC's website yesterday, had
            been scheduled to participate in a Feb. 12 meeting to discuss cross-border guidance on rules. She was
            invited to the panel by acting Chairman Mark Wetjen, said one of the people. Her name has since been removed
            from the list. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Offer Bad Debt as BlackRock Plans HSBC Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase Co. is offering $390
            million of non-performing loans as banks including HSBC Holdings
            Plc and Regions Financial Corp. increasingly look to sell
            troubled mortgage debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan put the pool of debt, a portion of which is tied
            to residential properties in New York, on the market this week,
            said two people with knowledge of the offering, who asked not to
            be named because the sale is private. HSBC hired BlackRock Inc.
            to manage the potential sale of as much as $1 billion in
            delinquent loans and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is handling an
            auction of about $700 million of modified loans for Regions,
            according to two separate people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of the debt are accelerating amid financial
            regulations that force banks to pledge more capital for some
            assets they hold, including non-performing loans, or NPLs. The
            government also is adding to the supply as it auctions the debt
            to help prevent foreclosures and stem losses at the Federal
            Housing Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Banks have made a decision internally that a delinquent
            borrower is not a core customer,'Ashish Pandey, chief
            executive officer of Altisource Residential Corp. (RESI), said at a
            conference in Las Vegas last month. Pandey, whose firm had 6,300
            delinquent loans as of the third quarter of 2013, said he
            expects as many as 500,000 non-performing loans to sell in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, GE Sell Least Samurai as Tight Spreads Deter Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and General
            Electric Co. (GE)'s finance arm had their smallest Samurai-bond sales
            in more than nine years as a global stock rout damped investor
            demand for debt that offered investors record-low yields. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;General Electric Capital Corp. sold 55 billion yen ($536
            million) in three-year fixed-rate, yen-denominated notes that
            pay 0.313 percent on Feb. 6, while JPMorgan offered 48.5 billion
            yen in a two-tranche deal, including three-year fixed-rate notes
            offering 0.373 percent. Those rates are the lowest ever paid by
            the companies on the yen-denominated debt, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese investors are wary of buying overseas debt
            offering such low yields after concerns that the Chinese economy
            is slowing and the impact from U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus
            cuts triggered a selloff in emerging-market currencies and
            global stocks. JPMorgan joined Morgan Stanley last week in
            agreeing to pay $1.86 billion to settle U.S. accusations of
            misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
            securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
            global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Compared with notes from local issuers, Samurai bonds are
            more exposed to overseas risk,' said Yoshihiro Nakatani, a
            Tokyo-based senior fund manager who oversees about 100 billion
            yen of bonds at Asahi Life Asset Management Co. 'Spreads on
            Samurai have fallen to unattractive levels, and it will be
            difficult for Japanese investors to buy at the kind of rates
            offered by JPMorgan and GE in future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Spread 'Unattractive' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakatani, who has invested in GE Capital's debt in the
            past, said he didn't buy the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
            company's notes this time because the spread was
            'unattractive.' He doesn't invest in U.S. banks like JPMorgan
            as they can be affected more by financial regulation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tom Steiner, a London-based spokesman for GE Capital,
            declined to comment on the company's sale. Yukako Yoshino, a
            spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Tokyo, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last had a Samurai sale smaller than last week's
            in September 2004, when it issued 25 billion yen in notes,
            following two bigger sales the same year, according to
            Bloomberg-compiled data. General Electric hasn't had a smaller
            sale, according to the data going back to 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE Capital sold 95 billion yen of Samurai notes in
            September, including 72.1 billion yen in debt also 10 basis
            points over yen swaps. The spread on securities of the same
            length offered last week declined to 4 basis points. A basis
            point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan issued 105.6 billion yen of Samurai bonds in June,
            including 51.5 billion yen in three-year notes at 10 basis
            points over swaps, the same level as last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Falling Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average spread on Samurais was at 41 basis points on
            Feb. 6, the least since November 2007, according to Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE is rated AA+ by Standard Poor's, its second-highest
            ranking, and four levels above the A grade it gives JPMorgan.
            SP lowered its outlook on JPMorgan to negative from stable in
            June, saying that the likelihood of 'extraordinary' government
            support for the U.S. bank is waning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Topix index of Japanese shares has fallen 8.7 percent
            this year after a 52 percent gain in 2013. The gauge rose on
            Feb. 7 to pare a fifth straight week of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Stock prices are falling and investors are worried, so
            they aren't going after credit investments,' said Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas in
            Tokyo, in a
            telephone interview. 'There's very little incentive to make
            investments at such low levels at a difficult time to assess
            risk.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Seller &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. seller of Samurai bonds since
            the global financial crisis, issuing 426.7 billion yen of the
            notes from 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            General Electric is the second largest, at 370.7 billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuers from Australia to Norway have raised about 370
            billion yen via Samurai sales this year, up from 60 billion for
            the entire first quarter of last year. National Australia Bank
            Ltd. is the biggest issuer of the securities this year, having
            sold 123.8 billion yen last month. Norway's DNB Bank ASA sold
            81.6 billion yen also in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Following the emerging-market shock, and possibility of
            spreads widening for overseas names, there appears to have been
            a feeling that there wasn't a need to rush to buy GE Capital's
            Samurai this time,' said Yusuke Ueda, a Tokyo-based credit
            analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For JPMorgan, 'the
            tone seems to have been a little different' and the bank had
            less of a need to sell Samurai debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted
            ineligible loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
            Affairs insurance, according to a statement on Feb. 4 by the
            U.S. Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement the same day that the
            'settlement represents another significant step in the firm's
            efforts to put historical mortgage-related issues behind it.'
            The bank separately agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle
            Federal Housing Finance Agency claims related to about $33
            billion in mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Under normal circumstances, JPMorgan probably would have
            liked to sell a lot, lot more bonds' at a premium of as little
            as 10 basis points, said BNP's Nakazora said. 'It's litigation
            risk has been very big.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's $13 Billion Accord Seen Needing Court Review</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $13 billion
            fraud settlement with the U.S. government should be blocked
            until a court is able to review it, a Wall Street watchdog group
            founded by an Atlanta hedge fund manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets Inc. is seeking judicial scrutiny of the
            accord because it's the largest settlement 'with a single
            entity in the 237-year history of the U.S.,' according to a
            complaint filed today in Washington federal court. 'No one has
            any ability to determine if the $13 billion agreement is fair'
            or 'if it is a sweetheart deal,' the group said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord, announced in November, settled allegations that
            the biggest U.S. lender by assets misled investors and the
            public when it sold bonds backed by faulty residential
            mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed JPMorgan's actions
            for helping to cause the credit crisis, and said the agreement
            didn't shield JPMorgan or its employees from possible charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department 'acted as investigator, prosecutor,
            judge, juror, sentencer and collector,' Dennis Kelleher, chief
            executive officer of Better Markets, said at a press conference
            in Washington. The agreement was 'mostly designed to conceal,
            not reveal.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The department is confident that the settlement reached
            with JPMorgan Chase complies with the law,' Ellen Canale, a
            Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Financial Reform' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets describes itself as 'a nonprofit,
            nonpartisan organization that promotes the public interest in
            financial reform.' It was founded by Michael Masters, founder
            and managing member of Atlanta-based Masters Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group expects that its standing to bring the complaint
            will be challenged, Kelleher said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It will be hotly contested but I believe we have a solid
            foundation to prove and demonstrate concrete and demonstrable
            harm that give us ample standing to assert both the
            constitutional claims and the statutory claims,' Kelleher said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If we do not, what that means is that no one in the
            United States can ever challenge a backroom deal like this cut
            by any attorney general,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets' standing derives from its public interest
            purpose being thwarted by a lack of transparency in the
            settlement process and the lack of a 'judicial forum in which
            it could seek to participate to influence' the outcome, the
            group said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Novel Claim' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint doesn't cite any precedents for challenges to
            similar Justice Department settlements with banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think it's fair to call it a novel claim,' driven by
            uniquely damaging and far-reaching circumstances, Kelleher said
            in a phone interview following his press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least one portion of the settlement, a $2 billion civil
            penalty obtained under the Financial Institutions Reform,
            Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, explicitly
            required a court to levy the sanction, according to the
            complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets also alleged that the Justice Department and
            U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder 'have an apparent conflict of
            interest' because they have been criticized for failing to be
            tough enough on large Wall Street firms and 'have aggressively
            used the $13 billion agreement to try to restore their
            reputations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement is 'a mere contract' whereby JPMorgan
            agreed to pay 'in exchange for complete civil immunity from DOJ
            for years of pervasive, egregious and knowing alleged fraud and
            other illegal conduct related to the worst financial crash in
            the U.S. since 1929,' according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Better Markets Inc. v. U.S. Department of
            Justice, 14-cv-00190, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
            (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Employee Falls to Death From Building Roof in Hong Kong</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) employee fell
            to his death from the roof of Chater House, the investment
            bank's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A sad and tragic incident occurred in Chater House, Hong
            Kong, which is currently being investigated by the police,'
            JPMorgan said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The bank
            declined to comment further 'out of respect for those involved.
            Our thoughts and sympathy are with the family that's involved at
            this difficult point of time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Hong Kong police official, who asked not to be identified
            in line with the agency's policy, said the person was certified
            dead at the hospital. The man was a junior employee in a
            supporting function who didn't work as a trader or investment
            banker, said a JPMorgan employee who asked not to be identified
            because they weren't authorized to release the information until
            the man's family overseas are contacted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A Chinese male in his thirties' was found in front of
            the building at about 1:55 p.m. yesterday, Lee Kwok Wing, senior
            manager for security and support services of building owner
            Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., said at the scene. The building at
            8 Connaught Road Central is 30 stories high, according to
            Hongkong Land's website. JPMorgan occupies the top 10 floors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other building tenants include Franklin Templeton
            Investment Funds, Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., Pictet Asset
            Management (HK) Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last month, a 39-year-old vice president in technology
            operations died after falling from JPMorgan's London

        <headline>JPMorgan Said Cut Tie to Saudi Bank Amid Focus on Control</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) dropped Al-Rajhi Bank, the world's largest Shariah-compliant lender, as a
            correspondent banking client amid a push to improve risk controls, said two people with direct knowledge of
            the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The relationship with Saudi Arabia's biggest publicly traded bank ended Dec.
            31 because JPMorgan couldn't get enough information on where payments in dollar-clearing services for
            Al-Rajhi had originated, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the decision wasn't public.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it cut off the service to about 500 foreign lenders last year as
            regulators press the world's biggest banks to verify that transactions are used for legitimate business. The
            crackdown seeks to halt funds tied to money laundering, terrorism and countries covered by economic
            sanctions. Correspondent accounts allow lenders to take deposits or make payments on behalf of foreign
            institutions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan has to be extra careful to make sure they're adhering to
            standards and not even approaching anything questionable,' said David Kass, a professor at the University of
            Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two banks haven't been cited by U.S.
            regulators for involvement in illegal money transfers. Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
            comment on clients of the company, which is based in New York and ranks as the nation's largest lender by
            assets. A spokesman for Al-Rajhi (RJHI) didn't respond to inquiries, and there was no response to messages
            sent to the firm's Riyadh headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Profit Up 50% in Five Years Amid Job Cuts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said the bank
            can increase profit 50 percent in the next four to five years as
            higher rates boost interest margins and the firm cuts 5,500 more
            jobs from retail units than it had forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Profit can reach $27 billion if legal costs subside and
            income from loans and investments improves, the New York-based
            company said today in a slide presentation for its annual
            investor day. The bank now plans to eliminate about 8,000 jobs
            in consumer and mortgage banking this year as demand wanes for
            refinancings. Hiring in areas such as compliance and risk
            management will offset some of the cuts, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Managers led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon are
            laying out strategy at the biggest U.S. bank by assets after a
            year marred by clashes with regulators and $23 billion in legal
            costs. Dimon, 57, is seeking to accelerate growth and trim
            unwanted units while fending off allegations that the firm
            misled buyers of mortgage bonds, rigged markets and ignored
            suspicious activity by clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We now have clarity on most of the regulatory rules, and
            we believe that we, more than others, will successfully adapt to
            the new financial architecture and will emerge where we started
            -- with best-in-class margins and returns,' Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake said at the investor conference. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mayo Asks Erdoes How It Feels at Unit Trapped at JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mike Mayo, the analyst who sparred
            at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s 2013 investor day with Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon, challenged the bank at today's event about
            the logic of holding an asset-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., asked Mary Erdoes, CEO of
            JPMorgan's asset manager, how it feels to be 'trapped' in a
            bank that he estimates is valued at about 40 percent less than
            companies in her business, based on price-to-earnings ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You would probably be worth a lot more as a standalone,'
            Mayo said. 'How does it feel to be a 17 P-E business trapped in
            a 10 P-E company?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon has said clients benefit from the array of services
            provided by his New York-based company. JPMorgan is the largest
            U.S. bank, and today's session featured presentations by
            commercial, retail and investment bankers, along with Erdoes,
            who oversees more than $2 trillion. She said her unit helps
            JPMorgan meet 'holistic needs' of customers, and that the
            valuation hasn't hurt compensation of top money managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We work very hard to deliver the whole company to the
            clients,' Erdoes said today. 'Someday we believe that all the
            value of this part of the business will be reflected in the
            stock price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has advanced 20 percent in the past 12 months,
            beating the 14 percent gain of T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW), while
            trailing BlackRock Inc. (BLK)'s 27 percent rally. JPMorgan trades for
            about 8.6 times reported earnings, less than half the ratio at
            BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The stock has done fine as a competitive matter, against
            most major competitors,' Dimon told Mayo today. 'More than
            fine, which you've noted yourself in some of your analyst
            reports.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July 2012, Mayo said Morgan Stanley (MS) would be worth as
            much as $32 if the firm were broken up. The bank, which didn't
            heed his call, has since more than doubled to $29.71 at 4 p.m.
            in New York. The gain was fueled by improved profitability at
            its brokerage unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mayo asked Dimon at last year's gathering if clients might
            shift to banks with the highest capital ratios, citing UBS AG as
            one company that could seek to win business from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon countered, 'so you would go to UBS' rather than
            JPMorgan? 'I didn't say that,' Mayo responded. 'I said that
            was their argument.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's why I'm richer than you,' Dimon said, drawing
            laughter from the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan Move of 2,000 Workers to Brooklyn</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender, is moving about 2,000 employees to offices in
            Brooklyn's MetroTech Center after a review of its real estate holdings, said a person with direct knowledge
            of the plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest single source of employees heading to Brooklyn by year-end is 1
            Chase Manhattan Plaza, the 60-story lower Manhattan skyscraper the bank sold to Shanghai-based Fosun
            International Ltd. (656) in 2013, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the move isn't
            public. The employees are from several of the bank's business lines, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            is consolidating its real estate as it pushes to trim expenses and simplify itself by exiting businesses
            including student lending and private equity. Offices in and near downtown Brooklyn, where MetroTech Center
            is located, are among the most in demand in the city, in particular drawing young technology and
            social-media companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan follows through with its plans, it will show that
            the market also can appeal to traditional financial firms while it tries to attract and retain young talent,
            said Tucker Reed, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a group representing local businesses.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Were they to come, it would be a validation of our office market here,' Reed said in a
            telephone interview. 'The only drawback, if you can call it that, would be the challenge it creates. It
            means there would be even less office space for us to grow into. It makes our space dilemma a little more
            acute, but that's a good problem to have.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tightest Market &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooklyn's
            15.5 million square feet (1.4 million square meters) of offices are more than 96 percent occupied, data from
            CBRE Group Inc. show. By comparison, Manhattan's tightest office market -- the area roughly from 30th to
            Canal streets, known as midtown south -- has a 93 percent occupancy rate, according to the real estate
            services firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MetroTech Center is a 3.7 million-square-foot office campus close to the
            Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. JPMorgan owns two buildings at the complex. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another
            group of Chase Plaza-based staff members is bound for the bank's offices at the Newport office complex on
            Washington Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, the person said. The transfers started in December and will
            continue throughout 2014, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender intends to keep about
            300,000 to 400,000 square feet of offices at Chase Plaza, the person said. JPMorgan occupied about half the
            space in the 2.2 million-square-foot tower, according to data from CoStar Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're
            continually looking at ways to ensure that our space and occupancy strategy aligns with the ever-evolving
            needs of our business,' Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MetroTech
            Space &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As recently as 2012, JPMorgan considered giving up at least some of its offices
            at MetroTech, listing about 700,000 square feet for rent, according to the person. After floods from
            Hurricane Sandy damaged bank offices at 4 New York Plaza, another downtown Manhattan tower, displaced
            workers were moved temporarily into the Brooklyn space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan owns 4 MetroTech
            Center, with about 1.35 million square feet, and 3 MetroTech Center, according to Mrofficespace.com, a
            website that tracks New York office buildings. The other six buildings at the office park are owned by
            Forest City Ratner Cos., which started building MetroTech in the late 1980s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 16-acre
            (6.5-hectare) campus was Brooklyn's first modern office development, built in partnership with the New York
            City government. Many of its earlier tenants have been financial firms, including Bank of New York and Bear
            Stearns Cos., which used the properties for back-office operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the
            complex has attracted technology and media companies such as MakerBot Industries LLC, a developer of
            three-dimensional printers; and ImpreMedia LLC, which publishes Hispanic newspapers including New York's El
            Diario La Prensa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Downtown Brooklyn has now become a very diverse ecosystem of varied
            companies that are more reflective of all of Brooklyn and all of New York City,' said Ali Esmaeilzadeh, vice
            president of commercial development and leasing at Forest City Ratner. 'There's still the presence of
            government and back-office, there's also a surge in technology-based firms, entrepreneurial-type companies.'

        <headline>JPMorgan Adopts Pew Disclosure Form for Prepaid Card Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, adopted a new disclosure form for its
            prepaid card to provide greater clarity on fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The disclosure, based on a model released by Pew Charitable
            Trusts, gives customers a description of fees and when deposits
            are available in an easy-to-read format, the New York-based bank
            said today in a statement. Pew is a Washington-based non-profit
            research firm specializing in trends and public attitudes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Government agencies including the Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau are pushing financial firms to make their
            retail products easier to understand. The amount loaded onto
            prepaid cards by U.S. consumers more than doubled in 2012 to $64
            billion from 2009, according to Pew's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This disclosure box should be required by the Consumer
            Financial Protection Bureau for all general purpose reloadable
            prepaid cards,' Susan Weinstock, director of Pew's safe
            checking research, said on the trust's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samuel Gilford, spokesman for the Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau, didn't immediately respond to inquiries about
            the Pew standard. U.S. Senator Mark R. Warner, a Virginia
            Democrat on the Banking Committee, has introduced legislation
            requiring financial institutions to be more upfront with prepaid
            cards. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, who built JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) into the world's biggest investment bank, said
            threats to its dominance may come from Beijing, Silicon Valley
            and a San Francisco-based rival with a stage-coach logo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We know there are going to be attacks everywhere,' Dimon
            told investors at an annual meeting yesterday at the firm's New
            York headquarters. Asked about challengers, the chief executive
            officer cited companies from Industrial Commercial Bank of
            China Ltd. (601398) to Google Inc. Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), founded in 1852 to
            serve California's Gold Rush pioneers, will be 'a major
            investment bank' within five years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, guided JPMorgan through the financial crisis
            without posting a quarterly loss and expanded the firm by
            acquiring rivals that faltered. As the company grappled with
            costs from government probes last year, its profit was surpassed
            by Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. lender, which relies
            most on retail banking and mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'My operating assumption has always been and always will
            be that we are going to have huge, tough competition from
            Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo to some new entrants,' Dimon
            said. 'Wells Fargo will be in our business. I have enormous
            respect for them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, led by CEO John Stumpf, 60, has been expanding
            its securities unit. The lender opened trading floors in 2012 in
            Charlotte, North Carolina, bolstering a securities business
            acquired with the purchase of Wachovia Corp. four years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'They're Huge' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICBC (1398), based in Beijing, is seeking to triple earnings from
            outside its home country by 2016. China's biggest financial
            firms are 'ambitious' and have 'strategic reason to win,'
            Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're huge, their clients are huge,' he said. 'I
            expect very large, tough Chinese competitors all around the
            world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan generated $26.6 billion of revenue from corporate
            advisory, underwriting and trading in 2013, the most of any
            global investment bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the major U.S. bank most reliant on
            trading, had $34.2 billion in total revenue, including other
            businesses such as asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California technology companies are delving into electronic
            payments. Google (GOOG), based in Mountain View, created Wallet, a
            program that lets users make transactions in stores and online
            with their smartphones. Cupertino-based Apple Inc., which has
            more than 400 million credit cards on file with its iTunes
            Store, is exploring an expansion of its mobile-payments system,
            a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EBay's PayPal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EBay Inc.'s PayPal unit is a leading online payments
            system, which accounts for 40 percent of the San Jose-based
            company's revenue and has 143 million active users. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology companies 'all want to eat our lunch,' Dimon
            said. 'I mean every single one of them, and they're going to
            try.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon may be overstating his firm's vulnerability to blunt
            criticism of its size, said Erik Gordon, a business professor at
            the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. JPMorgan is the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets and the country's largest credit-card
            lender. It counts 80 percent of the Fortune 500 as clients,
            according to presentations at yesterday's meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He's downplaying the fact that at the end of the day,
            JPMorgan is probably as powerful as any financial institution,
            including going back to the original JPMorgan,' Gordon said in
            a telephone interview. 'It's his way of saying, 'Don't be
            afraid of us and how big we are.' My guess is that he doesn't
            really go home at night and worry about Wells Fargo.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cutting Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon's comments on long-term threats came near the end of
            his company's annual investor meeting. The bank can increase
            profit by 50 percent to $27 billion in four to five years as
            higher rates boost interest margins and legal costs subside,
            according to presentations posted yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also said it would eliminate about 8,000 jobs in
            consumer and mortgage banking this year, while hiring in areas
            such as compliance and risk management. Dimon said he will stick
            with home lending, after calling mortgages 'the most painful
            business ever.' The loans fill a key need for consumers, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan slipped 0.6 percent to $56.67 at 9:44 a.m. in New
            York after dropping 1.7 percent yesterday. It has gained 19
            percent in the past 12 months, trailing the 24 percent advance
            of the Standard Poor's 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading revenue dropped about 15 percent so far this year
            compared with the same period in 2013, Dimon said yesterday.
            Lower levels of client activity, especially in fixed income,
            pressured results, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Dog Days' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's earnings last year were marred by clashes with
            regulators and $23 billion in legal settlements that contributed
            to the bank's first quarterly loss under Dimon. The CEO is
            selling or closing businesses he considers risky and dropping
            non-U.S. clients who may invite regulatory scrutiny. He's
            fending off allegations the firm rigged markets and ignored
            suspicious activity by clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday's meeting concluded on an upbeat note, with a
            song from English rock band Florence + the Machine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The dog days are over,' the lyrics blared from speakers.
            'The dog days are done.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan $300 Million Accord Over Kickback Claim Approved</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A $300 million settlement by
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and insurers with homeowners who accused
            the bank of taking kickbacks in exchange for sticking them with
            overpriced insurance policies was approved by a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami today approved
            the accord. It requires JPMorgan, Assurant Inc. (AIZ) and other
            insurers to pay refunds valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium
            costs to homeowners who had certain policies placed on their
            properties by the bank starting in January 2008. JPMorgan and
            Assurant didn't admit wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The homeowners sued New York-based JPMorgan last year,
            claiming the bank placed required hazard and wind coverage with
            Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates. Some of the
            excess costs were kicked back to a JPMorgan unit, the homeowners
            alleged in their class-action, or group, lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among several large banks facing claims by
            homeowners that they overcharged mortgage borrowers for lender-placed insurance. Last year, New York-based
            Assurant agreed to
            pay $14 million to resolve similar allegations by the New York
            State Department of Financial Services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his ruling, Moreno rejected objections to the settlement
            and approved $20 million in fees to lawyers for the class. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Saccoccio v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 13-cv-21107, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of Florida
            (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wall Street Hates JPMorgan Fee for $1 Trillion Junk Loans</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;On Wall Street, $3,500 goes further than anyone dared imagine in the 1980s when the predecessor to
            JPMorgan Chase Co. charged the fee to trade each non-investment grade loan it sold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
            surcharge remains the same today and helps the biggest U.S. bank dominate the secretive $1.1 trillion
            junk-loan market while stifling profits for investors and rivals, which mostly stopped charging it years
            ago. The New York-based bank waives it for exclusive customers: trade with JPMorgan, no fee; trade one of
            its loans with anyone else, pay up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan can dictate terms because of its size,
            according to 12 people with knowledge of the matter who are concerned they'd jeopardize their business if
            their identities were revealed. The bank brings more corporate debt to market than anyone, and competitors
            and investors say they might be shut out of future deals if they don't play by JPMorgan's rules. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'This is one of the last frontiers of relatively unregulated, over-the-counter trading between
            financial giants,' said Jose Gabilondo, a law professor at Florida International University in Miami who
            focuses on corporate finance. 'You're dealing with a market that doesn't have regulated disclosure
            requirements getting the information out in the market.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Riskier Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The issue goes beyond pinched profits for rivals and investors such as pension plans and hedge
            funds that buy the loans. It's also about what may happen when riskier investments lose their appeal. Since
            the fees make it unprofitable for JPMorgan competitors to trade loans made by the bank, buying and selling
            the debt may become difficult and put at risk individual investors, who own more of the loans through mutual
            funds than ever before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, declined to
            comment on the bank's practice of charging the trading fees or the way in which the charge affects how
            quickly investors can move in and out of the market. The bank has more than 1,200 predecessor institutions,
            according to its website, and became JPMorgan Chase in 2000 after J.P. Morgan Co. merged with Chase
            Manhattan Corp., which had earlier combined with Chemical Banking Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is at
            the center of an unprecedented expansion in global corporate debt markets, which have become more popular
            with investors seeking alternatives to government securities as central banks hold interest rates at record
            lows to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Underwriter &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The market value of bonds
            in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate High Yield Index has soared to $10.5 trillion from
            $5.15 trillion in 2008. The market for institutional junk-rated loans, given to the most indebted companies,
            increased to $688.3 billion last year, exceeding the 2007 peak of $596 billion, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan was the biggest
            underwriter of corporate bonds last year, with a 6.8 percent share of the $3.27 trillion issued, compared
            with 6.1 percent for No. 2 Bank of America Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was also the
            top-ranked manager of U.S. syndicated loan sales, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2007, JPMorgan's
            assets have grown 55 percent and its customer deposits have risen 74 percent. The bank ranks first in the
            U.S. in both categories. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Junk loans, also called high-yield or leveraged loans, are a
            lucrative business for banks at a time when new regulations designed to make the financial system safer are
            forcing them to cut back on businesses such as trading for their own accounts. Banks have typically earned 1
            percent to 5 percent selling pieces of the debt to institutional investors such as pension plans and mutual
            funds, according to Standard Poor's data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Banking Behemoth &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
            compares with almost nothing to manage sales of investment-grade loans, given to companies with good credit,
            and an average 1.3 percent on sales of junk bonds last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Banks also
            earn an annual fee from borrowers to handle the paperwork, making sure everyone gets paid what they're owed.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $3,500 add-on might seem like a mote of dust on the $2.4 trillion balance sheet of a
            banking behemoth such as JPMorgan. Still, the fees add up because trades often consist of multiple
            transactions and JPMorgan charges for each. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, if an investment firm buys a $2
            million slice of a loan administered by JPMorgan and then parcels it out to four of its funds, it would be
            forced to pay $14,000 if a dealer other than JPMorgan brokers the trade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Additional
            Inefficiencies' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a nuisance and it creates additional inefficiencies,' David
            Breazzano, the president and chief investment officer of Waltham, Massachusetts-based DDJ Capital Management
            LLC, said in an interview. DDJ manages more than $7 billion in high-yield assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rivals
            said they're reluctant to trade many deals that JPMorgan helped to originally distribute because it's too
            costly. Rather than finding ways to circumvent the biggest U.S. bank, investors usually give in and trade
            the debt only with JPMorgan, said the people who requested anonymity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rivals said
            they're also concerned that if they don't comply, JPMorgan may not give them opportunities to buy new deals
            the bank brings to market. That would hurt their business because their customers are giving them more cash
            to invest in high-yield loans than ever before, the people said. Perras, the JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The loans are widely traded. Last year's $517 billion of transactions were
            within $3 billion of the all-time high in 2007, SP and Loan Syndications and Trading Association data show.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial Burden &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More plentiful trading has 'dramatically
            increased the financial burden that assignment fees have imposed,' said Barry Zamore, the head of U.S.
            non-distressed, leveraged-loan trading for Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. 'Assignment fees were meant
            for the manual processes in the year 1995, not 2014.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the 2008 financial crisis,
            international rules penalized financial institutions for keeping the loans on their books by requiring them
            to hold more capital in case the debt goes bad. Banks found ready buyers in an economy distorted by the
            Federal Reserve's near-zero benchmark interest rate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans have returned 81
            percent in the past five years through January, about five times the 16.6 percent return of the Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Junk loans differ from junk bonds even though
            many investors buy both. Finance laws drafted after the Great Depression of the 1930s didn't consider junk
            loans to be securities because they were mostly private transactions between one bank and one borrower.
            Since the government already supervised banks, lawmakers saw no need to double up by regulating their loans,
            too. Today, banks sell most of the loans to institutions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Relative Darkness &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's impossible to estimate from public regulatory filings how much JPMorgan earns from the fees.
            Trading data isn't available on a loan-specific level. Banks don't disclose such detailed earnings, nor are
            they legally required to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of transparency allows the trading of leveraged loans
            to go on in relative darkness, said Elisabeth de Fontenay, a Duke Law School professor in Durham, North
            Carolina, who previously worked as a corporate lawyer at Ropes Gray LLP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            leveraged-loan market is at once the most dynamic and the least visible capital market in the U.S., which is
            exactly how its participants like it,' de Fontenay said in an academic article presented at the 2013 Law and
            Society Association conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn't
            tried to regulate the loans as securities, such oversight would lead to pressure to lower or eliminate fees,
            de Fontenay said in a telephone interview this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lotus Spreadsheets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market will be tested when sentiment deteriorates, she said. It's happened before. Prices fell
            as low as 59.2 cents on the dollar during the 2008 credit crisis, SP and LSTA data show. They hit a high of
            98.9 cents on Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's fee is a relic from a time when clerks used Lotus
            spreadsheets to track transactions and the market for junk loans was less than 2 percent the size it is now.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loan trades can still take weeks to settle, and until 2012 traders relied on fax
            machines to place orders. In contrast, junk bonds are increasingly traded electronically and have prices
            that are publicly reported through Trace, run by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's dominance dates from 1982, when banker James B. Lee Jr. created a loan syndication unit
            to sell pieces of debt for JPMorgan predecessor Chemical Bank, according to a press release for a New York
            Public Library event honoring Lee in 2008. Lee is now a JPMorgan vice chairman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stopped
            Charging &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 1999, another JPMorgan predecessor, Chase Manhattan, handled 44 percent of
            the $22 billion of loans to the least creditworthy companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan managed the distribution of $133.7 billion of junk-rated loans, the
            second-biggest share among banks. Bank of America has been the top underwriter since 2008 after combining
            with Merrill Lynch Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America charges the $3,500 fee to JPMorgan, Royal Bank of
            Canada and Jefferies Group LLC, according to two people familiar with the trades. The Charlotte, North
            Carolina-based bank waives the fee for most of its rivals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2005, Credit Suisse,
            Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and 10 other
            banks agreed to mostly stop charging each other's clients the standard $3,500 fee to trade loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Impediment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are still protesting 10 years after an August
            2004 LSTA survey in which market participants said the surcharges are 'an impediment for the loan market.'
            The fee reduced competition, making it cost more to enter and exit the growing market, investors said at the
            time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'These fees are associated with froth,' said Gabilondo of Florida International
            University. 'The bank probably feels that it can skim a little bit off because there's some investor on the
            other side who's so willing to hold these that they're willing to pay a transaction fee.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mutual
            funds, whose investors are often quick to buy and sell, account for about 33 percent of the market,
            according to data from SP and the LSTA. They channeled a record $63 billion into the debt last year,
            compared with net withdrawals in 2007. Retirees and pensioners are turning to leveraged loans, which pay
            more when benchmark interest rates rise, instead of junk bonds, which are tied to fixed benchmark rates.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yields on junk loans issued this year are an average 5.03 percent, according to SP's
            Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary Data. That compares with the yield on 10-year Treasury bond of 2.64 percent.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a surprisingly concentrated market,' said de Fontenay of Duke Law School. 'Right
            now there's so much artificial demand for loans. In the long run it will be an issue.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seeks Liability Shield in WaMu Bondholder Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) asked a federal
            judge to order the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to cover any
            costs or liabilities in a bondholder case stemming from the
            bank's takeover of Washington Mutual Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in a filing today in Washington, said that under
            the terms of a 2008 agreement with the FDIC it shouldn't be on
            the hook for any damages, attorneys' fees or court costs in a
            lawsuit filed by Washington Mutual bondholders accusing the bank
            of being involved in a scheme to deprive them of their
            investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When it picked up Washington Mutual banking operations in
            September 2008, JPMorgan 'assumed only certain defined
            liabilities,' which didn't include WaMu's bond obligations,
            according to the filing. WaMu's debt obligations -- including
            the bonds at issue in the case -- were liabilities that remained
            with the FDIC, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a result of this action, the JPMC defendants have
            suffered significant harm,' attorney Brent McIntosh of Sullivan
            Cromwell LLP wrote in the filing, referring to the suit. New
            York-based JPMorgan has 'been forced to litigate this action
            for close to four years and incurred substantial costs and
            expenses,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A federal judge dismissed the suit in 2010 after finding
            that the bondholders hadn't sought recovery through the FDIC's
            administrative claims process. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Case Revived &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case was revived on appeal in 2011 by a three-judge
            panel, which ruled that the court had jurisdiction because the
            bondholders' allegations of wrongdoing were made against
            JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If JPMorgan thinks the FDIC is responsible for the
            damages my client suffered, that is between them,' Andrew J.
            Mytelka, a lawyer for the bondholders, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Barr, an FDIC spokesman, said the agency doesn't
            comment on active litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is American National Insurance Co. v. Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corp., 09-cv-01743, U.S. District Court,
            District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees $850 Million Fourth-Quarter Cost of Madoff Accords</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. boosted legal
            reserves following accords tied to the collapse of Bernard
            Madoff's Ponzi scheme and said the cost of settlements reduced
            fourth-quarter net income by about $850 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank added about $400 million to litigation reserves in
            the 2013 fourth quarter on a pretax basis, the New York-based
            company said today in a regulatory filing. JPMorgan is the
            largest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan 'Failed Miserably' in Madoff Case, Bharara Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which agreed to
            pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations it
            facilitated Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, 'failed miserably'
            as a financial institution, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One reason, among others, that Madoff was able to get
            away with his crime for so long was that JPMorgan had an
            inadequate and inefficient anti-money-laundering program,'
            Bharara said at a press conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
            prosecution by entering into an accord with Bharara's office
            that acknowledged oversight lapses related to an account Madoff
            used to fund his fraud. The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion
            to settle the U.S. allegations, $350 million in a related case
            by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, plus
            $543 million to cover separate private claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The bank connected the dots when it came to its own
            profits, but not when it came to its own legal obligations,'
            Bharara said, adding that the bank was aware of Madoff's
            questionable transactions as early as 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank didn't file any suspicious activity
            reports required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Timeline Chart &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Bank Secrecy Act is a law that requires financial
            institutions to establish and maintain effective anti-money
            laundering compliance programs and to know their customer,'
            Bharara said. 'It is not a tip. It is not a suggestion. It is a
            legal requirement enforceable through criminal sanction. Today's
            charges have been filed because in this regard, JPMorgan as an
            institution failed and failed miserably.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the press conference, Bharara displayed a timeline chart
            with comments by JPMorgan employees who suspected Madoff's
            fraud, which ended when he was arrested in December 2008 and
            cost investors about $17 billion. Madoff is serving a 150-year
            federal prison sentence in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan fund manager wrote in December 1998 that
            Madoff's returns are 'possibly too good to be true' and that
            there were 'too many red flags' for the bank to do business
            with Madoff, according to the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In June 2007, a senior JPMorgan chief risk officer said
            'there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that
            his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme,'
            according to the exhibit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
            forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
            penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
            other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We recognize we could have done a better job pulling
            together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff
            from different parts of the bank over time,' Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in an
            e-mailed
            statement. 'We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee
            knowingly assisted Madoff's Ponzi scheme.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From late 1986 to the Madoff firm's collapse, the Ponzi
            scheme 'was conducted almost exclusively through a demand
            deposit account and other linked cash and brokerage accounts
            held at JPMorgan,' prosecutors said in a criminal information
            in Manhattan federal court. 'Virtually all client investments
            were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at
            JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and virtually all client 'redemptions'
            were paid from a linked disbursement account.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Vantage Point' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan, because of its vantage point as Madoff's
            banker, had plenty of reasons to be uniquely suspicious about
            him. Warning signs abounded,' Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The volume, movement and use of funds should have generated
            suspicions among JPMorgan employees, Bharara said. From 1986 to
            2008 'an astounding $150 billion' went in and out of Madoff's
            JPMorgan account. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2006, a derivatives trading desk in JPMorgan's London
            office offered products linked to Madoff's performance and
            invested its own money in Madoff's feeder funds, Bharara said.
            By October 2008, the bank was so concerned about Madoff's
            returns that it redeemed $275 million it had in the funds, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, the bank learned Madoff and a client of
            JPMorgan's Private Bank were engaged in questionable banking
            processes known as 'round-trip transactions' that amounted to
            what Bharara said was a 'check-kiting scheme.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Closed Account &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These transactions were so questionable that another U.S.
            bank involved in the transactions filed a suspicious activity
            report and closed Madoff's account, Bharara said. JPMorgan
            allowed the transactions to continue for close to a decade, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It took until after the arrest of Madoff, one of the
            worst crooks this office has ever seen, for JPMorgan to alert
            authorities to what the world already knew,' George Venizelos,
            the FBI assistant director in charge, said in a statement today.
            'We all need to be invested in making our markets safer and
            more equitable. The FBI can't do it alone. Traders, compliance
            officers, analysts, bankers, and executives are the gatekeepers
            of the financial industry. We need their help protecting our
            markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara said today his office plans for 'every penny' of
            the $1.7 billion to go to 'help make Bernie Madoff's victims
            closer to whole.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to pay
            $1.7 billion to settle U.S. claims that it facilitated Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the largest in U.S.
            history, resolving
            yet another legal obstacle facing the embattled bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, entered
            into a deferred-prosecution agreement with Manhattan U.S.
            Attorney Preet Bharara, acknowledging oversight lapses related
            to an account Madoff used to fund his multibillion-dollar fraud.
            Separately, the bank agreed to pay $543 million to resolve
            private claims over losses tied to the scheme, according to a
            person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the 'largest ever bank
            forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice

            practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank still faces criminal inquiries into its energy
            trading practices, which were subject to a $410 million civil
            settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in
            July. Along with other banks, the firm also faces a probe into
            the possible manipulation of interest rates and currency
            benchmarks in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

            it owns, said two people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The refinancing, planned to be about 300 million pounds

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) are
            among banks that received federal requests for information about
            trades in mortgage-backed securities after the financial crisis,
            two people briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigation is in early stages, said the people, who
            asked not to be named because the inquiries were confidential.
            JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, disclosed the probe
            in an August filing, saying it received subpoenas and requests
            for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
            special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program
            and the U.S. Attorney's office in Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest global banks lost billions of dollars on
            mortgage-backed debt during the financial crisis as U.S. home
            prices plunged and the market for such assets dried up. While
            the securities rebounded after the crisis, markets remained
            illiquid with wide spreads between bids from buyers and sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley (MS) and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
            are also under scrutiny in the probe, the Wall Street Journal
            reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Zurich-based UBS,

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys South Korean Stocks Saying Concern Overdone</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management has been
            buying South Korean electronics and auto stocks in recent weeks,
            saying concern that the won's strength will erode exports is
            overblown after valuations fell to eight-year lows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been adding into weakness,' Grace Tam, a Hong
            Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset, which
            oversees about $1.5 trillion, said by phone yesterday. She
            declined to name specific stocks. 'People worry about the
            competitiveness of Korean exports. We think this is overdone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Kospi index has dropped 4.9 percent from last year's
            high on Oct. 30 as the won strengthened 5.9 percent against the
            yen. The benchmark index's valuation fell to about the same
            level as its companies' net assets last week, a 50 percent
            discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index, the widest gap
            since July 2005. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world's biggest
            maker of handsets and televisions, has slumped 14 percent while
            Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (000270), South Korea's largest
            automakers, fell at least 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the
            nation's benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point
            as early as tomorrow to mitigate the won's gains and spur
            growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Hyundai Motor and
            Kia Motors predicted the slowest growth in combined deliveries
            since 2006 on Jan. 2, while Samsung Electronics posted its first
            profit decline in nine quarters yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;International investors sold a net $2.2 billion of Kospi
            shares since the end of October, snapping a record stretch of
            inflows into Asia's fourth-largest economy. The Kospi fell less
            than 0.1 percent to 1,958.96 at the close today. Samsung
            Electronics slipped 1 percent, while Hyundai Motor climbed 0.2
            percent. The two stocks comprise more than 20 percent of the
            Kospi's weighting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks trailed developed-nation equities by
            the most since 1998 last year, leaving the MSCI Emerging Markets
            Index at the biggest valuation discount since 2004. The
            developing-nation gauge trades for 1.5 times net assets, or
            about 31 percent below the multiple on the MSCI World Index,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Improving growth in advanced economies including the U.S.
            will give South Korean exporters a boost in coming months, Tam
            said. The International Monetary Fund plans to raise its global
            growth forecast in coming weeks, Christine Lagarde, the fund's
            managing director, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Korean market is still very cheap,' Tam said.
            'Recent declines gave us good entry points.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Madoff Prosecution Case Deferred by Judge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. prosecution of JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) was deferred by a federal judge after the bank
            agreed to pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil
            allegations it failed to stop Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan's general counsel, pleaded not
            guilty today on behalf of the bank to two violations of the Bank
            Secrecy Act in connection with Madoff at an arraignment before
            U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel. The judge deferred
            prosecution of the case until January 2016, when the case will
            be dismissed if the bank complies with the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The required judicial intervention to protect the
            integrity of the process is not necessary,' Castel ruled. He
            set the next hearing for Jan. 15, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
            prosecution by entering into an accord with the office of
            Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that acknowledged
            oversight lapses related to a JPMorgan account Madoff used to
            fund his fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion to settle the U.S.
            allegations and $350 million in a related case by the Office of
            the Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover
            separate private claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Reports &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara said yesterday that the criminal charges will be
            dismissed after two years if JPMorgan complies with the
            agreement and implements reforms of its anti-money laundering
            compliance program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan had been Madoff's bank for decades and
            discovered questionable transactions as early as 1994, the New
            York-based bank didn't file any suspicious activity reports
            required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. JPMorgan
            acknowledged in the accord that it ignored red flags for about
            15 years that Madoff used his account to run a fraud, Bharara
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
            forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
            penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
            other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord brings its legal settlements from the past two
            years to more than $29 billion and further eroding its once-record earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The civil case is U.S. v. JPMorgan 14-CV-0063, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, will pay borrowers $2 billion in the form of mortgage
            relief and direct cash payments to settle home-loan abuse claims
            with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will make a cash payment of $753 million and set
            aside $1.2 billion toward foreclosure prevention efforts as part
            of an $8.5 billion deal with 10 banks and their regulators
            announced Jan. 7, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will take a $700 million pretax charge in the
            fourth quarter related to the settlement, according to the New
            York-based lender. It's scheduled to report earnings Jan. 16. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Largest Structured Note Tied to Gold Since 2010</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $35
            million of one-year notes linked to the price of gold, the
            bank's largest offering tied to the precious metal in at least
            three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Jan. 2, yield three times the gains
            of the price of gold in London up to 15.6 percent, with no
            protection against losses and all capital at risk, according to
            a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission. The metal's price increased 8.3 percent last year in
            London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank sold $82.4 million of notes tied to gold in eight
            offerings last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            New York-based JPMorgan issued $27.8 million of one-year
            securities on Oct. 26, the next-largest deal since 2010, when
            Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on U.S. structured
            notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
            declined to comment on the latest offering or future gold notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads 20% Rise in Global Securitization Sales Last Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Global securitization volumes jumped
            20 percent last year to $511.6 billion as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Co.
            widened its lead as the top underwriter, according to newsletter
            Asset-Backed Alert. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan managed the sales for $66.2 billion, or 12.9
            percent, of the total offerings of securities backed by assets
            such as home mortgages, auto debt and speculative-grade company
            loans, according to the newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's share grew from 10.1 percent in 2011 as the New
            York-based firm managed $39.9 billion in sales of asset-backed
            securities tied to U.S. consumer or corporate borrowing, a
            category that excludes mortgage debt and so-called
            collateralized debt obligations. Barclays Plc (BARC) and Bank of
            America Corp., the other top underwriters in that market,
            remained the second- and third-ranked global bookrunners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays handled 10 percent of the global total last year,
            up from 9.2 percent for the London-based bank, according to
            Asset-Backed Alert. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
            America's share climbed to 8.7 percent, from 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Worldwide securitization volumes are down from the record
            $2.57 trillion reached in 2006, a year before U.S. mortgage
            securities and CDOs began a collapse that would spark the worst
            financial crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Securitization fell to $330.6 billion in 2009, excluding
            bonds that were created outside the U.S. to be retained by the
            issuers and pledged as collateral for loans from central banks,
            according to Asset-Backed Alert. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The newsletter's securitization tallies exclude government-
            backed U.S. home-loan bonds and repackagings of that debt called
            agency collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed
            commercial paper and the derivative portions of certain issues. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Energy Regulatory
            Commission will appeal a court restriction on its access to
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) e-mail in a probe of market manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The energy regulator will challenge a magistrate judge's
            November order blocking a review of unredacted copies of 25 e-
            mails because they involve attorney communications, it said
            today in a filing in federal court in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC sued New York-based JPMorgan July 2 demanding the e-
            mails in an investigation of possible manipulation of power
            markets in California and the Midwest by J.P. Morgan Ventures
            Energy Corp. The agency opened the probe last year after
            complaints from California and Midwest grid operators who said
            JPMorgan's bidding practices were abusive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson said she agreed with
            JPMorgan's lawyers that the redacted portions are confidential
            communications. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, didn't
            immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the
            filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. J.P.
            Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., 12-mc-352, U.S. District Court,
            District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will become the
            latest big bank ordered by U.S. regulators to clean up its
            safeguards against money laundering, said a person briefed on
            the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banking regulators including the Office of the Comptroller
            of the Currency will soon order the largest U.S. bank to fix
            compliance flaws in its Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities, said
            the person, who declined to be identified because the talks
            aren't public. The order doesn't include monetary penalties and
            is similar to one issued to Citigroup Inc. (C) in April, the person
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, and Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to
            comment on the order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the 2008 credit crisis companies reduced compliance
            staff tasked with guarding the financial system against the flow
            of illicit money, banking regulators said. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
            Europe's largest bank, agreed last month to pay $1.9 billion to
            settle a money-laundering probe by the U.S. Department of
            Justice and banking regulators in the U.S. and U.K. Another
            London-based bank, Standard Chartered Plc, was fined a total of
            $667 million by U.S. regulators last year for facilitating
            transactions with Iran in violation of sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a separate OCC probe, Treasury Department Inspector
            General Eric Thorson threatened to sanction the bank if it fails
            to turn over documents to regulators investigating its ties to
            Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, giving JPMorgan a deadline of
            today to cooperate with the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OCC is also investigating the 2012 trading losses in
            JPMorgan's chief investment office and is preparing an
            enforcement action, according to another person briefed on the
            situation who asked not to be named because the matter isn't
            public. The cease-and-desist order would require the bank to fix
            internal risk controls, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blavatnik Takes JPMorgan to Trial for Subprime Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) filled a fund started by billionaire Leonard Blavatnik with risky mortgage
            securities instead of the conservative investments it was told to make, lawyers for Blavatnik told a New
            York state judge today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, sued New York-based JPMorgan in New York state
            Supreme Court in June 2009, accusing the biggest U.S. bank by assets of putting more money into mortgage
            securities than his investment guidelines allowed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CMMF fund was started by
            Blavatnik's Access Industries in 2006 as a 'short-term, highly liquid and very conservative cash management
            account,' according to court filings. JPMorgan 'stuffed' the account with risky mortgage securities, turning
            it into something it was never meant to be, said Richard I. Werder Jr., an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
            Urquhart Sullivan LLP, which is representing the fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This was not supposed to be a
            high-risk, swing-for-the- fences investment,' Werder told state Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer at
            the start of a non-jury trial over Blavatnik's lawsuit that began in Manhattan today. 'This was supposed to
            be the opposite: conservative and safe.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan should be held responsible for the
            loss, Blavatnik, who is ranked 47th in Bloomberg's billionaires index with a net worth of $15.3 billion,
            said in his lawsuit, because it loaded his Access Industries fund with subprime and Alt-A mortgages while
            Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such securities from the bank's books. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Sucker's
            Bet' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This was a sucker's bet,' Werder said in a pretrial brief. 'If it paid off, CMMF
            would merely recoup its principal. By making this massive bet -- which was completely unnecessary to achieve
            the account's conservative objectives -- JPM breached the parties' agreement, acted negligently and caused
            enormous and avoidable losses of approximately $100 million.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The securities being
            challenged by CMMF had 'extraordinary protection' against 'all but the most catastrophic losses,' hadn't
            defaulted while the bank managed the account and were AAA-rated when purchased, Lewis R. Clayton of Paul
            Weiss Rifkind Wharton Garrison LLP, which is representing JPMorgan, told Schweitzer during opening arguments
            today. The securities had no downgrades until March 2008, Clayton said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Were Safe'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The market believed these securities were safe,' Clayton said. 'Their own investment
            advisers believed these investments were safe.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has argued that CMMF rejected
            the 'most conservative strategy' it was offered in favor of one that sought a higher return than a
            money-market fund, with higher risk and less liquidity, Clayton said in a pretrial memorandum. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The account performed well until the fall of 2007, when events in the mortgage markets and the
            economy 'began to have a negative impact,' Clayton wrote in the memorandum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            Investment Management believed that prices for the asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
            obligations in the account were depressed because of 'short-term liquidity problems, not because of a
            realistic risk of loss of principal,' and thought CMMF should hold the investments for the long term and not
            take losses at 'artificially depressed prices,' according to Clayton's memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;View
            'Shared' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This view was shared by CMMF's independent adviser, Nancy Zimmerman, a
            sophisticated financial professional who manages a multibillion-dollar hedge fund,' Clayton said in the
            pretrial memo. 'CMMF also repeatedly made clear that it did not want to realize losses and objected
            vociferously when JPMIM sold one investment at a loss of approximately 5 percent.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            account generated a net gain of almost $4 million until CMMF closed it in May 2008 and gave the securities
            to Zimmerman to manage, Clayton said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial is set to last as long as
            two weeks. Blavatnik isn't scheduled to testify, according to a list of witnesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Ordered to Fix Controls, Pay Practices After Whale Bet</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was ordered by U.S. regulators to strengthen risk controls and enhance
            executive compensation practices after losing more than $6.2 billion on a wrong-way derivatives bet last
            year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve found deficiencies in JPMorgan's risk controls, loss modeling
            and audit functions as well as the process for alerting the board of directors to problems. The central bank
            and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both issued cease-and-desist orders yesterday requiring
            JPMorgan to tighten its trading oversight, particularly in the chief investment office, and separate orders
            to bolster systems preventing clients from laundering money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The orders show there are
            'significant control weaknesses beyond the CIO's office that raises questions about whether JPMorgan is that
            much better than its peers at risk management,' said Josh Rosner, an analyst at New York-based Graham Fisher
            Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are the first regulatory sanctions against JPMorgan in response to the botched
            trades, which Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in May stemmed from 'egregious' lapses. Bruno
            Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were big enough to move markets,
            made the wrong- way bet on credit derivatives that fueled the losses. As much as $51 billion in shareholder
            value had been erased at one point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sanctions are relatively light, allowing
            JPMorgan to avoid fines, Rosner said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.K. Probe &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other U.S.
            agencies investigating the trading loss include the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of
            Investigation. The U.K.'s Financial Services Authority said yesterday that it's undertaking a formal
            enforcement probe, which typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of financial rule
            violations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Conclusions will be reached in the enforcement investigation in due course
            and any further appropriate action determined at that time,' the FSA said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Fed gave JPMorgan's board 60 days to submit a plan to enhance oversight of risk-management, internal-audit
            and finance functions. The panel also must overhaul its system for compensating top executives, accounting
            for 'adverse risk outcomes and control deficiencies,' according to a Fed order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Internal
            Report &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank's board is considering releasing an internal report that faults Dimon's
            oversight of the CIO when the company announces fourth-quarter results tomorrow, two people with direct
            knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That report, which builds on a preliminary analysis
            released in July, is critical of senior managers including Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug
            Braunstein, 52, and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately supervising traders in the
            U.K., according to the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report will be presented to the board when it meets
            today. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            didn't admit or deny wrongdoing in consenting to the regulatory orders issued yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We've
            been working hard to fully remediate the issues identified in the consent order' on the trading losses, Joe
            Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An OCC order found that the bank
            also 'has an inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing' for anti- money-laundering
            compliance. The company 'failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity' and to file required
            reports alerting regulators, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meeting those 'responsibilities --
            and going above and beyond -- is a top priority for us,' Evangelisti said. 'We have already made progress
            addressing the issues cited in the consent orders, which contain no allegations of intentional misconduct by
            the firm or any of its employees.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>FSA Probes JPMogran Over London Whale Trading Losses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;An investigation of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was opened by the U.K.'s finance regulator as to
            whether traders in London broke any rules related to wrong-way bets on credit derivatives that lost their
            unit $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority said yesterday in an e- mailed
            statement that it's probing the losses suffered by JPMorgan in the chief investment office, or CIO, at the
            firm's London offices. Other agencies already investigating the matter include the U.S. Justice Department
            and Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the
            London Whale because he was responsible for a trading book large enough to move the market, made a wrong-way
            bet on credit derivatives that led to the company's biggest trading loss. At one point, as much as $51
            billion in shareholder value was erased by the trades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The FSA is continuing to conduct
            a formal enforcement investigation into the trading losses,' the regulator said in the statement.
            'Conclusions will be reached in the enforcement investigation in due course and any further appropriate
            action determined at that time.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan was ordered by U.S. regulators
            to strengthen risk and auditing controls. The firm also promised to bolster systems to prevent money
            laundering. After reviewing the unit that suffered the losses, the Federal Reserve faulted JPMorgan's
            management and modeling of risks, as well as its auditing functions and the process for communicating
            problems to the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Central Bank &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank
            and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both issued cease-and-desist orders focusing on the CIO as
            well as broader anti-money-laundering controls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the FSA, a move to a formal
            enforcement proceeding typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of financial rule
            violations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank's board is considering releasing this week an internal report that
            faults Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon's oversight of the division, two people familiar with the matter
            have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final report, which builds on a preliminary analysis released in July, is
            critical of senior managers including Dimon, 56, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51, and

            an illiquid position in credit derivatives last year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender's
            analysis in July said that London traders may have intentionally mismarked some of their positions and
            sought to hide the full amount of their losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan didn't admit or deny wrongdoing
            in consenting to regulatory orders issued yesterday, and no fines were imposed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Seen Facing U.S., U.K. Actions on Whale Trades</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is set to face
            new actions from U.S. and U.K. bank regulators as early as today
            for botched trades that cost the company more than $6.2 billion
            last year, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
            Federal Reserve, which have been investigating the loss, may
            release some of their findings today, three people familiar with
            the matter said. The U.K.'s Financial Services Authority, which
            has also been informally looking into whether traders
            intentionally mismarked some of their positions and tried to
            cover up their losses, may open an official investigation,
            according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators have yet to punish New York-based JPMorgan, the
            biggest U.S. bank, for lapses in risk oversight that Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has called 'egregious.' It
            isn't clear whether the Fed and OCC's announcement will also
            include sanctions, according to the people, who asked not to be
            named because the matter hasn't been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OCC is preparing a cease-and-desist order requiring New
            York-based JPMorgan to fix internal controls that contributed to
            its wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, a person familiar with
            the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The chief investment office within JPMorgan's national bank
            suffered from 'inadequate risk management,' Comptroller of the
            Currency Thomas Curry said during U.S. Senate testimony in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Potential Gaps' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been focusing on potential gaps or deviations
            from accepted standards of risk management within that
            particular office and looking to see whether similar gaps exist
            in any other area,' Curry said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move to a formal enforcement proceeding by the FSA
            typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of
            financial rule violations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman at JPMorgan, Robert Garsson at
            the OCC, Barbara Hagenbaugh at the Federal Reserve and
            Christopher Hamilton at the FSA all declined to comment on the
            regulatory actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's board of directors is also considering releasing
            an internal report that faults Dimon's oversight of the division
            when the company announces fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 16,
            two people with direct knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Braunstein, Drew &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The final report, which builds on a preliminary analysis
            released in July, is critical of senior managers including
            Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51,
            and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately
            supervising traders in the U.K. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The report will be presented to the board when it meets
            tomorrow. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it
            when the bank announces fourth-quarter results the following
            day, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
            report isn't yet public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s quarterly profit fell 7.3 percent on $2.6 billion of settlements tied to
            Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme as rising legal costs ended the firm's three-year streak of record annual
            earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income declined to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 a share, from
            $5.69 billion, or $1.39, a year earlier, according to a statement today from New York-based JPMorgan, the
            biggest U.S. bank. Results excluding the Madoff settlement and other one-time items were $1.40 a share.
            Twenty-two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $1.37 on average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is whittling down the firm's list of legal woes that include allegations it misled
            buyers of mortgage bonds, rigged markets and turned a blind eye to suspicious activity by customers. The
            Madoff agreement, which the bank said last week reduced fourth-quarter profit by about $850 million, capped
            a year in which JPMorgan spent more than $23 billion on legal settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and
            investment bank allocated 4.2 percent less for employee
            compensation last year as the division's revenue was little
            changed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $10.8 billion in compensation fell to 30 percent
            of revenue, excluding accounting adjustments, from 32 percent in
            2012, according to figures posted today on the New York-based
            firm's website. The amount equals $207,368 for each of the
            division's 52,250 employees. The unit employed 52,022 people a
            year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has struggled to
            meet expense goals amid surging litigation costs and efforts to
            improve compliance. The company wouldn't penalize employees for
            losses tied to bad loans sold by firms it acquired amid the
            financial crisis, including Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington
            Mutual Inc.'s banking operations, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's hard to look at JPMorgan and say you're going to
            blame people at JPMorgan, the existing employees, for what
            happened with Bear Stearns and WaMu,' said Dimon, 57. 'We've
            never blamed employees broadly for mistakes we made away from
            them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Compensation at the corporate and investment bank, run by
            Mike Cavanagh, 48, and Daniel Pinto, 51, includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
            years. Figures for average pay don't represent what individuals
            actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

            and more information than previously thought. Payments information was also compromised at Neiman Marcus

            to protect yourself.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stores and banks need to cooperate to prevent information from

        <headline>U.S. in Talks on Global Services Trade Sought by JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. will participate in global
            talks to lower barriers on trade of financial services and
            telecommunications, a step toward a deal sought by companies
            including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and ATT Inc. (T) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Negotiations will include 20 trading partners, including
            the European Union, at the World Trade Organization in Geneva,
            U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said today in a letter to
            congressional leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Every $1 billion in U.S. services exports supports an
            estimated 4,200 U.S. jobs in America,' Kirk wrote to House
            Speaker John Boehner and Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy. The negotiations will begin within 90
            days, Kirk said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Services such as express package delivery, insurance,
            telecommunications and electronic payments are becoming a
            growing part of global trade, estimated by the WTO at about $8
            trillion in 2011. U.S. exports of private services were worth
            about $600 billion in 2011, according to Kirk's office. The U.S.
            had a $178.5 billion surplus in services trade that year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nations working toward an agreement represent about 70
            percent of the world's trade in services, according to the
            Coalition of Service Industries, a Washington-based group whose
            members include JPMorgan, ATT, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), FedEx Corp. (FDX) and
            Aflac Inc. (AFL) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Engine &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased that the United States is ready to fight
            for new trade rules to enable the services sector to achieve its
            potential as the engine of our economy,' Peter Allgeier, a
            former U.S. ambassador to the WTO and president of the services
            group, said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Industry groups including the Washington-based U.S. Chamber
            of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, whose members include
            the heads of companies including Bank of America Corp., Visa
            Inc. (V) and Verizon Communications Inc., cheered the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a chance to tackle emerging trade barriers in
            areas such as the digital economy while strengthening the global
            rules-based trading system,' Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's
            senior vice president for international affairs, said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican and head of
            the Ways and Means Committee that oversees trade legislation,
            said the services agreement is a 'critical trade policy' that
            will help create U.S. jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;WTO Members &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am impressed with the group of 21 WTO members thus far
            that plan to join the negotiations, representing dymanic
            devleoping and developed markets for U.S. exports,' Camp said
            in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nations in the talks are Australia, Canada, Chile, Taiwan,
            Colombia, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea,
            Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Switzerland
            and Turkey. The EU represents 27 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil, China and India have declined to join, saying the
            efforts may impede broader global trade talks that have been
            stalled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Discussions probably will cover the cross-border movement
            of financial data, information and communications services,
            maritime, environmental and energy services and government
            procurement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan With Wells Fargo Lose Share to Small Rivals: Mortgages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The two largest U.S. home lenders
            are feeling the bite of competition from smaller firms as
            mortgage originations tumble at the fastest rate since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New loans at Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the biggest, fell 38
            percent to $50 billion in the fourth quarter from the third
            quarter, the bank said in a statement yesterday. At JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) originations decreased 42 percent to $23.3 billion,
            outpacing the 27 percent fourth-quarter drop forecast by the
            Mortgage Bankers Association for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Big banks are facing dual challenges of increased
            competition and a plunge in home loan refinancing after the
            Federal Reserve said it planned to reduce monthly bond purchases
            and sent mortgage rates soaring. Smaller lenders are helped
            because the market is shifting to one led by mortgages for home
            purchases, favoring firms that can capture the buyers'
            attention, said Clifford Rossi, a former Citigroup Inc. (C) risk
            manager who now teaches at the University of Maryland's Robert
            H. Smith School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot of these guys are using the internet and social
            media platforms to reach borrowers more directly,' Rossi said.
            Due to their 'ability to be more nimble and opportunistic in
            the marketplace, you will see more companies like that be able
            to do more.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Reports 53% Earnings Increase as Mortgage Fees Rise</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, said fourth-quarter profit rose 53
            percent, beating analysts' estimates as mortgage revenue more than doubled and the lender set aside less for
            future losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $5.69 billion, or $1.39 a share, from $3.73
            billion, or 90 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. JPMorgan earned
            $1.35 a share excluding one-time items such as accounting adjustments and costs from a mortgage settlement,
            compared with the $1.22 estimate for adjusted earnings by 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            firm's results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for the fourth
            quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth,' Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56,
            said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan capped its third-straight year of record profits with
            $21.3 billion in net income, even after suffering its biggest trading loss ever. The bank faces regulatory
            sanctions and investigations by U.S. and international authorities stemming from the loss over a wrong-way
            bet on credit derivatives. The mistake cost JPMorgan more than $6.2 billion in the first nine months of last
            year, and the board cut Dimon's 2012 pay in half as a result. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Corporate and Investment Bank Pay Pool Falls 3% in 2012</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and investment bank cut employee compensation costs 3 percent
            in 2012 to $11.3 billion as the division generated 1 percent more revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expense
            was enough to give each of the division's 52,151 employees $216,928, according to figures posted today on
            the New York-based company's website. In 2011, the unit set aside $11.7 billion to pay traders, dealmakers
            and other personnel, or $217,600 for each of the 53,557 people on staff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            combined its investment bank with the firm's corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last
            year, and placed Mike Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto in charge of the division. The fourth quarter was the first
            that the bank reported the combined results of the entire group, which has more than double the employees
            than the investment bank alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pay costs for the year were 33 percent of revenue at the
            corporate and investment bank, down from 34 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for
            compensation includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous years. Figures
            for average pay don't represent what individuals actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Whale Report Spreads Blame as Dimon's Pay Halved</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), detailing lapses behind its biggest-ever trading loss, said employees
            were overwhelmed by the complexity of their bets, risk managers were ill-equipped and leaders including
            Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon weren't aggressive enough in responding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a
            129-page report issued yesterday, the bank described an 'error prone' risk-modeling system that required
            employees to cut and paste electronic data to a spreadsheet. Workers inadvertently used the sum of two
            numbers instead of the average in calculating volatility. The firm also reiterated an assertion that London
            traders initially tried to hide losses that ballooned beyond $6.2 billion in last year's first nine months.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investigation, overseen by Dimon confidante Mike Cavanagh, is part of an effort to
            overhaul the bank and rebuild investor trust after the trading debacle helped cut shareholder value by as
            much as $51 billion last year. The report doesn't explain why the chief investment office, a unit
            responsible for managing cash and mitigating risk, departed from more conservative strategies, eventually
            amassing a portfolio of complex credit derivatives. Dimon's pay for last year was cut in half following the
            losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The people who conduct these internal investigations walk a fine line,' said
            David Felt, a lawyer with Arnall Golden Gregory in Washington. 'Their job is to find out what happened and
            prevent it from reoccurring, but not to provide evidence to prosecutors and other litigators.' Felt, who
            specializes in corporate inquiries, helped oversee the regulatory investigations into accounting fraud at
            Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac for the Federal Housing Finance Agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;London Whale
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan first disclosed losses on the trades in May, almost a month after Dimon
            dismissed initial news reports on the bets as a 'tempest in a teapot.' Transactions were handled by
            London-based trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were so big. Dimon, 56,
            said yesterday the bank is almost done with losses in the CIO and won't disclose the size of future
            declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board of directors cut the CEO's compensation for 2012 to $11.5 million.
            The decision was announced as the firm reported a 53 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit to $5.69 billion,
            driven by earnings on mortgages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the
            failures that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility,' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh,
            who has worked with or for Dimon since 1993, led the management task force that produced the report. Dimon
            promoted him from chief financial officer to run the treasury and security services division in June 2010,
            and again last July to co-head the corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'More Independent'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I would have much rather seen a more-independent report,' said Paul Miller, an analyst
            at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. 'Let's say that Cavanagh is a straight-up, straight-shooting
            guy who's going to do this effectively. Nobody is going to believe it.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti,
            a spokesman for the bank, said Cavanagh answered to the independent committee of the board, which also
            conducted its own review. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The loss at JPMorgan, considered one of the industry's
            best-managed firms after remaining profitable during the credit crisis, has prompted lawsuits and probes in
            the U.S. and abroad. This week, it led to the first regulatory sanctions, as banking watchdogs found
            internal-control 'deficiencies.' It also has pushed lawmakers to tighten trading curbs included in the 2010
            Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Too Trusting &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CIO unit used credit derivatives
            as part of a hedging strategy, and the trades became so large the bank couldn't easily unwind them. The
            report blamed managers, many of whom were reassigned or left last year, for roles in failing to halt the
            loss. The executives include former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, Barry Zubrow, ex-head of companywide
            risk management, and former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read the full
            JPMorgan Chase Co. report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon was faulted for trusting information given him by senior
            managers, according to the task force. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He could have better tested his reliance on what
            he was told,' the firm found. 'More should have been done regarding the risks, risk controls and personnel
            associated with CIO's activities, and Mr. Dimon bears some responsibility.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, who
            is also chairman of the board, wasn't included in deliberations on his compensation, he told reporters on a
            conference call. The bank said its decisions took into account his replacement of senior managers, efforts
            to claw back their pay and the formation of a team to examine what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Embarrassing
            Mistake' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Once Mr. Dimon became aware of the seriousness of the issues presented by
            CIO, he responded forcefully by directing a thorough review and an extensive program of remediation,' the
            company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The board had to look at the positives, which I think are large, and the
            negatives,' Dimon said. 'This is one huge embarrassing mistake and I respect their decision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Executives failed to ensure that the CIO's risk controls kept pace with the increased complexity of
            the unit's activities, the task force said. The leaders didn't verify that the unit was well managed or had
            the same level of risk controls as elsewhere at the firm, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Significant
            risk-management weaknesses developed within CIO that allowed the traders to pursue their flawed and risky
            trading strategies,' the bank said. 'Senior firm management's view of CIO had not evolved to reflect the
            increasingly complex and risky strategies CIO was pursuing.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Traders Ousted &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon ousted three London traders involved in the loss, shuffled senior managers and accepted
            resignations from executives including Drew. Matt Zames, the former co-head of fixed-income trading, was
            promoted twice last year and, after helping overhaul the CIO, is now co-chief operating officer with Frank
            Bisignano. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew retired four days after the loss was disclosed May 10. Iksil, his
            supervisor Javier Martin-Artajo and the former CIO head in Europe, Achilles Macris, also left. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zubrow, who had overseen JPMorgan's risk-management function while Iksil expanded his book, retired
            at the end of last year. Braunstein, 52, stepped down to become a vice chairman in the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the years before the trading losses, Dimon had pushed the CIO to generate more profit by
            boosting the size and risk of its bets to include higher-yielding assets, Bloomberg News reported in April,
            citing former executives. The shift had made the unit an increasingly important customer to Wall Street's
            trading desks, with bets that could move markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Probe's Focus &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            task force wrote in a footnote to its report that while it had reviewed 'certain background information' on
            how the CIO expanded into credit derivatives, its focus 'was on the events at the end of 2011 and the first
            several months of 2012 when the losses occurred.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also highlighted blunders
            tied to measuring risk. Dimon had previously said switching models understated the chance of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CIO exceeded its so-called value-at-risk limit 'at several points' during a period in January
            2012, driven by the synthetic credit portfolio, JPMorgan said in the report. The office recommended a
            temporary increase in the risk limit, as the new model was expected to show a 'substantially' reduced
            measure of the amount in danger of being lost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 23, a trader e-mailed the person
            who developed the new model to say he should 'keep the pressure on our friends in model validation and
            [quantitative research],' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flaws Overlooked &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There
            is some evidence the Model Review Group accelerated its review as a result of this pressure, and in so doing
            it may have been more willing to overlook the operational flaws apparent during the approval process,'
            according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk model was developed by a London-based quantitative
            expert who had not previously created or implemented such a model and wasn't given the support he requested,
            JPMorgan said. The firm's review of the model wasn't 'as rigorous as it should have been,' JPMorgan said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also found the spreadsheet used the sum of two numbers, rather than their
            average, as part of a risk calculation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This error likely had the effect of muting
            volatility by a factor of two,' according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve and Office
            of the Comptroller of the Currency on Jan. 14 took the first regulatory actions stemming from the trade,
            ordering the bank to strengthen risk and auditing controls. The board of directors also was told to consider
            control weaknesses and 'adverse risk outcomes' while awarding compensation for Dimon and other top managers.

        <headline>JPMorgan Lowers Buyback Request to Less Than $12 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, reduced its 2013 stock-repurchase request with
            federal bank regulators by at least 20 percent after suffering
            its biggest trading loss ever last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan asked the Federal Reserve if it could buy back
            less than $3 billion per quarter when it submitted its annual
            capital request in January, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
            56, told analysts on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed forced the New York-based company to suspend a $15
            billion stock-buyback program last year after the bank in May
            acknowledged losses in a credit-derivatives portfolio that
            eventually swelled to more than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan's board
            of directors cut Dimon's pay for 2012 in half after a review of
            the losses in the chief investment office held him responsible
            for the botched trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had repurchased $1.6 billion of the $15 billion in
            authorized share buybacks when the Fed suspended the program.
            The central bank later approved the repurchase of $3 billion in
            additional shares in the first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of
            the original buyback goal unused. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon said he is inclined to buy back shares when the price
            of the stock falls below tangible book value. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Mining Loan Rebound Amid Price Slump: Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is leading a
            rebound in bank lending to mining and energy companies, which
            are taking out the most loans since 2011 to refinance debt as
            commodity prices slump and acquisitions slow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw-material industries boosted borrowing by 17 percent
            last year to $684.7 billion, after a 22 percent drop in 2012,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. The top lenders were U.S. banks
            JPMorgan at $57.1 billion, Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) at $47.1 billion
            and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) at $37.8 billion. The figures reflect
            transactions involving more than one bank and include credit
            lines, project or term loans and trade finance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While increased scrutiny from regulators is prompting
            JPMorgan and other banks to exit physical commodity businesses
            such as warehouses and power plants, lending rose as companies
            including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc refinanced
            to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Tumbling metal prices
            also eroded revenue at mines and smelters last year during the
            first commodity slump since the recession of 2008, while the
            value of mergers and acquisitions slid 31 percent, data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was generally not a good year for commodities in 2013,
            and that required companies to raise external financing,' said
            Larry Landry, vice chairman of investment banking for JPMorgan
            in New York. 'There will be less opportunistic-driven
            refinancing in 2014, but hopefully that will be offset by a
            meaningful pickup in mergers and acquisitions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BofA Overtakes JPMorgan for Investment-Banking Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. lender, took in more investment-banking fees than
            larger rival JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) for the first time since acquiring Merrill Lynch Co. during the
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fees for debt and equity issuance, as well as advice for activities
            including mergers, rose 17 percent to $6.41 billion last year at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
            America. That edged out New York-based JPMorgan's $6.33 billion in such revenue for the first time since
            2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America's investment-banking operations, run by Christian Meissner and
            overseen by Chief Operating Officer Thomas Montag, benefited from a record year in debt underwriting as
            corporations took advantage of all-time low rates for junk bonds ahead of Federal Reserve plans to withdraw
            stimulus. The question is whether the firm's business can maintain its top rank when rates rise, said
            Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'It's not even close to sustainable,' Peabody said in a telephone interview of the jump in fees
            from debt. 'It wouldn't shock me if fixed-income revenues, issuance and trading, were down 20 percent in
            2014. Over the course of the year, rising rates will become a dislocative factor that will cut that pipeline
            at some point.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Tops Banks for Third Year as Loans Retreat: Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) led lending to
            commodities companies for a third consecutive year even as
            global financing to the industry fell to the lowest since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets arranged $44.1 billion of
            loans, giving the New York-based company a 7.8 percent market
            share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America
            Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) came next. Three Canadian banks were in
            the top 10, from one a year ago, as European lenders retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loans fell 23 percent to $568 billion last year after
            mergers and acquisitions diminished to the lowest annual total
            since 2010. Deals accelerated in the fourth quarter to the
            highest in five years, including OAO Rosneft's $55 billion
            purchase of oil producer TNK-BP, as economic growth improved.
            Stock markets are rising for a third consecutive month after
            U.S. lawmakers reached a budget agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Since there hasn't been much MA for the past couple of
            years, there is some pent-up demand,' said Thomas Cassin, co-
            head of investment-grade finance at JPMorgan in New York.
            'Having more clarity around the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling
            and just the direction of the economy in general will bring to
            bear a bit more confidence and willingness to go out and look at
            the MA.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Raw Materials &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities stagnated in 2012, with the Standard Poor's
            GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials rising 0.3 percent, the least in
            five years. The 140-member Bloomberg World Mining Index (BWMING) advanced
            2.9 percent, lagging behind the 13 percent gain in the MSCI All-
            Country World Index of equities. Natural-resource and energy
            companies announced $610 billion of mergers and acquisitions,
            8.3 percent less than in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
            arranged $30.8 billion of loans, and New York-based Citigroup
            $30.6 billion, giving them both a 5.4 percent market share.
            Combined lending by the top three banks fell 36 percent from a
            year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) overtook BNP Paribas SA (BNP) to take the
            fourth slot after buying $9.5 billion of the French bank's
            energy loans in February. The Paris-based lender retreated 10
            places in the rankings, as rival Societe Generale dropped to
            19th from 15th. The figures as of yesterday reflect transactions
            involving more than one bank and include credit lines, project
            or term loans and trade finance. Wells Fargo's total was $29.3
            billion in loans, for a 5.2 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Syndicated Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Declines in syndicated loans in the commodity and energy
            sector are consistent with trends in the broader market,' said
            Peter Hall, the global head of investment-grade loan syndicates
            at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. 'The next big wave
            of refinancing is due in two years, so 2014 and 2015 are going
            to be much busier.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average interest banks charge for loans to commodity
            companies has risen to 325 basis points more than benchmark
            lending rates, from 268 basis points in 2011, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Globally across all industries, banks charged 323.4 basis
            points above lending rates compared with 282.3 basis points in
            2011. Syndicated loans across industries declined 21 percent to
            $2.99 trillion in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Canadian Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada (RY), led
            the advance by Canadian banks last year, taking fifth place with
            $28.4 billion of loans, little changed from a year earlier. TD
            Securities Inc., part of Toronto Dominion Bank, arranged almost
            $19.9 billion for seventh place, and was one of only two in the
            top 10 to increase overall lending, along with Barclays Plc. (BARC)
            Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), based in Toronto, oversaw $16 billion of
            loans to take 10th place. Wells Fargo, Barclays, Nova Scotia and
            BNP Paribas declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Resource financing will go up this year,' said Burke Smyth, the co-head of Canadian credit
            origination at TD
            Securities in Toronto. 'There is nothing to prevent it from
            seeing an increase as commodity prices recover a bit, foreign
            companies start to look at Canada and the U.S. starts to grow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian banks have been ranked as the world's soundest for
            five consecutive years by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.
            They are also buying more assets, including Bank of Nova
            Scotia's agreement in August to purchase ING Groep NV's Canadian
            unit for C$3.1 billion ($3.15 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'banks are playing off the strength of their balance
            sheets and expertise that we have in metals and mining,' said
            Mark Chandler, the head of Canadian syndicated and leveraged
            finance at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Canada is home to
            Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX), the largest gold miner, and Potash Corp. of
            Saskatchewan Inc., the biggest fertilizer producer. Commodities
            are about half of Canada's exports, government figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mergers Data &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Natural-resource and energy companies announced $202.8
            billion of mergers and acquisitions in the fourth quarter,
            accounting for 33 percent of the annual total, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. Rosneft raised $16.8 billion in loans last month
            to finance the TNK-BP acquisition, to become the world's largest
            publicly-traded crude-oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loans to commodity companies in North America declined 24
            percent to $317.9 billion while those in Europe, Middle East and
            Africa tumbled 31 percent to $140.9 billion, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. There was an 8.7 percent drop in the Central
            Asia and Pacific Rim region to $92.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Key Event' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A key event in 2012 was the return to stability of
            funding to the commodity finance market, even if the overall
            financing market volumes are down due to the pullback in metals
            prices and slower global economic growth,' said Federico Turegano, the global head of natural resources and
            energy
            finance at Societe Generale in Paris. 'The big question for
            2013 will be how fast the Asian markets return to purchasing
            commodities, particularly China on the metals side.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China is the biggest consumer of everything from copper to
            cotton to coal and it probably returned to faster economic
            growth in the final three months of 2012, having slowed for
            seven consecutive quarters, the mean of 35 economist estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg show. Chinese banks probably will lend
            more this year, with a focus on financing the nation's commodity
            cargoes, said Simon Tyler, the head of corporate banking at
            China Construction Bank Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Chinese banks are starting to compete more in the
            loans space,' he said. 'This year there will be much more. We
            are expanding from a relatively low base, so we are not going to
            be a major player yet but we will be doing a lot more.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Any return of funding won't be fully reflected in
            syndicated loans, said Turegano of Societe Generale. 'A huge
            part of the commodity finance business is done on an uncommitted
            bilateral basis, therefore undisclosed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Higher Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lending may increase this year should commodity costs
            rebound. A Bloomberg survey of 131 analysts, traders and
            investors last month predicted higher prices across industrial
            and precious metals and agriculture. Brent crude will trade
            above $100 a barrel for a third consecutive year, according to
            the median of 30 estimates compiled in December. It traded at
            $111.09 a barrel today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The world needs commodities,' said David Basra, the head
            of debt financing for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at
            Citigroup in London. 'We have a growing global population, we
            have growth in the emerging markets and that all puts demand on
            natural resources. The requirement for liquidity and funding
            remains high.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Start Electronic Corporate Bond Trading System</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, plans to consolidate its electronic trading
            system for corporate bonds with other asset classes in the early
            part of this year as lenders seek to adapt to regulatory changes
            and reduce costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're trying to figure out how our customers would like
            to execute,' Scott Wacker, the London-based head of FX Sales
            EMEA at JPMorgan, said today in a telephone interview. 'Our
            target is the end of the first quarter, maybe into the second
            quarter that we intend to start to offer the ability to execute
            online for fixed-income products.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the most-active underwriter of dollar-denominated
            debt, is beginning the effort as Wall Street's biggest banks
            have pared their corporate-bond inventories by 76 percent since
            the 2007 peak with new risk-curbing regulations forcing them to
            reduce their roles as market makers. Firms are capitulating to
            the growing use of electronic systems to broker bonds that
            traditionally were bought and sold over the counter with traders
            as middlemen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clients are already using the web-based platform, JP Morgan
            Markets, for purposes including trading currencies and commodity
            futures and accessing research, according to Wacker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank by
            assets, announced the start of an electronic bond-trading
            service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. spent a year developing an
            electronic trading system for corporate bonds called GSessions
            that started operating in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The profitability of Wall Street firms is being challenged
            by regulations requiring that they hold more capital as a buffer
            against potential losses from assets such as corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holdings of company debt at the 21 primary dealers that
            trade with the Federal Reserve shrank 74 percent to $56.4
            billion as of Jan. 9 from the end of 2007, according to the
            Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Bond Reduces Whale to Teapot Tempest: Corporate Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $6.2 billion
            trading loss last year is little more than a fading memory for
            bondholders who awarded the lender its cheapest U.S. borrowing
            costs ever at a debt sale yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank by assets sold $6 billion of
            securities, including $2.75 billion of 10-year notes with an
            unprecedented 3.2 percent coupon, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demanded to hold those
            securities rather than government debt was 56 basis points
            tighter than where average comparable JPMorgan spreads traded
            before the scandal came to light in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's bond offering came a day after it reported a
            record profit for the third straight year even after posting the
            trading gaffe at the hands of an employee known as the London
            Whale. Aided by rising loan demand in a recovering economy, the
            New York-based bank boosted mortgage fees and related revenue
            almost threefold to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter. The
            trading losses are close to being a 'non-issue' Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Having the capacity to brush away a whale-sized problem
            and still be able to generate such significant earnings should
            make a bondholder sleep well at night,' Joel Levington,
            managing director of corporate credit for Brookfield Investment
            Management Inc. in New York, which manages $150 billion, said in
            an e-mail. The lender 'should generate north of $21 billion in
            profit annually for the next few years. That profile is highly
            unlikely to experience near-term default concerns.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Coupon &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's three-part debt sale was its biggest in the U.S.
            since the lender issued $7.2 billion of bonds in April 2011,
            Bloomberg data show. The bank sold $1.25 billion of five-year
            notes at its record low coupon of 1.8 percent to yield 103 basis
            points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $2 billion of
            five-year, floating-rate bonds at 90 basis points more than the
            London interbank offered rate. The 10-year portion had a spread
            of 133 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average spreads on 10-year, A rated JPMorgan bonds plunged
            to 140 basis points Jan. 16, down from 243 basis points on May
            18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data, a
            week after Fitch Ratings cut the bank's debt as a result of the
            trading loss. That compares with 189 basis points on March 26,
            before reports of the credit-derivative trades surfaced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Solid Position' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank earned $21.3 billion in net income last year on
            improving credit quality, according to Kathleen Shanley, a bond
            analyst at New York-based researcher Gimme Credit LLC. A
            provision for credit losses declined by more than half to $3.4
            billion from $7.6 billion in 2011, Shanley wrote yesterday in a
            report. It's the third straight year the lender has earned at
            least $15 billion in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They continue to be a very solid position for a lot of
            fixed-income investors,' Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond
            strategy at Susquehanna International Group LLP, said in a
            telephone interview from New York. 'They continue to perform
            extremely well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan first disclosed the trading losses on May 10,
            after Dimon initially dismissed concern as a 'tempest in a
            teapot' the month before. London-based trader Bruno Iksil, who
            worked in the chief investment office, built up positions in
            credit derivatives so large he was nicknamed the London Whale.
            The bank released a 129-page report Jan. 16 that blamed managers
            for roles in failing to halt the loss, as well as an 'error
            prone' risk-modeling system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's shares fell 9.3 percent May 11, the biggest drop
            in nine months, after JPMorgan estimated its trading losses at
            $2 billion. Fitch reduced the firm's long-term default rating to
            A+ from AA- the same day, following the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost to protect JPMorgan debt from losses for five
            years climbed 21 basis points to 132.5 basis points after the
            disclosure, Bloomberg prices show. Those credit-default swaps
            traded at 78.5 basis points at 11:26 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CDS prices typically fall when investor confidence improves
            and rise when it deteriorates. A basis point equals $1,000
            annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're five years on from the beginning of the financial
            crisis and investors have now recognized that many banks have
            increased their capital dramatically, non-performing loans have
            come down or their asset quality has improved dramatically,'
            Pinto said. 'They're much more comfortable investing today in
            bank paper.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender set aside $656 million in provisions against
            future mortgage loan losses, compared with an average estimate
            by analysts of about $1.5 billion, according to a Jan. 16
            earnings statement. Mortgage fees and related revenue increased
            to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter from $723 million a year
            earlier as the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent, indicating
            a strengthening economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gap between spreads on investment-grade bank bonds and
            the broader high-grade market reached the narrowest level in
            more than five years, when relative yields on bank debt dropped
            to 154 basis points, or 9 basis points more than corporates, on
            Jan. 7, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everything is driven by what the Fed is doing,' said Pri de Silva, a bank analyst at New
            York-based CreditSights Inc.,
            'Banks are opportunistically locking in the lower rates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve has held interest rates near
            record lows for an unprecedented fifth straight year, pushing
            investors to riskier assets in the search for yield. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The CIO fiasco blemished JPMorgan's previously stellar
            reputation as a savvy risk control manager,' wrote Gimme
            Credit's Shanley, who rates the bank's debt a buy. 'Jamie Dimon
            is no doubt glad to bid farewell to the year of the London
            Whale.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>ONO Is Said to Consider Picking JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Corporativo ONO SA is close to
            hiring banks for an initial public offering, according to two
            people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Spanish cable operator may pick Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) in the coming weeks for the IPO after
            inviting banks to bid for the work, the people said, asking not
            to be identified before a final decision is made. Madrid-based
            ONO held talks with investment banks in December and could sell
            shares this year if it decides to proceed, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The broadband provider could be valued at about 6.4 billion
            euros ($8.7 billion) in an IPO including debt, or 8.5 times its
            2012 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
            amortization, said Francisco Salvador, a Madrid-based strategist
            at FGA/MG Valores. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ONO's Ebitda in 2012 rose 0.5 percent to 752 million euros,
            a company statement showed. ONO had about 1.9 million
            residential customers and 118,000 small-office and home-office
            clients at the end of September. Its net debt at the time was
            3.3 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Apart from its big debt level, its main handicap is that
            the company hasn't been able to grow as fast as its peers while
            the broadband market in Spain is becoming more and more
            competitive,' Salvador said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Telefonica, Jazztel &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ONO's 11.125 percent bonds maturing in July 2019 rose 0.9
            cents on the euro this month to a record high 110.9 cents as of
            5 p.m. yesterday in Madrid, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Rosalia Portela said at an industry
            conference in the northern Spanish city of Santander in
            September that an IPO was 'a priority, our goal, and we expect
            to be able to carry it out in the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ONO has faced increasing price competition from rivals such
            as Telefonica SA (TEF), Spain's biggest phone company, and Jazztel
            Plc. The company's third-quarter Ebitda fell 9.3 percent from a
            year earlier to 172 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among ONO's shareholders, representatives for Thomas H. Lee
            Partners, Providence Equity Partners Inc. and CCMP Capital LLC
            didn't comment. Representatives for JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and
            ONO also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There has been speculation that ONO may be a takeover
            target for Newbury, England-based mobile-phone operator Vodafone
            Group Plc (VOD) as Europe's telecommunications industry undergoes a
            wave of mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Courboin France Head, Seillier EU FIG Chief</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, named Kyril Courboin head of France,
            replacing Isabelle Seillier, who is becoming head of the firm's
            financial institutions group for Europe, the Middle East and
            Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Courboin, who joined JPMorgan in 1990 and currently heads
            the financial institutions team in Europe, will report jointly
            to Emilio Saracho, deputy chief executive officer of EMEA, and
            Viswas Raghavan, head of banking for the region, according to an
            internal memorandum to employees. The contents of the document
            were confirmed by a spokeswoman for the lender today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seillier, who joined the firm in 1993 and has been in
            charge of France since 2008, will be responsible for covering
            banks and other clients in the financial-services industry in
            the region. She will report to Raghavan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm's
            corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last
            year, and named Raghavan head of banking for Europe as part of a
            revamp. Fourth-quarter revenue at the newly combined corporate
            and investment bank rose 21 percent to $7.6 billion, New York-
            based JPMorgan said last week, the first time it reported
            results of the entire group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Courboin's 'knowledge of the financial sector is second to
            none, and his international profile will help further develop
            our business in France,' Raghavan said. 'Isabelle has
            positioned JPMorgan as a top international bank in France, which
            will prove invaluable in her new regional role.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Courboin has worked on deals including Credit Agricole SA's
            2003 acquisition of Credit Lyonnais and the privatization of
            Credit Industriel et Commercial. Seillier served as head of
            investment banking activities for France from 2005 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Bridgepoint Advisers Ltd., a U.K.
            private-equity firm with more than $12 billion in committed
            funds, will choose JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to consider Swedish
            renal-care provider Diaverum's future. &lt;/p&gt;

            for the next 12 months, James Murray, a spokesman for the firm,
            said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diaverum provides renal care to more than 20,000 patients
            at about 250 clinics in 17 countries, including in South

        <headline>India Said to Shortlist Citi, JPMorgan for Axis Bank Stake Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. are among the banks shortlisted to help India sell part of
            its stake in Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB), four people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JM Financial Ltd. (JM) was also among the preferred investment
            banks that may be hired to manage the share sale of the
            country's third-largest private-sector lender by assets, said
            the people, asking not to be identified before a public
            announcement. The government will sell about half of its 20.7
            percent stake in the bank, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale valued at 57 billion rupees ($927 million) is part
            of India's efforts to narrow its budget gap and prevent a
            sovereign credit-rating downgrade to so-called junk status.
            Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government has raised 13 percent
            of the targeted 400 billion rupees it planned to raise by March
            31, according to the Disinvestment Department's data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will get a fee of one rupee for managing the
            issue while the expenses will be paid by the government, the
            people said. The share sale will probably happen before mid-February, two people said. Finance ministry
            spokesman D.S. Malik
            wasn't available for comment when called in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said in
            December the government is considering selling its stake in Axis
            Bank, which is held by the Specified Undertaking of the Unit
            Trust of India, or SUUTI, a state-run asset manager that also
            owns stakes in Larsen Toubro Ltd. and ITC Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government plans to sell its 171.9-billion rupee stake
            in billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd., according
            to Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. &lt;/p&gt;

            offering in Hong Kong amid a U.S. probe into hiring practices,
            two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank gave up the mandate as questions arose over
            Joyce Wei, a former employee, whose father is Tianhe Chemicals
            Chairman Qi Wei, the people said, asking not to be identified
            because the information is private. UBS AG (UBSN), which is also
            advising on the IPO, hired Wei toward the end of last year, two
            people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether New York-based
            JPMorgan hired people in Asia so that their relatives in
            government would steer business to the firm, people with
            knowledge with the investigations have said. Gaby Abdelnour,
            former head of the bank's Asia-Pacific business, was questioned
            by U.S. investigators about his knowledge of the hiring
            practices, a person briefed on the matter said last week.
            Abdelnour and the bank haven't been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investment banks are super cautious at the moment,'
            Philippe Espinasse, a former head of equity capital markets for
            Asia at Nomura Holdings Inc. and author of 'IPO: a Global
            Guide,' said by phone from Hong Kong today. 'They might have
            quite a bit to lose by staying on the deal if there were a
            direct link between the company's senior management and someone
            they employ.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Serve as Joint Lead Underwriter of Alberta Refinery</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will join Royal
            Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce leading
            the debt sale to finance a C$8.5 billion Alberta oil refinery
            that has the backing of the provincial government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will work as joint-lead underwriters for bonds to
            finance the Sturgeon upgrader and refinery in Redwater, Alberta,
            Ian MacGregor, chairman of North West Upgrading Inc., one of the
            partners in the joint venture, said through spokeswoman Shauna
            MacDonald. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The project is expected to be 80 percent financed by debt
            with the rest coming from equity, so long as the project
            maintains an investment grade credit rating, North West said in
            a Dec. 4 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has incurred C$1.5 billion of the project's
            cost and the Alberta government and the other partner in the
            venture, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ), have committed to
            further financing through the purchase of C$600 million of
            subordinated debt, North West said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alberta's government, which has the top AAA rating from
            Moody's Investors Service, Standard Poor's and DBRS,
            has agreed to pay down three-quarters of the debt over 30 years
            through the processing fees it will pay the refinery to process
            the bitumen the government already receives as royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government is expected to supply 75 percent of the
            bitumen to the project. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The project is expected to commence operations in September
            2017, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion Bank won top spot among underwriters of
            Canadian government debt last year after it managed the sale of
            the largest provincial bond ever: C$5 billion of debt to fund a
            hydroelectric project in Newfoundland and Labrador, which itself
            won a loan guarantee from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBC was the top underwriter of corporate debt in Canada
            last year with CIBC coming in third and JPMorgan in 16th place,
            according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When SurveyMonkey Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dave Goldberg wanted to buy out investors from his
            Internet company and attract new ones who wouldn't balk at his aim to stay private, he steered clear of
            traditional startup financiers in the venture-capital community. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Goldberg
            turned to an entirely different adviser: JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jimmy Lee, vice
            chairman of the investment bank who normally works on multibillion dollar deals, traveled from New York to
            SurveyMonkey's headquarters in Palo Alto, California, to brainstorm Goldberg's options. Goldberg later hired
            JPMorgan to lead a $350 million syndicated loan for the online survey provider as part of an $800 million
            recapitalization the closely held company completed last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Considering what a small
            company we are, SurveyMonkey isn't something Jimmy would usually spend time on,' Goldberg, who is married to
            Facebook Inc. (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, said in an interview. The recapitalization,
            which also involved selling $444 million in equity to Goldberg, Tiger Global Management LLC and Google Inc.
            (GOOG), valued SurveyMonkey at $1.35 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street investment banks -- from
            JPMorgan to Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) -- are increasingly catering to closely
            held technology startups, especially in Silicon Valley. While firms led by Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) have long cultivated relationships with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to later
            earn fees managing initial public offerings and advising on acquisitions, many banks have expanded the
            roster of services in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan in Court as Berlin Transport Disputes Deal Costs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) employees
            discussed why they shouldn't reveal to their client, Berlin's
            transport authority, what the bank stood to gain from a complex
            derivative deal that's now at the center of a U.K. court case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Phone transcripts cited by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe in a
            London trial show JPMorgan staff referring to Matthias Meier, an
            employee in the German company's finance department, before the
            2007 transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't want to show to Meier that we are making so much
            money on it right?' Johannes Banner, a JPMorgan salesman, asked
            a colleague in 2006, according to BVG's court documents. Another
            banker called Meier a 'pain in the a--e' and said they should
            'sting' him. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sued the firm, which operates Berlin's trains and
            buses, in 2008 for about $200 million it says it's owed from the
            credit-default swap transaction. The lender argues BVG was only
            a victim of bad luck and the deal turned costly because of
            unprecedented events in financial markets during 2008. The case
            went to trial in London this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tim Lord, a lawyer for BVG, told the court yesterday the
            transport authority had never properly understood the so-called
            'synthetic, single-tranche collateralized debt obligation' and
            was misled by JPMorgan and its lawyers at Clifford Chance LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is paying a
            lower relative cost to borrow than before the financial crisis
            even after ceding more than a year's profit to settle disputes
            linked to faulty mortgages and Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank borrowed $5.25 billion yesterday in
            an offering that included 10-year securities yielding 1.125
            percentage points more than Treasuries, the narrowest spread
            among similar JPMorgan notes since 2005. The measure, used to
            gauge creditworthiness, has contracted from 1.33 points a year
            ago and is the tightest among similar-maturity bonds of Wall
            Street competitors including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They still command some of the best rates among the big
            universal banks, by all means,' Chris Baker, a credit analyst
            at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's after spending more than $23 billion on legal
            settlements in 2013, which helped end a three-year streak of
            record annual earnings even as it led the world in corporate-bond underwriting for the sixth straight year.
            While litigation
            expenses may remain elevated in 2014, JPMorgan's earnings power
            means any legal issues should be manageable, according to
            Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hard-to-Sell Junk Debt Lures Oaktree to JPMorgan: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bond investors are losing their
            aversion to difficult-to-trade corporate debt that handed them
            some of the biggest losses in the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield note buyers demand to own older, smaller
            junk bonds that trade infrequently has shrunk to an average 0.25
            percentage point this month from more than 1 percentage point a
            year ago, according to Barclays Plc data. JPMorgan Chase Co.
            money manager Jim Shanahan said he's preferring 'good credit
            quality and less liquidity' when picking bonds, while Howard Marks, the head of distressed debt investor
            Oaktree Capital
            Group LLC (OAK), said he's finding bigger potential gains in private,
            less-traded debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The evaporating premium for illiquid assets is showing the
            depths to which money managers are reaching to boost returns
            after a five-year rally that pushed relative yields on junk
            bonds to the least since August 2007. With Federal Reserve
            monetary policies suppressing interest-rate benchmarks for a
            sixth year, credit buyers are showing more concern that they'll
            miss out on a continued rally than get stuck with debt that lost
            26 percent during the market seizure in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For the past several years, people have been concerned
            about liquidity,' said Eric Gross, a credit strategist at
            Barclays in New York. 'Now we're hearing more about people
            seeking out illiquid bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fragile Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Such debt tends to be more vulnerable to price swings when
            market sentiment deteriorates, because there are fewer buyers to
            bid on it when investor withdrawals force money managers to
            sell. Those risks intensified after stricter banking rules
            accelerated a pullback by Wall Street dealers that used their
            own money to facilitate trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed cut their
            holdings of corporate bonds by 76 percent to $56 billion after
            peaking at $235 billion in 2007, Fed data through March show.
            After the central bank changed the way it reported the holdings
            in April, net speculative-grade bond holdings fell as much as 24
            percent to a low of $5.63 billion in May before rising to $7.7
            billion on Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are demanding an average yield of 5.94 percent to
            own bonds sold at least 18 months ago in batches of less than
            $250 million, Barclays data show. That compares with an average
            5.7 percent for newer debt offerings of at least $500 million.
            The gap, which averaged 0.5 percentage point last year and 0.92
            percentage point in 2012, reached as much as 1.95 percentage
            points at the peak of the financial crisis in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Classic' Cycle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on MGM Resort International's $238 million of
            6.875 percent notes, which were issued in 2006 and mature in
            April 2016, has dropped 2.4 percentage points during the past
            year to 1.85 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
            reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
            That compares with a decline of 0.5 percentage point to 5.4
            percent on the casino owner's $1.25 billion offering of nine-year, 6.625 percent securities in December
            2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As people continue to look for yield and performance,
            they're willing to move into less-liquid areas of the market,'
            said Shanahan, who manages high-yield credit investments for
            JPMorgan's $1.5 trillion asset management unit. 'You're seeing
            a classic market cycle of people looking for pockets of value.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Intoxicating Brew' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With corporate borrowers selling record volumes of debt to
            lock in all-time low yields amid global central bank stimulus,
            'there is a tremendous and potentially unsustainable amount of
            paper in investors' hands, and this harsh reality is causing
            much angst,' according to a McKinsey Co. and Greenwich
            Associates report in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher, a
            former managing partner of a fund that bought distressed debt,
            said in a speech last week that he'd 'have to hire Sherlock
            Holmes to find a single distressed company priced attractively
            enough to buy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five years after the Fed started holding benchmark rates at
            about zero and pumping more than $3 trillion into the financial
            system to ignite growth, Fisher warned in the Jan. 14 remarks to
            the National Association of Corporate Directors that signs are
            emerging that Fed stimulus has made for 'an intoxicating
            brew.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even as the central bank starts slowing monthly bond
            purchases to $75 billion from $85 billion, yields on dollar-denominated speculative-grade bonds have fallen
            to 6.21 percent,
            0.22 percentage point from the record low in May 2013, according
            to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, which provide bigger cushions of extra
            yield over benchmark rates than higher-rated debt, are governed
            by idiosyncratic deal documents and aren't as frequently traded.
            While trading in speculative-grade bonds has risen, volumes have
            failed to keep pace with a market that's expanded 71 percent
            since 2008 as Wall Street's biggest banks reduce their holdings
            of riskier assets in the face of new regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by
            Moody's Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard
            Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are emboldened by a U.S. economy that will
            probably expand by 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent in 2015
            from 1.9 percent in last year, according to a Bloomberg survey
            of 83 economists. High-yield bond funds have received $3.85
            billion of deposits since the end of September, according to
            data compiled by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, as investors
            gained conviction that the U.S. economic recovery was
            strengthening. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent by
            Dec. 31 from 10 percent in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Homework &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Money has found it very easy to flow into public,
            mainstream things,' said Marks, Oaktree's chairman, in a Dec.
            10 presentation for investors. 'The best credit opportunities
            are in niche markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said the firm is earning about 11.5 percent to extend
            loans to smaller companies, about twice as much as the yield on
            a junk bond of comparable quality. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These deals are small and 'entirely illiquid,' he said.
            'It requires a lot of due diligence.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Publicly traded business-development corporations, which
            lend to the smallest and riskiest companies, attracted $4.1
            billion last year, the most since 2007, as the firms known as
            BDCs gained an average 16.4 percent. The firms are juicing
            returns by borrowing about 50 cents for every dollar raised from
            equity investors, up from 36 cents in 2011, according to data
            compiled by Keefe, Bruyette Woods analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Filling Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BDCs and other alternative asset managers that lend to
            small and mid-sized companies are filling a role traditionally
            dominated by banks, J.P. Morgan Asset Management's Shanahan said
            in a telephone interview. Holding smaller, less-traded
            securities can boost investor returns while maintaining a higher
            level of credit quality, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Credit is good and likely to be good over the horizon,'
            he said. 'People become less concerned about liquidity as
            you're less likely to need it in the near term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect against
            losses on U.S. and European corporate bonds jumped to the
            highest in five weeks. La Banque Postale SA is turning to the
            covered bond market to fund its mortgage business that has grown
            by about 50 percent over the past four years and can no longer
            be financed solely by customer deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Credit Benchmarks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
            to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 1.5 basis points to 67
            basis points as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to prices
            compiled by Bloomberg. In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index
            of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings increased 2.6 to
            75.2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both gauges, which typically rise as investor confidence
            deteriorates and fall as it improves, are trading at the highest
            intraday levels since Dec. 19. Credit swaps pay the buyer face
            value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
            value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
            annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banking unit of France's postal service, which has a
            home loan portfolio of 50 billion euros ($67.8 billion), will
            now fund 20 percent of that business with covered securities,
            according to Stephane Magnan, head of asset and liability
            management at the bank in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender is now the sixth-biggest mortgage lender in
            France, having taken market share from Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and
            BNP Paribas SA, according to SP. The bank's business expanded
            even as France's economy struggles to grow after exiting
            recession last year and unemployment touches a 16-year high. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Japan's No. 2 Equity Strategist Kitano to Quit JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s chief equity
            strategist in Tokyo, Hajime Kitano, will resign the investment
            bank, he wrote in an e-mail to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kitano was ranked Japan's No. 2 equity researcher for 2012
            by Institutional Investor magazine, falling from the top spot he
            held the previous year. JPMorgan spokeswoman Yukako Yoshino
            declined to comment. Kitano was not immediately available when
            called. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Kitano had deep insights, and he was popular with his
            analysis,' said Koji Toda, chief fund manager at Tokyo-based
            Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about $174 billion. 'He was
            helpful in analyzing past events for future investments. I'm

            &lt;p&gt;Kitano, who topped Institutional Investor's survey in 2011
            and 2007, said in his e-mail that conveying information on the

        <headline>JPMorgan Gives CEO Dimon 74% Raise to $20 Million in 2013</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) gave Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon a 74 percent raise to $20 million
            last year, bringing his pay closer to where it stood before he was penalized for faulty oversight of botched
            derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board's compensation package for Dimon, 57, who also serves as
            chairman, included $18.5 million in restricted stock, the New York-based lender said today in a regulatory
            filing. His salary was unchanged at $1.5 million and he got no cash bonus, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Board members decided to keep Dimon's pay below previous peak levels after criminal and regulatory
            probes cost JPMorgan more than $23 billion in settlements during 2013. The directors cut his 2012 package in
            half last January to $11.5 million, saying he bore 'ultimate responsibility' for failures that led to
            derivatives trading losses in the London Whale episode. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In raising Dimon's pay, the
            board of directors cited 'sustained long-term performance; gains in market share and customer satisfaction;
            and the regulatory issues the company has faced and the steps the company has taken to resolve those
            issues,' according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The restricted stock vests 50 percent after two years
            and 50 percent after three years, the bank said. Awarding Dimon's total bonus in shares ties his pay 'to the
            company's future performance, including continued progress on the company's regulatory agenda,' the firm
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Performance Priority &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board's compensation committee is
            led by Lee Raymond, 75, Exxon Mobil Corp.'s former chairman and CEO. JPMorgan's stock climbed 33 percent
            last year, matching the 81-company Standard Poor's 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Obviously they
            paid more attention to the operational performance and stock-price performance and less to the litigation
            issues,' said Joseph Sorrentino, a managing director at Steven Hall Partners, a New York-based compensation
            consulting firm. 'Maybe there's an argument that settling those items at those levels and removing the
            uncertainty there, maybe that's worth something as well, but hard to know.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief
            Financial Officer Marianne Lake, 44, received 80,346 shares, worth $4.65 million at the price of $57.875,
            the level at which Dimon's shares were valued. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, 43, received stock valued
            at $9.75 million, as did Mike Cavanagh, 48, co-head of the firm's corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Support &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, 51, the other co-head, received the same
            total pay as Cavanagh, and it was structured differently because of compensation rules in the U.K. where
            Pinto is based, according to a person briefed on the awards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any cash awards for named
            executives will be disclosed in the firm's proxy statement later this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon became
            CEO at the end of 2005 and added the title of chairman a year later. His reputation as a top manager, along
            with his pay, has fluctuated since then. While JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as the only large
            U.S. bank to avoid quarterly losses, the trading debacle in 2012 prompted some investors to call for
            splitting his dual roles. Shareholders rejected that proposal at a meeting in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon
            was paid $49.9 million for 2007, including special stock awards. During the financial crisis a year later,
            he took only a $1 million salary. He got $15.2 million for 2009, and $23 million for each of the two years
            that followed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Settlement Costs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In last year's third quarter, the
            bank posted its first loss on Dimon's watch after taking a $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting
            litigation and regulatory probes. The deficit ended the firm's streak of three record annual profits.
            Full-year net income fell 16 percent to $17.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon pushed last year to resolve
            government investigations, including at least eight Justice Department probes listed in the firm's quarterly
            report in October. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Settlements since then have included a record $13 billion deal to
            resolve inquiries into mortgage-bond sales. The bank paid $2.6 billion and avoided criminal prosecution
            while settling claims it failed to stop Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The firm also paid more than $1
            billion last year tied to the botched derivatives bets, which lost more than $6.2 billion in 2012. In that
            case, U.S. and U.K. regulators faulted its oversight of a trader known as the London Whale because his
            positions were so large. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon told journalists earlier this month that he couldn't
            predict whether he might be able to put the legal disputes behind the bank this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Favored by Top Fund Looking Overseas: Australia Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AMP Capital Australian Corporate
            Bond Fund (AMPACBA), which outperformed its peers over the past decade,
            prefers U.S. and European banks to the South Pacific nation's
            lenders on improving economic prospects in those two regions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), 2013's best-performing corporate
            bond, is the fund's biggest holding, the AMP website shows. BNP
            Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase Co. are among the top 10, which
            include Westpac Banking Corp. as the only Australia-based
            lender. The AMP fund returned 6.2 percent in 2013, beating 21 of
            its peers, according to Morningstar Australia Pty. It topped the
            ranks of funds that invest mainly in Australian bonds over the
            past decade with an average return of 7.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's growth will trail the U.S. for the first time
            in four years as a mining boom cools, according to a Bloomberg
            survey of economists. The cost premium for protecting debt of
            the Big Four Australian banks over U.S. counterparts touched the
            most in almost six years this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The kind of banks that we've identified in places like
            the U.S., in parts of Europe and the U.K., and to a lesser
            extent in Australia, were all going to benefit from economies
            that were improving,' said Mark Beardow, 46, who runs the A$2
            billion ($1.75 billion) fund in Sydney. 'Many parts of the
            global corporate bond market are continuing to meaningfully
            deleverage, particularly financials.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Six-Year High &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average cost of credit-default swaps on Commonwealth
            Bank of Australia, Westpac and the country's next two biggest
            lenders versus the seven biggest U.S. banks widened to 17.4
            basis points on Jan. 3, the most since March 2008. It was 12.4
            basis points as of yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beardow, who talked by telephone yesterday, manages the
            fund in Sydney with Jeff Brunton and David Carruthers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. economic growth will quicken by 0.9 percentage point
            this year to 2.8 percent, based on Bloomberg News surveys of
            economists. The euro area's economy will go to a 1 percent
            expansion from a 0.4 percent contraction. In Australia, the pace
            will pick up by 0.35 percentage point to 2.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds of London-based Lloyds returned about 8 percent
            on average last year, the most among the biggest 50 corporate
            issuers in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Global Corporate
            High Yield Index. The bank's debt issued in Australia returned
            4.95 percent in 2013, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Big Four &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The returns beat the bonds of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac,
            Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National
            Australia Bank Ltd., the nation's four biggest lenders. The
            latter topped the list with a 4.71 percent gain, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens cut the
            benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.5 percent last year
            to maintain economic growth as the economy struggles to
            diversify amid a drop-off in mining investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beardow said he favors shorter-term securities in case
            yields rise. The fund's duration was 1.39 years in December,
            versus 2.76 years for the benchmark it uses to gauge
            performance, according to the AMP website. Duration is a measure
            of a portfolio's sensitivity to changes in bond yields, and a
            smaller figure offers more protection should borrowing costs
            increase. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. 10-year yields will be 3 percent to 3.5 percent by
            year-end, he said, from 2.76 percent as of 1:31 p.m. today in
            Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australian 10-year yields will climb to 4.25-4.75 percent,
            according to Beardow, from 4.05 percent today. Yields on U.S.
            and Australian government securities due in 10 years and longer
            have a correlation of 0.948. A figure of 1 means they move in
            lock-step. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fair Value' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Now we think rates are largely fair value,' he said.
            'We see fair value continuing to edge up.' The RBA will keep
            its benchmark at 2.5 percent this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Evans, the top-ranked chief economist at Westpac, says
            Stevens will need to cut the benchmark rate to 2 percent. Evans
            is the most accurate forecaster on Australia's economy,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would expect to see yields down in this country,'
            Evans said in a Jan. 24 interview. 'That would suggest that you
            should be buying bonds. We're not concerned about any credit
            risks associated with the banking sector. Bank bonds would
            similarly track the capital appreciation that we're expecting in
            government bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields will fall to 4 percent by year-end, Evans
            said in a Bloomberg survey of banks conducted Jan. 16 to Jan.
            21. It was the lowest forecast among 15 responses. An investor
            who bought today would earn about 4 percent if the forecast is
            correct, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The AMP Australian Corporate fund can invest up to 30
            percent of its assets in global corporate bonds, Beardow said.
            The challenge is to generate income with company notes and
            protect returns against higher borrowing costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're pretty positive about the economy,' he said. 'We
            want to be particularly active around the possibility that
            yields do rise very sharply, and we're keeping duration pretty
            short.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seen Paying Dimon $34 Million Award This Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon, who got a 74 percent raise for his work in
            2013, stands to reap a separate and bigger payday within months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's board of directors, having delayed a decision
            for more than a year, has yet to say whether Dimon, 57, can
            collect 2 million stock options originally granted in 2008 and
            now worth about $34 million. Last week, the board increased his
            annual pay to $20 million from $11.5 million a year ago, when he
            was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Dimon's incentive package was created six years ago,
            JPMorgan grew to become the nation's largest bank with shares
            outperforming the industry, and then snapped a three-year run of
            record profits as costs from government probes surged. The
            board's decision to boost Dimon's annual pay despite mounting
            legal settlements shows he probably will get the full options
            award, said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation-consulting
            firm Johnson Associates Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's obvious the board wanted to send a signal about what
            they think of him,' Johnson said. 'It'd be very inconsistent
            to say, 'You're our guy, and we want to send an emphatic public
            message that we think very highly of you.' And then, 'Oh by the
            way, you didn't earn this over the last five years.'' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) paid about
            $35.7 million for an interest in eight Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA)
            geothermal power plants in California and Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to pay Ormat an additional $8.7 million for
            25 percent of the value of production tax credits generated by
            the plants through the end of 2016, the Reno, Nevada-based
            developer said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The so-called tax equity investment gives JPMorgan
            production tax credits and accelerated depreciation benefits

            deductions for tax purposes than we are currently able to
            utilize,' Ormat Chief Executive Officer Dita Bronicki said in
            the statement. The production tax credit for geothermal is 2.2
            cents a kilowatt-hour and applies to the first 10 years of a
            plant's operation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The eight plants are part of Ormat's Ormesa, Heber and
            Mammoth complexes in California and its Steamboat and Brady
            complexes in Nevada, Bronicki said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan invested $24.9 million in four of Ormat's Nevada
            facilities in a similar transaction in February 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Euro Bonds in Slowest New Issue Start Since 2008</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which sold 10-
            year dollar bonds at a record low 3.2 percent two weeks ago,
            priced similar-maturity notes in euros as debt sales in the
            currency head for the slowest January since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank by assets, which last issued euro
            debt in November, sold 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of bonds
            to yield 95 basis points above the swap rate, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the 155 basis-point
            spread Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid on 10-year debt it sold
            Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are poised to overtake industrial companies as the
            safest borrowers in the $5.1 trillion U.S. corporate bond market
            for the first time since the start of the financial crisis,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors demand an
            extra 154 basis points in yield over benchmarks to buy bonds of
            JPMorgan, Wells Fargo Co. and other lenders, compared with 138
            basis points for companies from Alcoa Inc. (AA) to Ford Motor Co.,
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Financials are perhaps dominating sales so far this year
            as they issued about 30 percent less debt in 2012 than they had
            in redemptions,' said Jonathan Pitkanen, the London-based head
            of credit research at Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. 'The
            macro environment in Europe doesn't look to be improving which
            is why perhaps investors are becoming more wary of buying the
            bonds of non-financial corporates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interest Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
            dollars is holding near a 20-month low. The three-month cross-
            currency basis swap was little changed at 14 basis points below
            Euribor, the lowest cost to swap since May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's 1.5 billion euros of 2.75 percent bonds due in
            10 years which it sold in August yield 83 basis points more than
            swaps, 17 tighter than at issue, Bloomberg data show. The spread
            on Goldman Sachs' 3.25 percent debt due February 2023 has
            tightened five basis points since issue last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's sales lift corporate bond issuance in euros and
            pounds to 60.1 billion euros ($80.8 billion) so far this year,
            the slowest start to a year since 2008 when 34 billion euros
            were issued in the first three weeks of January, according to
            Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BASF SE (BAS) offered the only non-financial benchmark-sized bond
            in the single currency, Bloomberg data show. It priced 500
            million euros of eight-year notes to yield 38 basis points more
            than swaps, the tight end of the 40 basis point range initially
            marketed, a person with knowledge of that deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Good Value' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has been lots of seven-year to 10-year maturity
            issuance which is desirable if you are a treasurer but
            introduces an element of volatility for investors versus more
            traditional five-year paper,' said Jens Vanbrabant, lead
            portfolio manager at London-based investment firm ECM Asset
            Management Ltd. 'Nevertheless there are areas that still
            represent good value.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
            of credit-default swaps on the senior debt of banks and insurers
            rose one basis point to 136 at 3:35 p.m. in London. The Markit
            iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
            ratings increased one basis point to 106. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
            on 50 companies with mostly high-yield ratings added two basis
            points to 422. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
            million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
            to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
            exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
            should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Technology VP Dies in Fall From London Headquarters</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A vice president in technology
            operations, Gabriel Magee, died after falling from JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s London headquarters, the bank said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 39-year-old fell from 25 Bank Street in the Canary
            Wharf area onto a ninth-floor roof, London's Metropolitan Police
            said, having been called to the scene at 8:02 this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magee had worked for JPMorgan since 2004 in the corporate
            and investment bank's technology support department, the New
            York-based lender said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are deeply saddened to have lost a member of the
            JPMorgan family at 25 Bank Street today,' said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London.
            'Our thoughts
            and sympathy are with his family and his friends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 11-year-old skyscraper is 33 stories high, according to
            building-data provider Emporis. It was formerly the European
            headquarters of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for
            the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2008. The police are
            not treating the death as suspicious and no arrests have been
            made. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took over the office and began moving investment
            banking staff over to the building in January 2012, according to
            the lender's website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Madoff Victims' Group Seeks to Opt Out of JPMorgan Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bernard Madoff victims who withdrew
            more money from the con man's firm than they invested -- and
            were slated for no recovery -- asked to be excluded from JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s $543 million settlement of lawsuits over the fraud
            so they can sue the bank on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A group of 193 investors said in a filing yesterday in U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the accord between JPMorgan
            and Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff's defunct
            company, doesn't cover 'net winners.' They asked for court
            permission to not be part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group's lawyer, Helen Davis Chaitman of Becker
            Poliakoff LLP in New York, said she intends to file a new
            lawsuit on behalf of these and other victims who say they were
            harmed in Madoff's $17 billion Ponzi scheme, even though they
            didn't lose their principal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The existing settlement is 'inherently unfair,' Chaitman
            said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ponzi scheme's net winners have been fighting for their
            rights almost since Madoff's 2008 arrest. Their argument is that
            they are entitled to rely on the brokerage statements received
            from the con man's firm and should be compensated accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fictitious Statements &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Critics, ranging from trustee Picard and appeals court
            judges to investigators, say that Madoff clients received
            fictitious statements incorporating profits from trades that
            never happened, and those who lost money should be compensated
            first. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As a measure, Madoff customers' assets were originally
            estimated at $65 billion, including profits -- almost four times
            as much as Picard's current calculation of the $17 billion
            invested and lost when the Ponzi scheme collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those who profited from the Ponzi scheme -- though without
            getting all the money reflected on their brokerage statements --
            also have battled for their right to sue investors who allegedly
            knew about the fraud. Picard and the courts have mostly opposed
            them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mark Kornblau, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on
            the group's position on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Warning Signs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking to
            move on from allegations it helped prolong Madoff's fraud by
            ignoring warning signs and reaping profit from the con man's
            business. The bank agreed Jan. 7 to pay $1.7 billion to the U.S.
            to resolve criminal allegations and $350 million in a case by
            the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank simultaneously agreed to pay Picard $325 million
            to settle his civil lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims,
            and another $218 million to resolve two related class-action
            lawsuits that were filed with Picard's assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A hearing on the proposed accord is scheduled for Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chaitman said in yesterday's filing that victims who
            invested with Madoff for years, and believed the trading in
            their accounts was real, are entitled to some of their fake
            profit because Madoff deprived them of legitimate investment
            opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated there are about 2,500 net winners who
            want to recover some or all of the fake profit they saw on their
            customer account statements. 'Net losers' withdrew less money
            from Madoff's firm than they put in. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Parallel Efforts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the class-action lawsuits, JPMorgan is accused of aiding
            and abetting embezzlement, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust
            enrichment and gross negligence in relation to Madoff's fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal
            investigators have resulted in a total recovery for victims of
            almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard
            has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions
            more held in reserve until legal issues are resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chaitman and Picard's spokeswoman, Amanda Remus, both
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving
            a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina.
            Others including his brother Peter Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term, have pleaded guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five members of Madoff's inner circle, who worked for the
            con man for decades, are on trial in Manhattan federal court on
            charges of helping perpetuate the fraud to get rich. The five
            have pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection
            Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-bk-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District
            of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Coface SA, the French credit insurer
            owned by investment bank Natixis (KN) SA, is working with its parent
            and JPMorgan Chase Co. as it prepares for an initial public
            offering, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coface may raise about 500 million euros ($678 million) in
            an IPO being planned for this year, said one of the people, who
            asked not to be named because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Natixis plans to sell Coface shares on the stock market by
            the end of June as part of a plan to invest more in wholesale
            banking, asset management and 'specialized' financial
            services, Chief Executive Officer Laurent Mignon said in
            November. The volume of equity capital market deals in Europe
            almost doubled last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show,
            encouraging companies to line up asset sales for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for the banks declined to comment. A
            spokeswoman for Coface didn't respond to a request for comment
            left outside regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coface had an operating profit of 189 million euros on
            revenue of 1.57 billion euros in 2012, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Hires Petty as Co-Head of Health Care in Europe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) hired Cathrin Petty from U.K. private-equity firm Vitruvian Partners LLP
            as
            co-head of its health-care investment banking team in Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa amid rising activity in the sector. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Petty, who has almost 20 years of experience in health
            care, will work alongside the team's current head, Rakesh Patel,
            according a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. She will start next
            week and report to Laurence Hollingworth. The contents of the
            memo, written by Vis Raghavan, head of EMEA banking, were
            confirmed by a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before working as a partner at Vitruvian, Petty spent a
            decade at buyout firm Apax Partners LLP, eight of those years as
            a partner in the global health-care team, in charge of private-equity investments, the memo shows. Petty,
            who interned at
            JPMorgan in 1994, also worked at Schroders doing buyouts and
            venture deals for medical technology and pharmaceutical
            companies in Europe, India and the U.S., according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry globally rose
            to $80.1 billion last year from $52 billion in 2012, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total mergers and acquisitions
            are 'set to accelerate' this year, led by pharmaceutical deals
            based on calculations of free-cash flow versus corporate bond

            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, whose eight years atop JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) have made him one of Wall Street's
            most powerful leaders, said he'll start treatment for throat cancer, raising new questions about succession
            plans at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, the company's chairman and chief executive
            officer, told employees and shareholders in a memo his condition is curable and that he'll continue running

            Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, limiting his travel, the CEO said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon,
            58, has led New York-based JPMorgan since the end of 2005, navigating the 2008 financial crisis without a

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Corporate Dealing Services Business</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to sell a
            business that manages stock-based pay plans for companies to
            Equiniti Group Ltd., a closely held U.K. financial-services
            provider. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equiniti, based in Lancing, England, didn't disclose what
            it will pay for JPMorgan's Corporate Dealing Services unit. The
            transaction is scheduled to be completed by Aug. 31, Equiniti
            said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The acquisition 'further strengthens our position,' Paul
            Matthews, managing director of corporate markets at Equiniti,
            said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest investment bank by revenue will partner
            with Equiniti to offer dealing services for share-based
            compensation packages to its corporate broking clients,
            according to the statement. JPMorgan is the largest corporate
            broker to companies in the FTSE 100, offering advice to 34
            clients in the index, according to Adviser Ranking Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equiniti was started in 2007 when Advent International
            Corp. acquired Lloyds Banking Group Plc's Lloyds TSB Registrars
            shareholder-services business in a management buyout. The firm,
            which manages share plans on behalf of customers, has 2,700
            employees and a client base of 1,600 companies, a spokeswoman
            for Equiniti said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Internal Probe Cleared Hannam of Market Abuse, He Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, formerly one of JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s top merger advisers, said the bank cleared him in
            an internal investigation before the U.K. finance regulator
            fined him for disclosing inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan believed that I had not done market abuse,'
            Hannam testified at a London court today, where he is fighting
            the 450,000-pound ($687,000) fine. 'They carried out this very
            serious investigation and I assure you that if they had found I
            had' broken any regulatory rules, 'I would not have been an
            employee there.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two e-mail messages form the basis of a proposed civil
            market-abuse fine against Hannam by the U.K. Financial Conduct
            Authority, which considers the content insider information.
            Hannam, formerly JPMorgan's global chairman of equity capital
            markets, said the notes were in the 'best interest' of his
            client, Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), and is challenging the sanction at a
            court hearing at the Upper Tribunal in London that started
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, who resigned from the New York-based bank after the
            fine, is one of the highest-profile finance workers the
            regulator has targeted. Hannam was among the bankers advising
            Xstrata Plc before it was acquired by Glencore International
            Plc. (GLEN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I particularly enjoyed working for JPMorgan,' Hannam
            said. 'I would probably still be at JPMorgan.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, Heritage CEO Tony Buckingham and Chief Financial
            Officer Paul Atherton are scheduled to testify at the trial,
            which could last as long as two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, a former soldier, graduated from Imperial College
            London and London Business School, and trained at Salomon
            Brothers. In 1992, he joined Robert Fleming Co., which was
            bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000. Four years later, he helped
            to set up JPMorgan's joint venture with London-based Cazenove
            Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wizz Air, Eastern Europe's biggest budget carrier, has appointed Barclays Plc (BARC), Citigroup
            Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase Co. to manage an initial public offering in London, according to people with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sale of the carrier, created in 2003, may happen as early
            as the second half of this year, one of the people said, asking not to be named as the plans aren't public.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies including state-run U.K. postal service Royal Mail Group Ltd. and vodka maker
            Stock Spirits Group are lining up IPOs in London as global investors return to the market. The carrier faces
            heightened competition in some of its markets as Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA), Europe's biggest discount
            airline, adds more bases in the east of the continent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Wizz Air in
            Geneva declined to comment on the proposed sale. Spokesmen for Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan also
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wizz Air has a fleet of more than 40 Airbus SAS single-aisle
            planes, with an average age of about three years, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Issuers in
            Europe, the Middle East and Africa raised about $12 billion in IPOs this year, more than double what they
            sold in the same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Deepens Iraq Business After Citi, Standard Chartered</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is the latest
            international bank after Citigroup Inc. (C) and Standard Chartered
            Plc (STAN) to expand business in Iraq as OPEC's second-largest producer
            boosts crude oil output and rebuilds its economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan signed a one-year agreement yesterday to help the
            Trade Bank of Iraq finance imports of goods and services, John Gibbons, managing director and EMEA regional
            executive for the
            New York-based bank, said in an interview in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our focus is to open more letters of credit through the
            Trade Bank of Iraq on behalf of the government and its
            ministries,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq, with the world's fifth-largest proven oil reserves,
            is modernizing its infrastructure and energy industry after
            decades of sanctions, war and neglect. It produced 3.2 million
            barrels a day of crude in June, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg, and targets output of 3.5 million barrels by the end
            of the year. The government is boosting spending by 18 percent
            in 2013 to $118 billion, and the International Monetary Fund
            forecasts an annual economic growth rate of 9 percent, the
            fastest after Libya among 18 countries in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials are in talks with international banks about
            the opening of offices and branches in the country, Abdul-Basit Turki, acting governor of Iraq's central
            bank, said today in an
            interview in Baghdad. 'It is a rich market and the investment
            opportunities are huge,' Turki said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banking Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign banks were barred from the country until after the
            2003 U.S.-led invasion ousted the government of Saddam Hussein.
            Today, 15 international banks operate in Iraq, competing with
            seven state banks, 23 private lenders and nine banks operating
            under Islamic rules, according to the central bank's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup plans to open representative offices and branches
            in Baghdad and the cities of Basra and Erbil to benefit from an
            estimated $1 trillion of infrastructure spending, Mayank Malik,
            the U.S. bank's chief executive officer for Jordan, Iraq, Syria
            and the Palestinian territories, said in a June 27 interview.
            The lender is among international banks seeking to finance a
            pipeline to export Iraqi oil and natural gas through Jordan,
            Nateq Balasem Khalaf, deputy director general of Iraq's State
            Company for Oil Projects, said July 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered has said it will open branches this year
            in Baghdad and Erbil, followed by a third office next year in
            Basra, a southern oil hub. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Import Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement with JPMorgan will help the Trade Bank of
            Iraq 'open more letters of credit that we're in need of,'
            TBI chairman and president Hamdiyah Al Jaff said in an interview
            in Baghdad yesterday. JPMorgan helped set up TBI, the country's
            largest bank for trade finance, to facilitate imports needed for
            Iraq's postwar reconstruction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks in the country are set for growth in earnings and
            assets as a surge in lending in Iraq outpaces much of the Middle
            East, according to Singapore-based Sansar Capital Management
            LLC, which runs a fund with $30 million invested in Iraqi
            equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq's rising oil exports and a drop in the prime lending
            rate to 6 percent from 17 percent in 2008 are feeding the
            expansion. The five largest privately owned banks boosted their
            combined net income by 207 percent from 2010 to 2012 and more
            than doubled earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq's stock exchange drew investors in February when
            mobile operator Asiacell Communications PJSC listed after a $1.3
            billion share sale, in the Middle East's biggest initial public
            offering since 2008. The country's two other mobile operators,
            Zain Iraq and Korek Telecom, plan to sell shares in IPOs to
            comply with their license requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq is the biggest oil producer, after Saudi Arabia, in
            the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. &lt;/p&gt;

            Internet startup that's filing for insolvency after saying it
            falsified accounts for at least four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Euroland Focus fund had 2.9 percent of its
            holdings invested in Gowex as of May 31, while the bank's Europe
            Focus fund had 2 percent of its portfolio dedicated to the
            stock, according to the most recently available data on their
            website. Danske's Europe Absolute fund had 2.7 percent of its
            portfolio invested in Gowex as of June 30, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gowex founder and Chief Executive Officer Jenaro Garcia
            resigned on July 5, taking responsibility for the accounting
            fraud after a 60 percent drop in share prices in the wake of a
            report last week by short-seller Gotham City Research LLP saying
            the company inflated revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The responsibility isn't with just one person, it's also
            with the auditor and market regulator,' said Javier Flores at
            investor group Asinver, who puts the number of individual Gowex
            shareholders at some 5,000. 'The damage isn't only economic;
            it's also about the reputation of the Spanish market.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Touts Nakheel Saying Default Doubtful: Islamic Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. is advising
            clients to buy Nakheel PJSC's Islamic bonds after last month's
            record slump as new projects boost the Dubai developer's
            earnings, while government backing makes a default improbable. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;State-run Nakheel's 4.27 billion dirhams ($1.2 billion) of
            sukuk yielded 9.88 percent at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai, down seven
            basis points this month, after surging 179 basis points in June.
            That's more than twice the average gain in yields on corporate
            Islamic debt tracked by HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indexes. JPMorgan
            listed Nakheel in a July 4 research note as its 'top overweight
            recommendation' among Dubai real-estate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakheel will manage to pay or refinance as much as half of
            the $3 billion of debt due in 2016 as it generates at least $1
            billion from new projects and land sales, JPMorgan said.
            Investors have demanded higher yields to hold Nakheel's bonds
            since the company drove Dubai to the brink of default in 2009,
            prompting the government to extend a bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government is quite unlikely to let Nakheel default
            on its bond obligations in 2016 after supporting the company
            under much more difficult circumstances,' JPMorgan analyst
            Zafar Nazim wrote in the note. 'Nakheel has been a beneficiary
            of real-estate recovery in Dubai. We believe that new project
            launches and plot sales were not baked in the original
            restructuring plan that was agreed in 2010.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Home Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakheel, known for building an island shaped like the frond
            of a palm tree and another like a world map off Dubai's coast,
            has received at least $8 billion of cash from the government
            since announcing a standstill agreement with creditors in 2009,
            JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real estate industry in Dubai, one of seven sheikhdoms
            of the United Arab Emirates, has started recovering from a crash
            that sent prices plunging more than 65 percent. New projects
            such as the world's biggest Ferris wheel, a new district with
            100 hotels and the world's largest mall were unveiled in the
            past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sale prices for residential units have risen 28 percent
            from a trough in January 2011, according to an index tracked by
            Jones Lang LaSalle. Dubai's economy grew 4.4 percent in 2012,
            the fastest pace in five years. Against this backdrop, JPMorgan
            also recommends Islamic debt of Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR), developer
            of the world's tallest tower, and Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority
            FZE, which leases commercial real estate in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Averting Default &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Emaar's 6.4 percent securities due in July
            2019 has declined 25 basis points this month to 5.59 percent
            today, while Jafza's 7 percent sukuk due a month earlier yielded
            5.43 percent, down 30 basis points. The yield on HSBC/Nasdaq
            Dubai's Corporate U.S. Dollar Sukuk Index advanced 73 basis
            points last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dubai was able to avert bond default in all of its
            government-related entities and its economy has recovered to
            pre-crisis levels,' JPMorgan said. 'Nakheel has been a
            beneficiary of real-estate recovery in Dubai.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai's credit risk returned this year to levels it hasn't
            seen since late 2008 amid the global credit crisis, after state-linked companies paid or refinanced at least
            $3.75 billion since
            the start of 2012. Five-year credit default swaps, which protect
            investors against non-payment of debt, dropped 130 basis points
            in the past year to 220 on July 5, according to CMA. Middle East
            contracts fell 13 basis points, on average, to 302 in the
            period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Risky Sector' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, property prices in Dubai are likely to ease 'due to
            high levels of future supply, limited debt availability and more
            mature market regulations,' Alan Robertson, chief executive
            officer for the Middle East and North Africa at Jones Lang
            LaSalle, said by e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors dumping emerging-market assets sold debt of Dubai
            property companies last month amid an emerging-market rout
            triggered by Federal Reserve plans to trim its bond-buying
            program. Nakheel's debt isn't rated, while Emaar's bonds non-investment grade at Moody's Investors Service
            and Standard
            Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dubai's real estate is still considered a risky sector,'
            said Montasser Khelifi, Dubai-based senior manager for global
            markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd. 'When there's turmoil
            in the bond market, investors sell the debt, even though new
            projects in Dubai are announced regularly these days.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakheel's business prospects are improving. The company
            said in May it sold 471 villas valued at almost 1.9 billion
            dirhams. The developer also expects to sign an agreement with
            banks to extend the maturity by eight years from 2015 on 8
            billion dirhams of debt, a spokeswoman said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investing in Nakheel's sukuk may be a risk worth taking,
            Khelifi said. 'While its very possible Nakheel won't have the
            money to repay the bonds, it's good news that they're seeking to
            refinance their debt,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MF Global Settlement With JPMorgan Unit Approved by Judge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit's
            $100 million settlement with MF Global Inc. liquidators won
            court approval, paving the way for the return of more money to
            the failed brokerage's former customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement will allocate $100 million for the return of
            customer property, according to an order entered today in
            bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The agreement resolves claims
            against JPMorgan arising from transfers of customer property in
            the days before MF Global entered bankruptcy, as well as its
            actions as one of the brokerage's primary banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The motion is granted in all respects and the settlement
            agreement is authorized,' U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn
            said in the order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former customers sued MF Global, New York-based JPMorgan
            and other parties over the firm's collapse and James W. Giddens,
            trustee for the liquidating brokerage, joined the lawsuit. U.S.
            District Judge Victor Marrero is overseeing the class-action
            case while Glenn is handling the bankruptcy wind-down. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Giddens seeks to return an additional $200 million to
            customers from the settlement, which also recoups $29 million in
            MF Global funds held at the bank and completes a previous return
            of $417 million by JPMorgan. The bank will pay an additional
            $7.5 million to cover plaintiffs' legal fees, according to court
            papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Key Lender &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd., the parent company once run by
            former New Jersey Governor and ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Co-Chairman Jon Corzine, filed for
            bankruptcy in 2011 after a $6.3
            billion trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe's
            most indebted nations. Most MF Global client funds were held in
            JPMorgan accounts, and the bank was a key lender to the parent
            before it collapsed in the eighth-largest U.S bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement resolves all outstanding matters between
            JPMorgan and the MF Global estate, its customers and creditors.
            JPMorgan will get a $60 million general unsecured claim in the
            brokerage liquidation and the companies won't pursue any other
            claims against each other, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was agent for a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global's
            parent company before it failed and also loaned money to the
            brokerage and other affiliates, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The holding company's Chapter 11 case is In re MF Global
            Holdings Ltd., 11-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). The broker liquidation is In
            re MF Global Inc., 11-02790, same court. The class-action case
            is 11-cv-7866, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
            York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan-Backed Debt Collector to Pay $3.2 Million Over FTC Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A debt-collection firm backed by
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s private equity unit agreed to pay $3.2
            million to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint that it
            illegally harassed consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fine, the largest levied by the FTC against a third-party debt collector according to an agency
            news release today,
            stems from charges that it used tactics including calling
            consumers multiple times a day, calling them early in the
            morning or late at night, and calling at consumers' workplaces.
            The company, Expert Global Solutions Inc., was also accused by
            the FTC of continuing to call consumers who denied owing a debt
            to its clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the settlement, if a consumer disputes the validity
            of the debt, the company must either end collection efforts or
            suspend them until they've conducted a 'reasonable
            investigation' to establish the debt's validity. The agreement
            also prohibits the company from treating consumers in the manner
            outlined in the FTC's charges, according to the agency's
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tom Hoy, a spokesman for the Expert Global, did not
            immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC news
            release describes the company as 'the world's largest debt
            collection operation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stake in the firm is held by its private
            investment arm, One Equity Partners. According to the JPMorgan
            investment unit's website, Expert Global is based in Horsham,
            Pennsylvania, and has revenues of about $2 billion dollars, and
            40,000 employees in 14 countries. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ally Drops JPMorgan as Underwriter for Public Offering</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc., the auto lender
            majority-owned by U.S. taxpayers, dropped JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            from the list of underwriters for its planned initial public
            offering, saying rival banks were more committed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
            Barclays Plc (BARC) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) were listed as underwriters in
            an amended filing today by Detroit-based Ally. A filing in
            October included JPMorgan in addition to those five banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The lineup of global coordinators is a reflection of the
            investment the various banks have made in the Ally relationship
            over the last year,' Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for the auto
            lender, said in an e-mail today. Tasha Pelio of New York-based
            JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department has paid lower underwriting
            fees than other sellers as it exits investments in firms bailed
            out during the financial crisis. Underwriting fees were less
            than 1 percent for the sale of stock in firms such as General
            Motors Co. and American International Group Inc., compared with
            an average of more than 3 percent for additional equity
            offerings in the U.S. this year and about 5.5 percent for IPOs,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is seeking to exit its 74 percent stake in Ally
            after previously getting rid of holdings in Citigroup and AIG.
            Ally has sold units and worked to limit liabilities from its
            bankrupt mortgage business as Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter seeks to repay a $17.2 billion
            bailout. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;First Data Corp., led by former
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) co-Chief Operating Officer Frank Bisignano,
            hired the New York-based bank's former Chief Information Officer
            Guy Chiarello as president. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chiarello, 53, will receive an annual base salary of $1
            million and a bonus of no less than $2.5 million for 2013,
            Atlanta-based First Data said today in a regulatory filing. He
            will also be granted a signing bonus of $6.5 million that can be
            clawed back if he quits or is terminated for cause within two
            years, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First Data, owned by private-equity firm KKR Co.,
            recruited Bisignano in April from the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets. First Data, the largest merchant acquirer in the U.S.,
            helps retailers accept credit- and debit-card payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chiarello was CIO of JPMorgan for about five and a half
            years and held technology roles at New York-based Morgan Stanley
            for 23 years, according to the filing. The Wall Street Journal
            reported in May that Chiarello was leaving JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology and security were among Bisignano's
            responsibilities as co-COO, and he held executive roles within
            the payments industry earlier in his career. Bisignano, 53, was
            Citigroup Inc.'s CEO of global transaction services from 2002 to
            2005 and executive vice president of consumer lending in the
            early 1990s for First Fidelity Bancorp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matt Zames became JPMorgan's sole COO when Bisignano left
            the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan as Biggest Underwriter Sees More Losses: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The chief market strategist at
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's biggest underwriter of
            corporate bonds, says the worst first half of the year on record
            for the securities may only deepen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes have lost 3.7 percent on average since May 22
            when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress the
            central bank may begin curtailing its unprecedented stimulus
            program if economic conditions warrant, Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch index data show. The losses compare with a drop of 2.9
            percent for government securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The performance is a shock to bulls who expected the extra
            yield offered by corporates relative to government bonds to
            cushion any selloff that stemmed from the prospects for higher
            interest rates and a stronger economy. Instead, diminished
            dealer inventories of the securities brought on by regulatory
            changes has caused liquidity to drop, exacerbating the price
            declines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Through a whole set of new, post-crisis regulations, the
            potential buyers do not have the same capacity to absorb credit
            risk,' said Jan Loeys, who heads a global asset allocation
            strategy team at JPMorgan in New York, in a telephone interview.
            'The banks don't have the same ability to absorb this
            anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;

            in portfolios and, by its nature, hard to detect,' the asset
            management unit said in an e-mail to clients, which was seen by
            Bloomberg News. Three funds run by the company had exposure to
            Let's Gowex, according to the e-mail. A JPMorgan press officer
            wasn't immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Let's Gowex announced on Sunday that it would file for
            insolvency and that its chief executive officer had resigned.
            The company's shares dropped 60 percent last week following a
            report by Gotham City Research LLC that said Let's Gowex
            inflated revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the end of June, the stock was a 2.1 percent holding in
            JPMorgan Funds Europe Focus Fund, 2.9 percent in JPMorgan Funds
            Euroland Focus Fund and 0.31 percent in JPMorgan Funds Europe
            Strategic Growth Fund. Trading in the stock has been suspended
            since Thursday. JPMorgan Asset Management said the stock 'for
            the purposes of the portfolios involved, is now subject to
            consideration by the JPMAM Non Standard Pricing Committee.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Hires UBS's David Li as China Head, Replacing Shao</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, hired UBS AG (UBSN)'s former China Chairman David Li to lead
            the Wall Street firm's operations in the Asian nation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As senior country officer for China, Li will be responsible
            for JPMorgan's businesses and products in the country, according
            to the memo, which was confirmed by Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman. Li, who was also previously
            UBS's country
            head for China, will join JPMorgan in October and be based in
            Beijing, the document showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Li replaces Zili Shao, JPMorgan's former China chairman and
            chief executive officer, who was named the bank's Asia-Pacific
            vice chairman in April. Fang Fang, the company's CEO of
            investment banking for China, resigned in March after more than
            12 years at the firm amid an investigation by U.S. regulators
            into its Asian hiring practices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shao, who joined JPMorgan in 2009, oversaw a China
            expansion that included the formation of a domestic securities
            venture, buying stakes in a trust and a guarantee company, and
            establishing a locally incorporated bank. Li spent nine years at
            Zurich-based UBS and helped set up UBS Securities Co., the
            firm's Chinese brokerage venture, of which he was chairman until
            he left the company. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Guyett Asia Co-Head as Esperdy Returns to U.S.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named Greg Guyett co-head of Asia-Pacific banking as part of a management
            shuffle in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guyett will succeed Therese Esperdy, who is returning to
            the U.S. to become global chairman of the financial institutions
            group, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News and
            confirmed by the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes come after a management shuffle in China in the
            wake of a probe by U.S. regulators into JPMorgan's Asian hiring
            practices. Guyett last year was named chief executive of
            JPMorgan's Greater China unit, a position that is being phased
            out. China will now be overseen by UBS AG's former China
            Chairman David Li, who is joining JPMorgan in October as head of
            the firm's operations in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guyett previously ran JPMorgan's Japan business and oversaw
            its global corporate bank. He will oversee investment banking,
            equity markets, and other operations in the Asia-Pacific with
            Tom DuCharme, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esperdy and DuCharme became co-heads of banking for Asia
            Pacific in 2012. Esperdy will return to the U.S., and work with
            the bank's financial services team around the world on cross-border deals, the memo states. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Adding Europe Property Risk as Safe Prices Rise</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset
            management unit intends to quadruple its holdings of European
            commercial property in need of renovations or new tenants as
            well-occupied buildings in good condition become too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company plans to raise its ownership of
            'opportunistic' properties in the region to about 4 billion
            euros ($5.4 billion) over three years, according to Peter Reilly, the company's head of European real
            estate. During that
            time, the New York-based investor will acquire less lower-risk,
            or core, real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the next three years our buying activity will probably
            be 80 percent opportunistic, whereas through 2012 it was 80
            percent core,' Reilly said in an interview. 'Our buy activity
            shifts as the capital market shifts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors like JPMorgan Asset Management, which holds about
            $63 billion of real estate, rushed to the safety of Europe's
            most stable income-producing properties after the financial
            crisis. Firms are now flocking to riskier office buildings,
            shops and warehouses as prices for the safest assets in Europe
            climb to their highest level since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almost 60 percent of investors were searching for riskier
            properties at the end of the first quarter, up from 47 percent a
            year earlier, according to a study by London-based research firm
            Preqin Ltd. The proportion of buyers seeking the highest quality
            buildings with tenants in place dropped to 35 percent from 56
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;International Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management owns about 3 billion euros of
            core properties in Europe, including offices, shops and
            warehouses in the U.K., France and Germany, Reilly said. The
            majority of its property holdings, about $45.5 billion excluding
            real estate investment trusts, is in the U.S. Europe is second
            at about $7.8 billion and Asia trails with around $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buying properties in need of investment to reach their
            earnings potential is easier now because banks are more willing
            to sell underperforming loans tied to real estate than they had
            been in the aftermath of the financial crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Conversations with banks are more productive today than
            they were a couple of years ago,' when there was a big
            difference between asking prices and bids, Reilly said. 'That
            should accelerate through 2015.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks will sell loans with a face value of 83 billion euros
            this year, 30 percent more than in 2013, as they clean up their
            balance sheets to focus on new business, according to data
            compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan unit will focus on buying offices in large
            cities including Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and
            the English cities of Birmingham and Manchester. High prices in
            London make it difficult to find profitable deals there, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We like troubled assets in really good markets,' he
            said. 'So when you fix the asset, you've got a core property.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Investment Bank's 1st-Half Pay Little Changed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and
            investment bank allocated almost the same amount of money for
            employees in the first half from a year earlier as the
            division's revenue climbed 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $6.36 billion in first-half compensation costs
            amounted to 33 percent of revenue, excluding accounting
            adjustments, down from 34 percent in the prior year, according
            to figures posted today on the New York-based firm's website.
            The amount is equal to $122,926 for each of the division's
            51,771 employees in the six months. The unit had 52,336
            employees a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, combined its
            investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and
            securities-services units last year under co-heads Mike Cavanagh, 47, and Daniel Pinto, 50. The group has
            more than
            twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
            years. Figures for average pay don't represent what individuals
            actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Trails Proposed U.S. Capital Rule Dimon Dislikes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s ratio of
            capital to total assets falls short of a proposed U.S. minimum
            that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon criticized for
            diverging from the standard other nations' lenders face. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's so-called leverage ratio at its holding company
            is 4.7 percent, below the 5 percent proposed U.S. minimum, the
            New York-based bank said today in a presentation. The ratio at
            its deposit-taking subsidiary is even lower, creating a wider
            gap to the 6 percent proposed standard for those units, Chief
            Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. plan goes beyond the 3 percent global minimum
            requirement that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
            approved to help prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.
            The changes would make lenders fund more assets with capital
            that can absorb losses instead of using borrowed money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If one is 3 percent and one is 6 percent, that becomes
            just too big, and over time it can have huge competitive
            effects,' Dimon said on the conference call with analysts. 'We
            always ran with higher capital and liquidity than most of our
            competitors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it plans to be in line with the holding
            company standard by the first quarter of 2015. The company plans
            to bring the federally insured bank subsidiary into compliance
            by the end of that year, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dividends &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said it can increase its holding company leverage
            ratio by 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage points, with capital
            generated from earnings through the next six quarters if it
            keeps payouts to shareholders constant. JPMorgan could also
            boost the ratio as much as 1 percentage point by issuing
            preferred shares and making adjustments such as unwinding
            derivative bets, according to the bank's presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon said the company can achieve the new ratios and
            accelerate share buybacks and dividends over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed U.S. rule will add unfunded commitments and
            some derivatives exposure to banks' stated assets. That will
            increase JPMorgan's total assets by about $1 trillion from the
            $2.4 trillion on its balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Basel committee has proposed additional increases to
            asset calculations, which Lake said could have a 'not
            insignificant' impact on the ratio. Lake also said there is a
            'strong argument' that the firm's more than $450 billion of
            cash and highly liquid assets should be excluded from the
            calculation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The leverage ratio provides an additional measure of
            capital to Basel III ratios that weight assets based on risk,
            which results in an asset figure that is half of that under the
            leverage ratio. The firm said its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio
            climbed to 9.3 percent and plans to reach 9.5 percent by the end
            of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the leverage ratio is an appropriate
            complement to a Tier 1 common ratio, if properly calibrated,'
            Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, posted second-quarter profit that beat estimates
            as fixed-income trading revenue fell less than analysts expected. The stock climbed the most in eight
            months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income declined 7.9 percent to $5.99 billion, or $1.46 a share, from $6.5
            billion, or $1.60, a year earlier, the New York-based firm said today in a statement. Earnings excluding
            some items were $1.59 a share, topping the $1.31 average estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
            Revenue slid 2.3 percent to $25.4 billion from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quarterly results were
            overshadowed by questions about the health of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, who said July 1 that
            he would soon undergo radiation and chemotherapy for throat cancer. While Dimon reiterated today that his
            prognosis is excellent and that he'll be able to work during eight weeks of treatment, the disclosure raised
            fresh questions about succession planning at the bank he's run since 2006. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;/p&gt;

            else was part of a team who reported to him, and there's not a clear second-in-command or frontrunner to

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon plans to be involved running the bank
            at a less intense pace as he fights throat cancer and said that the company is prepared for 'all scenarios.'

            to spend time in his office and take phone calls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan is 'to take it easy,' Dimon
            said. 'It doesn't mean not to work at all, but to focus on my health.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 58, raised
            fresh questions about succession planning at the New York-based bank when he announced the diagnosis July 1.
            He said today that Lee Raymond, the company's lead director, is available if managers need guidance while
            Dimon is unavailable and that the board already had protocols in place for succession planning. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has created the
            first U.S. index of its type to measure returns of
            collateralized loan obligations, which are on pace for a record
            year of issuance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CLOIE gauge will be available for use today, according
            to Gloria Kim, the head of global index research at the bank in
            New York. The measure will allow users to track the price and
            total return of CLOs and their debt portions, according to the
            bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan forecasts that as much as a record $100 billion of
            the funds that bundle junk-rated loans into securities with
            ratings as high as AAA may be sold in the U.S. this year. There
            has been $66.6 billion arranged in 2014, according to data from
            the bank. CLOs helped finance some of the biggest leveraged
            buyouts during the last credit boom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is the 'first time anyone has tried to create a
            realistic index with rules that track the price performance and
            total return' of CLOs, Rishad Ahluwalia, global head of CLO
            research at JPMorgan in London, said in a telephone interview.
            'We want to challenge the market to improve transparency and
            while this will evolve over time, we want to help move it
            forward as the market develops.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CLOIE tracks floating-rate CLO securities for deals
            dating back to 2004, according to information from the bank.
            Additional sub-indexes are divided by ratings AAA through BB.
            Pricing for the index is provided by PricingDirect Inc., an
            affiliate of JPMorgan, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Transparent Benchmark' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For a while we wanted to create a transparent benchmark
            for investors that tracked returns,' Ahluwalia said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The AAA rated portion of CLOs raised after the credit
            crisis has returned 1.07 percent this year, according to the
            JPMorgan CLOIE Index. That compares with 0.31 percent for all of
            2013 and 3.86 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CLO measure follows the introduction of the JPMorgan
            Asset-Backed Securities Indices in 2013, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CLOs pool high-yield corporate loans and slice them into
            securities of varying risk and return, typically from AAA
            ratings down to B. The lowest portion, known as the equity
            tranche, offers the highest potential returns and the greatest
            risk because investors are the first to see their interest
            payouts reduced when loans backing the CLO default. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Nearing FERC Market-Rigging Settlement, WSJ Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, is near a deal with the Federal Energy Regulatory
            Commission to settle allegations that the lender rigged
            electricity markets, the Wall Street Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, which would resolve claims that the bank
            manipulated power prices in California and the Midwest, could
            require the largest payout in the agency's history, according to
            the report, which cited people familiar with the discussions.
            Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, and
            Mary O'Driscoll, a FERC spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Previous negotiations between JPMorgan and the regulator
            involved a payout figure close to $1 billion, according to the
            Wall Street Journal. A deal could cost the bank $500 million,
            the New York Times reported today, citing people briefed on the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC warned JPMorgan in March that its personnel and two
            subsidiaries may face claims stemming from a probe into its
            bidding practices, according to a regulatory disclosure from the
            bank in May. Claims may include 'alleged violations of FERC
            rules and the rules of certain independent system operators,'
            the lender said at the time, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has stepped up scrutiny of
            corporations as the agency wields policing powers that were
            expanded in the wake of Enron Corp.'s 2001 collapse.
            Wellinghoff, whose term was due to expire June 30, submitted his
            resignation in May. President Barack Obama asked him to stay
            until a new commissioner is confirmed by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday the regulator ordered Barclays Plc (BARC) and four
            former traders to pay a combined $487.9 million in fines and
            penalties for engaging in what the agency said was a scheme to
            manipulate energy markets in the Western U.S. from November 2006
            to December 2008. London-based Barclays said it would
            'vigorously' fight the penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Agency investigators may seek to hold JPMorgan traders and
            commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters 'individually liable,'
            the New York Times reported in May, citing a 70-page document
            the watchdog sent the bank in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FERC revoked a JPMorgan unit's right to trade power for
            six months in November after accusing the firm of providing
            misleading information to a California energy authority. The
            suspension, which took effect in April, marked the first such
            sanction for an active market participant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG is among companies that have settled with
            FERC. The Frankfurt-based lender agreed on Jan. 22 to pay $1.6
            million to resolve FERC claims that an energy-trading unit
            manipulated markets in 2010. The bank, Germany's biggest, didn't
            admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Gets $37 Million of Crisis-Era Options</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will let Jamie Dimon collect about $37 million in stock options created
            during the financial crisis, as the board stands by its leader after risk-management lapses and billions of
            dollars in legal settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave the chief executive officer 2 million
            stock-appreciation rights in January 2008, saying they would be available in five years if the board still
            deemed it appropriate. Last year, the firm delayed vesting by 18 months to address flawed internal controls
            exposed by botched derivatives bets. JPMorgan resolved a variety of probes in the months that followed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board 'decided not to further defer the vesting of these options at the July 2014 meeting,' Joe
            Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said today after the vesting of the grant was
            disclosed in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the package's creation, JPMorgan has become the
            nation's largest lender, acquiring Bears Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.'s bank units at the height
            of the crisis. As Dimon, 58, navigated the regulatory setbacks, the board signaled support for his work as
            CEO and chairman, boosting his pay 74 percent to $20 million in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The options
            have a $39.83 strike price and expire in January 2018. JPMorgan's stock closed today at $57.86, giving the
            award a value of about $37 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, HSBC, BAML Said to Manage Buenos Aires Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., HSBC Holdings
            Plc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch were hired by the city of
            Buenos Aires to sell as much as $890 million of global bonds,
            according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's capital city said it received approval from
            local lawmakers to sell debt with a minimum maturity of five
            years. The funds will be used to pay down $475 million of debt
            coming due in 2015 and extend maturities, said the people, who
            asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to
            speak publicly about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks handling the sale are waiting for the right
            moment to sell the debt, the people said. There's no date
            scheduled for meetings to promote the sale, according to one of
            the people, who is an official at the city's Finance Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
            comment. BAML officials couldn't be reached. HSBC press official
            Robert Sherman didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This would be the city of Buenos Aires' first international
            bond sale since 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentine companies and provinces are waiting for lower
            interest rates to sell as much as $2 billion of bonds later this
            year, according to Puente Sociedad de Bolsa SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While average yields hit three-year lows last week, the
            government faces a July 30 deadline to settle with holdout
            creditors or fall into default on restructured debt. U.S.
            District Court judge blocked a $539 million payment due June 30,
            saying it violated his orders to pay defaulted bondholders at
            the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The city's 12.5 percent notes due next year fell 0.38 cent
            to 101.53 cents on the dollar at 12:51 p.m. in Buenos Aires,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield rose 55 basis
            points, or 0.55 percentage point, to 10.14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan in Rules Dispute Cedes Loan Share to Nonbanks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the behemoths of the U.S. mortgage market, are
            surrendering more business to nonbank lenders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nation's two largest originators made
            21 percent of home loans in the second quarter, the smallest combined share in more than a decade, down from
            30 percent a year ago, according to regulatory filings. They're ceding ground to companies like Quicken
            Loans Inc., which grabbed the No. 3 spot from Bank of America Corp. in the first quarter, and LoanDepot.com
            LLC, whose share surged more than three-fold in the following period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big banks are
            exercising caution to avoid losses if their home loans sour and government-controlled Fannie Mae or Freddie
            Mac force them to repurchase the mortgages. This week, JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon escalated the buyback issue
            between lenders and the government, saying he questioned whether his bank should end its decades-old
            relationship with the Federal Housing Administration, a last resort for lower-income Americans seeking
            mortgages. Nonbank lenders, hungry for mortgages to service, are expanding rapidly to fill the void left by
            banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Mortgage banking may just be a smaller players' game now,' said Paul Miller, a
            banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia. 'They're able to be more flexible.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the No. 2 U.S. mortgage lender, reported this week that its second-quarter
            originations fell 66 percent to $16.8 billion, the lowest quarterly result since at least 2005, compared
            with the year-ago period. The New York-based bank's share of the market dropped to 5.4 percent in the second
            quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, from 8.1 percent in the first period. JPMorgan's market
            share averaged 10 percent in the prior five years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Threat &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much
            of the decline came from a falloff in FHA lending, Dimon said on the bank's call with analysts. Banks have
            been in a dispute with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA over rules that force the firms to repurchase
            mortgages that go bad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our FHA volume was way down and we studied FHA and based upon
            the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that we've lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA,' Dimon said.
            'The real question to me is should we be in the FHA business at all and we're still struggling with that.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's loss of market share is part of its long-term plan to pull back from the
            mortgage business and focus on making loans to the most creditworthy borrowers, said Miller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wells
            Drops &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They're making a strategic decision to shrink,' Miller said. 'They don't want to
            do marginal loans they could end up paying the piper on. They're saying we paid a lot of money and we're
            done with it.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo last week reported that originations fell 58 percent to $47
            billion from a year earlier, the lowest second-quarter result in more than a decade. The San Francisco-based
            bank's market share declined to 15.2 percent in the second quarter, based on data compiled by Bloomberg,
            from 15.9 percent in the first period. The bank's share averaged 23 percent in the prior five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said on a conference call last week that the bank
            wants to lend to more borrowers even if they don't have pristine credit. He said Wells Fargo just needs
            clarity about what triggers a buyback demand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank executives are having meetings with
            Melvin L. Watt, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, about the rules, Stumpf said. FHFA
            oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, known as government-sponsored enterprises. Earlier this year, Watt
            introduced a sunset provision so lenders are not responsible in some cases if loans go sour after three
            years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;LoanDepot Advantage &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You have low rates on one side
            encouraging borrowing and you have put-backs from the GSEs on the other side that make lenders less willing
            to lend money,' Stumpf said. 'The goal is to get more credit appropriately to borrowers who want to own
            homes and who can afford homes.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonbank lenders like LoanDepot.com that started after
            the housing crash in 2007 or didn't make subprime loans are not burdened with the buyback issue, said
            Anthony Hsieh, chief executive officer of LoanDepot.com. The online lender, which is backed by
            private-equity firm Parthenon Capital Partners, began in 2010 in compliance with new mortgage regulations
            compared with established banks that had to adapt to the changes, Hsieh said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We had a
            clean canvas to build our organization post crisis in a new world of much heavier regulatory scrutiny,' said
            Hsieh, a former president of LendingTree.com. 'The biggest banks have a much smaller footprint than before
            and that creates a lot of opportunity for nonbank lenders.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Share Soars &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LoanDepot.com, which collects payments on the majority of mortgages it makes, originated $3 billion
            in loans in the second quarter, a 58 percent jump from a year earlier, according to Hsieh. The Foothill
            Ranch, California-based firm's market share rose more than threefold to 1.1 percent in the second period,
            Hsieh said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hsieh said the firm is selling products that are compliant with qualified
            mortgage guidelines, such as debt-to-income ratios below 43 percent. The company will soon announce an
            offering for loans without government backing to help sustain its rapid growth, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stonegate
            Mortgage Corp. (SGM), which was founded by Jim Cutillo and his wife Barbara in 2005, survived the subprime
            meltdown by avoiding these risky loans. The Indianapolis-based firm has been ratcheting up its market share
            by expanding to states such as California and Virginia, said Cutillo, who was a director for GMAC
            Residential Funding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wholesale Business &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender and servicer,
            whose biggest investor is private-equity firm Long Ridge Equity Partners, last year hired a team from
            Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. to expand its wholesale business -- lending through mortgage brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's mortgage origination volume, which includes FHA loans, jumped 27 percent to $2.4
            billion in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Cutillo plans to build the firm's business in
            jumbo loans in places like Washington with more expensive real estate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If all the big
            players were deconsolidating and some small and mid-sized players didn't have enough capital to build size
            and scale in any industry, wouldn't you think there would be a huge opportunity?' Cutillo said. 'We're
            arbitraging that and filling a big void the banks have left.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Refinance Plunge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaza Home Mortgage Inc. mostly provides wholesale lending -- a business that banks like Wells
            Fargo exited. Plaza Home Mortgage has been able to increase its originations by working with brokers who
            focus on purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's paid off as refinancing has waned, said Kevin Parra, Plaza's
            co-founder. Refinancing, a traditional mainstay for banks, fell in April to the lowest level since 2008,
            according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The San Diego-based firm benefits from
            established relationships with mortgage brokers who in turn work with local realtors, Parra said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As the market has moved from refis to purchases, service becomes a bigger factor, and brokers will
            use us because they know us and trust we will get them to close on time,' said Parra. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plaza
            Home originated $1 billion in mortgages for purchases in the second quarter compared with $780 million a
            year earlier, and increased its total market share to 0.6 percent, said Parra. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            market-share gain of small lenders is increasing financial risks for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according
            to a report yesterday from the FHFA's Office of Inspector General. The companies, which were on the brink of
            insolvency in 2008 and seized by the government, buy mortgages from lenders and package them into securities
            that are sold to investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Limited Capacity' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Some smaller
            lenders and nonbank mortgage companies have limited financial capacity,' the report said. If loans later
            prove to have errors in them, the companies may lack the ability to make good on buyback demands, resulting
            in losses for taxpayers, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have recovered almost $100
            billion from lenders stemming from buyback demands since the 2008 financial crisis, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks may focus more on mortgage lending once there's more clarity around buybacks and the housing
            recovery regains momentum, said Hsieh of LoanDepot.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Wells will always be the 800
            pound gorilla, but the nonbank upstarts will make headway and some will be here to stay,' said FBR's Miller.

        <headline>U.K. Hires JPMorgan to Provide Bank-Privatization Advice</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM),
            whose senior advisers include former Prime Minister Tony Blair,
            as it accelerates efforts to reduce its stakes in Lloyds Banking
            Group Plc (LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan Cazenove will provide ad hoc input which will
            complement UKFI's expertise in devising strategies for realizing
            value for the government's shareholdings in the banks,' U.K.
            Financial Investments Ltd., the body that oversees the
            government's stakes in the lenders, said in a statement today.
            'This appointment does not involve any commitment in relation
            to other roles at any other time and UKFI intends to review this
            appointment on a periodic basis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UKFI also named a panel of 11 banks including Barclays Plc (BARC)
            and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. eligible to be selected as
            bookrunners in future stock offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said last month
            the U.K. government is 'actively considering' selling shares
            in Lloyds. RBS's return to private ownership is still some way
            off because it's weighed down by too many poor assets, he told
            financiers in his Mansion House speech in London on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyds shares exceed the level at which the government says
            it will break even on its 39 percent holding after providing a
            20 billion-pound ($30 billion) rescue almost five years ago. The
            stock was down 1 percent at 69.34 pence by 11:26 a.m. in London,
            surpassing the 61 pence break-even price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Osborne said last month the first block of government
            shares in Lloyds will probably be sold to institutional
            investors as 'the most effective way of managing risk and
            getting value.' The government will consider an offering to
            individual investors at a later stage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBS is trading at 336.8 pence, below the 407 pence the
            Treasury says it will break even on its 45.5 billion-pound
            investment in the 81 percent government-owned lender. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Risk Committee Cut in Half as Futter, Cote Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co., the largest
            U.S. bank, said Ellen V. Futter and David M. Cote, two of the
            firm's four risk-committee members, left the board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural
            History, is leaving after 16 years with the bank, while
            Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Chief Executive Officer Cote, 62,
            is retiring after more than five, the New York-based firm said
            yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cote and Futter were among three risk committee members who
            narrowly won re-election to the board in May, overcoming
            opposition from some shareholders after a London unit's loss of
            more than $6 billion exposed risk-management failures. None of
            the three had worked at a bank or as financial risk managers,
            Bloomberg News reported in May 2012. A fourth was added to the
            committee after the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am proud to have served as a member of JPMorgan Chase's
            board during such a historic time,' Futter, 63, said in the
            statement. She was the only director who didn't attend the
            annual shareholder meeting in May. She was re-elected with 53
            percent of the vote, the smallest margin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think she just got tired of the criticism,' John H. Biggs, who served as a JPMorgan director
            with Futter until 2007,
            said in an interview. 'She was long on judgment but short on
            technical knowledge, and that's OK by me.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Haniel Said to Hire JPMorgan to Explore Celesio Options</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Franz Haniel Cie GmbH, a family-owned holding company in Germany, is exploring options including
            a sale of its entire stake in German pharmaceutical retailer
            Celesio AG (CLS1), according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Haniel has hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to advise on the sale
            of a full or partial stake or a partnership with another
            company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
            talks are private. The process remains at an early stage and
            Haniel could decide against a sale of its 50 percent stake in
            the Stuttgart-based company, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Celesio shares surged 9.3 percent to 17.70 euros at the
            close in Frankfurt, the biggest gain in a month. The stock has
            climbed 36 percent so far this year, giving the company a market
            value of 3 billion euros ($4 billion), amid speculation the
            company could be sold. Celesio Chief Executive Officer Markus Pinger was fired this month after he hired
            Citigroup Inc. to
            advise on a potential deal, people familiar with the situation
            said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since Walgreen Co. (WAG), the largest U.S. drugstore chain,
            agreed in 2012 to buy a 45 percent stake of U.K. pharmacy owner
            Alliance Boots, drug wholesalers have been examining their
            positions in Europe and ways to reduce costs. A possible Celesio
            sale comes as medical expenses rise and governments cut spending
            in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Potential Suitors &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Celesio has attracted interest from at least three
            companies, one of the people said. McKesson Corp. (MCK), the largest
            U.S. drug distributor, and U.S. competitor Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH)
            are among potential buyers, one of the people said. Celesio and
            CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) have held talks on a possible collaboration,
            including purchasing pacts, rather than an acquisition, the
            person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Haniel spokesman in Duisburg, Germany, said it's company
            policy not to comment on market speculation. Representatives of
            Celesio, JPMorgan and CVS Caremark declined to comment. McKesson
            and Cardinal Health couldn't be immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Picks Lakos-Bujas as Head of U.S. Equity Strategy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. named Dubravko Lakos-Bujas as the head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy,
            assuming the role last held by Thomas Lee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lakos-Bujas will lead a team of analysts in
            covering the broad stock market and use mathematical models to analyze trends and find trading opportunities
            for JPMorgan clients. He will continue to report to Marko Kolanovic, global head of macro derivative and
            systematic strategies, according to a statement from the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            strategist joins almost two dozen Wall Street forecasters who try to predict the direction of the stock
            market and advise investors on their equity holdings. The average estimate for the year-end level of the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index is 1,986, based on a Bloomberg News survey of banks and brokerages, implying the
            equity benchmark will be little changed from now to December. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lakos-Bujas has worked as
            a quantitative analyst focusing on global markets at JPMorgan and spent six years at Deutsche Bank AG's
            asset management division, according to the statement from JPMorgan. He was third-ranked quantitative
            analyst in Institutional Investor's survey last year. Lee, who held the job since 2007, left earlier this
            year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Debt-Trading Clients Widen Business as JPMorgan Leads Survey</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) had the biggest
            U.S. fixed-income market share as trading clients expand the
            number of dealers they do business with, Greenwich Associates
            said in an annual survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which held the top spot in a similar survey in
            2011 before dropping to third last year, has an 11.4 percent
            market share, Greenwich Associates said today, citing a study it
            conducted based on interviews with 1,027 active institutional
            investors in the U.S. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) dropped to fifth
            from second last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buy-side clients are spreading their business as Wall
            Street banks are scaling back in product areas in which they
            aren't leaders, Greenwich said. Banks including Morgan Stanley (MS)
            and UBS AG (UBSN) are shedding assets in fixed-income trading and
            seeking to cut costs amid sluggish revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For many institutional investors, these strategic shifts
            have resulted in disruptions in sell-side coverage and a
            reduction in market liquidity as dealers pull back capital,
            consolidate desks, reduce headcount and replace senior fixed-income professionals with younger, less
            experienced and cheaper
            talent,' Stamford, Connecticut-based Greenwich said in the
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
            had the three largest market shares behind JPMorgan. Greenwich
            said the four firms were in a statistical tie for first. The
            study focused on activity with clients, rather than trading
            revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Revenue Up &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nine largest banks generated about $90 billion in
            fixed-income trading revenue globally in 2012, excluding some
            accounting charges, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            That was up 14 percent from 2011, and accounted for more than
            half of all revenue from trading and investment banking at the
            firms, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, has the largest market
            share in trading rate products such as government bonds and
            interest-rate derivatives, according to Greenwich. Deutsche
            Bank, JPMorgan and Citigroup (C) joined the Swiss bank in a
            statistical tie. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had the biggest share in
            credit products, such as corporate bonds and leveraged loans.
            Barclays Plc (BARC), Credit Suisse and Bank of America had the largest
            share in securitized products, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup was the share leader in municipal bonds, with New
            York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup leading in emerging-market
            trading, Greenwich said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The study took place between February and April, Greenwich
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seen Facing Bigger Fight With Mortgage Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) may need to pay
            more than the $4.5 billion it offered to settle investor claims
            over faulty mortgages packaged into securities before the U.S.
            housing crash, a report prepared for bond trustees shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trustees should reject the accord struck last November with
            a group of bondholders for 16 of the 330 deals included, and
            it's a 'close call' for three others, according to the report
            posted online this week by Daniel Fischel, president of Compass
            Lexecon, which is among firms hired by the securities
            administrators to help evaluate the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Based on the reports by the expert advisors, there exists
            a meaningful possibility that trustees may not accept the
            proposed settlement offer for all 330 trusts,' Nomura Holdings
            Inc. analysts including Paul Nikodem and Pratik K. Gupta wrote
            yesterday in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan negotiated the proposed settlement with 21
            institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Pacific
            Investment Management Co. in a bid to move past legal troubles
            tied in part to the housing crisis. The accord was announced the
            week before the largest U.S. bank agreed to a record $13 billion
            settlement with government agencies over faulty mortgage
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Extended Deadline &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trustees including Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo Co. and
            Bank of New York Mellon Corp. must decide whether to accept
            JPMorgan's proposal by Aug. 1. The deadline has been pushed back
            at least twice from an original date of March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment, as did Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo, Kevin Heine of Bank of New York and Renee Calabro of
            Deutsche Bank.
            Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs Bruns LLP representing the
            investors who negotiated the deal, didn't immediately respond to
            an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to
            continue separate lawsuits over some of the securities. Law firm
            Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Sullivan LLP is also representing a
            group of investors objecting to the agreement for at least some
            deals, according to Fischel, also a professor of law and
            business emeritus at the University of Chicago Law School. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Improper Servicing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord sparked claims that JPMorgan and Bear Stearns
            Cos., which it bought in 2008, needed to repurchase mortgages
            whose quality was misrepresented, as well as pay for mishandling
            loans once they're made. Another expert, Boston Portfolio
            Advisors Inc., said in its report the improper servicing boosted
            losses by $4 billion and disclosed that many of the loans are
            already managed by a separate 'subservicer,' limiting the
            benefits to investors of transfers to such entities as called
            for by the deal, according to Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank, has
            faced opposition in court over an $8.5 billion settlement that
            it reached in 2011 with bondholders represented by Gibbs Bruns
            and Bank of New York, as the trustee for more than 500
            transactions. A New York state judge largely approved the deal
            in January, though the ruling is being appealed by investors
            seeking a bigger payout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said this month it
            would pay $650 million to American International Group Inc., one
            of the objectors to the agreement that had also filed a separate
            suit over mortgage securities created by Countrywide Financial
            Corp., the lender bought by Bank of America in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No 'Windfall' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the proposed JPMorgan settlement is relatively small,
            compared with other mortgage-bond agreements, evidence from
            markets suggest that it wouldn't be a 'windfall' for the bank,
            Fischel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount offered represents 6.6 percent of past and
            potential losses on loans underlying the bonds, compared with
            10.8 percent in the Bank of America deal, Barclays Plc analysts
            estimated in November. After a $55 million payment by Wells
            Fargo to an individual bond trust this year, investors recovered
            32 percent of past and future losses, according to Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fatan Sabry, an economist at National Economic Research
            Associates Inc., wrote in a report for trustees that JPMorgan's
            planned payment exceeds potential losses from violations of so-called representation and warranties under
            several estimation
            methods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anthony J. Carpinello, a former New York State Supreme
            Court justice, said in a report that the statute of limitations
            for all the 330 deals has been extended, which could bolster any
            separate demands from investors reluctant to take part in the
            accord, according to Nomura. JPMorgan contends that the
            extension only applies to some of the deals, according to a
            website set up by trustees. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley to JPMorgan Said to Keep Trading With SAC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan (JPM)
            Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley are among Wall Street banks
            continuing to trade with SAC Capital Advisors LP after U.S.
            prosecutors indicted the hedge fund for insider trading,
            according to four people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms are still providing trading and prime brokerage
            services to the hedge fund founded by Steven A. Cohen, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified talking about a specific
            client. The government has no plan to freeze fund assets,
            prevent redemptions or affect interests of SAC counterparties,
            Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC said yesterday after the
            government's criminal charges were made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have been grappling with the reputational and
            financial consequences of continuing their dealings with SAC,
            one of Wall Street's largest trading clients. The $14 billion
            hedge fund was indicted for perpetrating what prosecutors called
            an unprecedented insider-trading scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You're always between a rock and a hard place when you're
            the credit guy trying to decide to what to do,' said James Rickards, senior managing director at Tangent
            Capital Partners
            LLC and former general counsel at Long-Term Capital Management
            LP, which was one of the world's biggest hedge funds before
            losing $4 billion in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have to ask themselves 'what is the risk that I lose
            money? What is the risk that they get into stress and I don't
            get paid? What is the risk that the regulator criticizes me or
            my reputation is tarnished?' Rickards said. 'The other side is
            I like the commissions and I want to be a stand-up guy, and I
            don't want to be perceived as a guy who cut and run.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Protective Measures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether other lenders including Goldman Sachs (GS)
            Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Citigroup Inc. (C) had changed any
            of their dealings with SAC. Spokesmen for the banks declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks may continue to deal with the hedge-fund firm while
            protecting themselves by reducing credit limits, requiring more
            collateral and halting trades in over-the-counter products, said
            Rickards, who was a credit officer at Greenwich Capital Markets
            when junk-bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. collapsed
            in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a lot of things you can do between doing nothing
            and cutting them off completely to improve your position,' said
            Rickards. 'If everyone hangs together, and everyone does some
            common-sense things, it's business as usual. But if one domino
            falls, the rest of them will fall very quickly, and that's why
            everyone is on eggshells.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Allegations Denied &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAC denied it encouraged or tolerated insider trading and
            said it will continue to operate as it works through the
            allegations. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an
            administrative complaint against Cohen last week, seeking to ban
            him from overseeing investor funds for allegedly failing to
            supervise employees and prevent them from engaging in insider
            trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;No major financial-services firm has survived a criminal
            indictment in the U.S. While Cohen has vowed to keep open the
            most successful equity hedge-fund manager, clients have already
            pulled billions from its funds. SAC Capital said in a regulatory
            filing this week that it managed $13.9 billion of net assets as
            of July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hedge fund has been among the largest trading clients
            for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs, according
            to people with knowledge of the relationships. SAC has used
            those firms, along with JPMorgan, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
            Barclays Plc (BARC), as prime brokers, Reuters reported in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reputational Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the world's biggest banks have been emphasizing
            their efforts to behave ethically, put clients first, cooperate
            with regulators and temper risk-taking after reputations were
            damaged during the credit crisis, government-funded bailouts and
            scandals throughout the financial industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is definitely reputational risk at this point that
            didn't exist before as a result of the indictment,' Rickards
            said. 'I know we're innocent until proven guilty, and I respect
            that, but there's no requirement that a counterparty be good to
            the last drop. You're allowed to make sensible business
            decisions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;EON SE (EOAN), Germany's largest utility,
            sold a stake in its Anacacho wind farm in Texas to JPMorgan
            Chase Co. for $76.6 million and a commitment for future
            funding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank bought a 'partial interest' and will make
            further capital contributions, EON Climate Renewables North
            America, a subsidiary of the Dusseldorf-based company, said in a
            statement today. Matt Tulis, an EON spokesman, declined to say
            how large a stake was sold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The tax-equity financing gives JPMorgan a share of the
            project's 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour production tax credit, Tulis
            said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused of Energy-Market Manipulation by U.S. Agency</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) manipulated power markets in California and the Midwest from September
            2010 to June 2011, obtaining tens of millions of dollars in overpayments from grid operators, the U.S.
            Federal Energy Regulatory Commission alleged today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agency said in a Notice of
            Alleged Violations that it had preliminarily determined a JPMorgan trading unit had engaged in eight
            manipulative bidding strategies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank has agreed to sanctions
            including a fine of about $400 million in a settlement that may be announced as early as tomorrow, according
            to a person familiar with the case who asked not to be identified because the terms aren't yet public. Other
            sanctions may include forfeiting profits, this person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan
            spokesman, declined to comment on the FERC action. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case marks another setback for
            the biggest U.S.-based bank, which sailed through the 2008 financial crisis without a single quarterly loss.
            Last year JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion from wrong-way derivatives bets placed by traders in London.
            The incident prompted a U.S. Senate investigation, the departure of two senior executives and a debate over
            whether Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon should keep his chairman role. In May shareholders re-elected
            him as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Cut Support Jobs Amid Trading Slump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender, is cutting hundreds of technology support
            employees in its corporate and investment bank amid a revenue decline, people with knowledge of the move
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Workers in locations including New York, Tampa, Chicago and Dubai were notified of
            the cuts this month, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren't authorized to
            discuss the matter. Luke Moranda, a managing director in charge of clearing technology, and Dan Cronin, an
            executive director, were among those let go, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms are
            trimming expenses by paring support employees and moving personnel to lower-cost locales amid a decline in
            fixed-income trading. JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, run by Daniel Pinto, posted a 12 percent
            revenue drop to $17.6 billion in the first six months of 2014, while noninterest expenses declined by 1.6
            percent to $11.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses
            and operating as efficiently as possible across our businesses,' Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said

        <headline>JPMorgan Filed Inaccurate Large Trader Reports, CFTC Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will pay
            $650,000 to settle U.S. regulatory claims that the bank
            repeatedly filed inaccurate reports about its clients'
            derivatives trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's brokerage unit, JPMorgan Securities LLC, filed
            reports between 2012 and this year with hundreds of errors about
            clients' futures and options trades, the Commodity Futures
            Trading Commission said in a statement today. The unit continued
            to file inaccurate reports even after the agency flagged the
            errors to the bank, the CFTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The large trader reports are vital to the CFTC's role in
            monitoring market behavior,' Aitan Goelman, the CFTC's director
            of enforcement, said in the statement. 'The CFTC will be
            vigilant in enforcing these rules in order to ensure the
            integrity of the regulatory structure and to maintain
            transparency in the markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined immediate
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CFTC requires futures brokers to submit daily reports,
            which it uses to assess large traders' activities and to
            determine whether they hold speculative positions that exceed
            regulatory limits. The data is also included in weekly reports
            on aggregate market activities that are then disclosed to the
            public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been penalized for inaccurate trade reporting
            before. The firm was among at least three dealers to be
            sanctioned this year by the Financial Industry Regulatory
            Authority for not properly reporting trades to bond-price system
            known as Trace. The bank neglected to post trades or missed
            deadlines in at least 6,300 instances over a two-year period,
            Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holding back information on trades can give Wall Street
            dealers an advantage over customers seeking a fair price,
            undermining Finra's stated goal of equal access for all
            participants to real-time data. &lt;/p&gt;

            allegations that the bank manipulated power markets, enriching itself at the expense of consumers in
            California and the Midwest from 2010 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay a U.S. civil
            penalty of $285 million and return $125 million in ill-gotten profits to electricity ratepayers, according
            to a FERC order today. JPMorgan also agreed to give up claims to $262 million worth of disputed payments
            from California's grid operator, the state authority said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're

        <headline>JPMorgan Energy Traders Spur Inquiries From Agencies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) energy traders
            who avoided individual penalties in a $410 million settlement
            with a federal regulator may face action by other agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal and state agencies are free to pursue penalties
            against the bank's employees if they choose, Jon Wellinghoff,
            chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said today
            in an interview. He said the FERC would cooperate with other
            agencies, which he didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have had some discussions with some agencies that I
            can't disclose at this time,' Wellinghoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by market value, agreed
            today to pay $410 million to resolve FERC accusations that its
            traders manipulated power markets in California and the Midwest
            from 2010 to 2012. The agency decided not to pursue sanctions
            against individuals, though it named them in the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The decision was made to move forward in this case from a
            standpoint of expeditiously settling the matter' not to punish
            individuals, Wellinghoff said. The FERC has previously reached
            agreements to end an investigation without sanctioning
            individuals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asked in a separate interview with Bloomberg Television
            today if he was aware of any investigations being conducted by
            other agencies, the FERC chairman said he knew of none. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan traders Francis Dunleavy, Andrew Kittell and John
            Bartholomew are still employed with the bank, according to the
            FERC settlement documents. They worked in JPMorgan's commodities
            unit, run by Blythe Masters, the FERC order showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lawful Conduct &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, Kittell and Bartholomew didn't settle with the
            commission. The agency decided not to sanction them after they
            explained to the commission that their conduct was lawful,
            according to a statement from Gibson, Dunn Crutcher LLP, the
            law firm representing them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The commission's decision to voluntarily settle with
            JPMorgan and not proceed against the individuals can only be
            read as the commission correctly concluding that no case or
            findings against the individuals could be sustained in a court
            of law,' William Scherman, their lawyer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He declined to comment on Wellinghoff's interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steven Greenlee, a spokesman for the California Independent
            System Operator, declined to comment whether the state grid
            authority was conducting its own investigation or has received
            any inquiries from government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC on July 16 announced $18 million in civil penalties
            for four former traders for Barclays Plc (BARC), over allegations of
            market manipulation. The sanctions were part of $488 million in
            fines and penalties levied at Barclays and the individuals,
            which the bank has vowed to fight. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Ferry to Head FX Compliance Team</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, named Andrew Ferry to lead a compliance team focused
            on foreign exchange and rates markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ferry, 46, who previously was in charge of swaps for
            Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was promoted to oversee the
            newly created team in London, said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman
            for the New York-based firm. Tom Prickett, formerly a senior
            trader in the Sterling swaps business, took over Ferry's earlier
            duties, Marchiony said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators and prosecutors in the U.S. and Britain are
            investigating allegations the world's biggest banks, including
            JPMorgan, colluded to rig the foreign-currency rates. JPMorgan
            also agreed this week to pay $650,000 to settle the Commodity
            Futures Trading Commission's claim that it repeatedly filed
            inaccurate reports about clients' derivatives trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ferry didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
            comment. The Wall Street Journal reported the moves earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused by Siena Prosecutors in Monte Paschi Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Siena prosecutors accused JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and at least one of its employees of obstructing
            regulators as part of a wider probe into Banca Monte dei Paschi
            di Siena SpA's purchase of Banca Antonveneta SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege an unidentified person at JPMorgan
            Securities Ltd., a unit of the New York-based bank, withheld
            information from regulators about a 1 billion-euro ($1.3
            billion) financing arranged for Monte Paschi's takeover of
            Antonveneta in 2008, a July 30 court filing obtained by
            Bloomberg News showed. The U.S. bank failed to oversee its
            employees properly, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan arranged a sale of bonds exchangeable into shares
            of Monte Paschi to finance the deal. The lender, which benefited
            from the alleged crime by earning commissions, didn't inform the
            Bank of Italy that it signed a so-called indemnity agreement
            with Monte Paschi, protecting JPMorgan from potential losses
            linked to the securities, according to prosecutors. By hiding
            the agreement, Monte Paschi (BMPS) was able to count the funding as
            equity instead of debt and boost capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The documents mark the final stage before the authorities
            can request formal indictments, and it brings them a step closer
            to reconstructing how Monte Paschi's former managers allegedly
            colluded to misrepresent the lender's finances in the years
            before it sought a government bailout. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Commodity-Tied Note Sales Climb to Largest With Add-On</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $195
            million of structured notes tied to an index of commodity
            futures, the largest such note in more than three and a half
            years after the size was increased twice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four-year securities, $40 million of which were issued
            on July 23, yield the gains and losses of the Dow Jones-UBS
            Commodity Index 3 Month Forward Total Return minus a fee with
            all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the
            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank originally
            sold $65 million of the notes on Nov. 18, 2010, and an
            additional $90 million on Feb. 28 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones-UBS benchmark, which tracks natural gas and
            19 other commodities, declined 9.4 percent this year to 546.7 at
            the close of trading yesterday. The index would have to rise
            more than 8 percent from the day the securities were most
            recently issued in order to reach the initial level from
            November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'America's power needs are only increasing with
            population, as well as the general trend of people moving from
            colder states to the Sun Belt,' said Aaron Calder, senior
            market analyst at Gelber Associates in Houston. U.S.
            regulations could decrease coal production, boosting prices for
            other energy sources, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have bought $760.5 million of commodity-tied
            notes this year, the slowest period since Bloomberg started
            collecting data on the securities in 2010. Globally, banks have
            sold about $2 billion of the securities this year, the least
            since 2004, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
            declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on the
            securities in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. met with
            holders of Argentina's defaulted bonds yesterday to discuss
            buying the securities in a transaction that would allow the
            South American country to resume paying interest on restructured
            notes, according to a bank official familiar with the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The talks, which also involve other banks potentially
            interested in a deal, are ongoing, according to the person, who
            asked not to be identified because the information is private.
            Buenos Aires-based newspaper Ambito reported today that banks
            including JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. were in discussions to buy
            the notes from Elliott Management Corp. and other holders that
            won a court order for full repayment on the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation missed a deadline yesterday to pay $539 million
            in interest, falling into default after two days of negotiations
            in New York failed to produce an accord with Elliott, Aurelius
            Capital Management LP and other creditors from its last default
            in 2001. Aurelius said in a statement that while it has been
            approached by private parties seeking a deal, no agreement has
            been reached. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Aurelius has received no such proposal that we considered
            worthy of serious consideration,' the firm said. 'Much of what
            we have read in the press about such approaches has been, as far
            as we are aware, inaccurate or unreliable.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Morgan Stanley in Losing JBS Business</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The bidding war for Hillshire Brands
            Co. (HSH) is proving costly for the Brazilian bankers at JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After firing Morgan Stanley from a bond sale, Sao Paulo-based JBS SA (JBSS3) pulled JPMorgan from a
            stock offering because the
            two banks are helping Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) counter its bid for
            Hillshire, two people familiar with the situation said, asking
            not to be identified as the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two investment banks are advising Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson in a $6.2 billion offer for
            the maker of Jimmy Dean
            sausages that trumped a $5.6 billion proposal from JBS, the
            world's largest meat producer. The Brazilian company's firing of
            JPMorgan follows at least a dozen bond sales that the bank
            helped manage for JBS since 2006 and a $6.3 billion takeover of
            Bertin SA in 2009 where it acted as one of JBS's advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tyson, the world's No.2 meat producer, announced its bid
            and said it hired the two New York-based banks two days after
            JBS's May 27 offer, saying JPMorgan is also likely to join
            Morgan Stanley (MS) in providing bridge financing for the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jeremiah O'Callaghan, investor relations director for JBS,
            declined to comment, as did Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman
            for Morgan Stanley, andVeronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman
            for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is the No. 2 global deals adviser this year,
            handling $394 billion of announced mergers and acquisitions and
            trailing only Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is fifth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranks second among underwriters of Latin American
            dollar- and euro-denominated bonds in 2014, while Morgan Stanley
            is 10th, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;First IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JBS is seeking regulatory approval to sell shares of its
            JBS Foods SA unit in what would be Brazil's first initial public
            offering this year. Voting shares of the unit holding JBS's
            Brazilian pork, poultry and food-processing operations will be
            listed in Brazil's Novo Mercado subject to regulatory approval
            and market conditions, it said in a May 20 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit was formed after JBS agreed to buy Seara food-processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods
            SA for 5.85 billion
            reais ($2.6 billion) in June 2013. JBS hired units of JPMorgan
            and Banco Bradesco for a 3 billion-real IPO of the unit, two
            people with direct knowledge of the matter said in April. JBS
            also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander SA, Grupo BTG
            Pactual and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the share offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. was helping manage JBS's planned $750
            million bond sale, which the meatpacker has temporarily
            withdrawn as it seeks a new leading coordinator, according to a
            May 29 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reviewing Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of JBS rose 0.8 percent today to 7.56 reais as of
            11:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JBS has spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past
            decade to overtake Tyson in the meat industry. JBS's Pilgrim's
            Pride Corp. unit offered $45 a share for Hillshire, compared
            with Tyson's $50 offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following Tyson's May 29 bid, Pilgrim's is reviewing its
            options, according to a person familiar with the matter. It's
            too early to say whether the company will raise its offer, said
            the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            deliberations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The acquisition of Hillshire, potentially JBS's largest
            takeover since the acquisition of Bertin in 2009, would boost
            the company's debt levels to at least the highest in four years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) may see as much as $1.6 billion go down an Alabama (BEESAL) sewer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets agreed to forgive $842 million of debt owed to it by Jefferson
            County, Alabama, where it took the lead in arranging risky securities deals that pushed the county into the
            largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, in November 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That agreement follows a $722
            million settlement in 2009 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Jefferson County
            financing. JPMorgan's total costs amount to a quarter of the $6.2 billion trading loss in 2012 from
            corporate-credit bets by a trader known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth C. Seymour, a
            bank spokeswoman, had no comment on the accord announced yesterday. If accepted by the court, it would cap
            almost a decade-long fiscal disaster in Alabama's largest county, where JPMorgan initially reaped
            substantial fees arranging interest-rate swaps that subsequently proved tainted by municipal corruption and
            devastating to taxpayers during the 2008 credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Everybody thought there was a
            free lunch and they could all take advantage of it at the same time,' said Christopher Taylor, the former
            executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. 'It burned them all.' &lt;/p&gt;

            Co. (JPM), won court approval of the rough terms of a plan to
            reorganize and will seek final approval July 15 to exit
            bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Grossman yesterday approved
            MModal's disclosure statement, which explains how much creditors
            will get. The reorganized company is projected to earn $57
            million before taxes and other items this year and $71 million a
            year by 2017, enough to support its new debt load of about $320
            million in secured debt, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The disclosure statement complies with the requirements
            of the bankruptcy code' and has enough information to allow
            creditors to vote on the plan, Grossman wrote in an order in
            U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MModal, acquired by New York-based JPMorgan's One Equity
            Partners in a $1.14 billion leveraged buyout in August 2012,
            filed for bankruptcy on March 20. The Franklin, Tennessee-based
            company listed assets of $626.8 million and liabilities totaling
            $876.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MModal struggled to make payments on the debt as software
            and other products supplanted its transcription business, which
            converts health-care providers' dictation to text and generated
            more than 80 percent of revenue. Sales fell more than 9 percent
            last year to $411 million as earnings dropped almost 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's $250 million in 10.75 percent senior
            unsecured notes due in 2020 last traded at 26 cents on the
            dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They sold for
            46.93 cents at the beginning of the year, on Jan. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Legend Parent Inc., 14-bk-10701, U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Samurai Boom With Biggest Sale Since October</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. lender, raised 105.6 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in the
            largest sale of Samurai bonds since October as overseas
            borrowers flock to a market flush with stimulus cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four-part offering includes 51.5 billion yen of 0.462
            percent three-year bonds priced to yield 10 basis points more
            than the yen swap rate, and 27 billion yen of 2018 notes at a
            spread of 14 basis points, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The New York-based lender also sold 10-year fixed-rate and three-year floating-rate debt, the
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan follows Rabobank Nederland and Nordea Bank AB in
            offering Samurai notes as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko
            Kuroda's plan to double the monetary base helps bolster demand
            for higher-yielding debt. HSBC Holdings Plc's banking unit,
            Credit Agricole SA and the Slovak Republic are planning
            offerings this month, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors are looking to shift their portfolios from
            government bonds, but they can't really go into the more
            volatile securities like stocks,' Mana Nakazora, Tokyo-based
            chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas SA, said in a telephone
            interview. 'The issuers are taking advantage of the strong
            investor appetite for foreign bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Says There Was No Lying, Hiding on Whale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co (JPM). will fight 'till the end' anyone who sues claiming they were misled over
            more than $6.2 billion in losses at the chief investment office last year, Chief Executive Officer Jamie
            Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There was no hiding, there was no lying, there was no bulls----ing,
            period,' Dimon said today at a conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            he conceded the company made some mistakes, 'no one at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), not one single solitary person,
            from CIO, to risk, to finance, to myself -- and a lot of people looked at it -- thought we had a big
            problem' when the bank reported earnings on April 13, 2012, the day Dimon dismissed news reports about the
            trade as a 'complete tempest in a teapot,' he said. Executives thought they had losses that might cost about
            $200 million, Dimon said, 'not a $6 billion problem.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trading book had already lost
            more than $1 billion by that time, according to documents turned over to the U.S. Senate Permanent
            Subcommittee on Investigations, which released a 301-page report in March that accused the largest and most
            profitable U.S. bank of hiding losses, deceiving regulators and misinforming investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon,
            57, said the New York-based company would vigorously defend against lawsuits tied to the losses. 'Anyone who
            sues, we're going to fight that one till the end, too, by the way,' he said. 'So keep that in mind.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Credit Outlook Cut by S&amp;amp;P as U.S. Support Wanes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s credit-rating
            outlook was revised to negative by Standard Poor's, which said
            the likelihood of 'extraordinary' government support for the
            largest U.S. banks is waning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The outlook on JPMorgan's long-term rating of A was lowered
            from stable, SP said today in a statement. That brings JPMorgan
            in line with the seven other 'systemically important' banks
            including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
            whose outlooks were held at negative. New York-based JPMorgan is
            the biggest U.S. bank, with $2.4 trillion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP may stop giving weight to the implied taxpayer support
            that has bolstered credit ratings at eight of the largest U.S.
            bank-holding companies. In the wake of the 2008 credit crunch,
            investors have assumed the federal government would bail out
            lenders in a renewed crisis because their failure would be
            catastrophic for the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is becoming increasingly clear that holding company
            creditors may not receive extraordinary government support,'
            SP analysts led by Matthew Albrecht wrote in the statement. He
            cited the framework regulators are developing that could be used
            to dismantle and liquidate distressed banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP analysts believe that the U.S. government would still
            stand by the operating subsidiaries of the largest banks,
            Albrecht said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Absorbing Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Regulators are intent on asking holding-company creditors
            to absorb losses ahead of operating-company creditors, and
            they're putting mechanisms in place that could make that more
            likely,' he said. 'We don't believe the U.S. government is
            becoming less supportive, simply less supportive to a certain
            class of creditors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If SP entirely removed U.S. support from the credit rating
            of the bank-holding companies, it could result in a one- to two-level cut in their grades, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares dropped 0.9 percent to $53.90 at 11:52
            a.m. in New York, compared with a 0.7 percent decline in the KBW
            Bank Index. Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank, didn't
            respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP said it will review progress that regulators make on
            their new 'orderly liquidation authority' as it determines
            whether to stop including government support in its bank
            ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lehman Bankruptcy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. and U.K. regulators have been working on plans to
            allow large international banks to fail without damaging the
            rest of the financial system. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc. in 2008 helped trigger a worldwide economic
            meltdown that threatened to destroy other global lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We may remove the ratings uplift we currently incorporate
            if we believe that regulators and lawmakers are increasingly
            likely to ask holding-company bondholders to bear losses in the
            event of a liquidation of a systemically important bank,' SP
            said. 'We currently believe those creditors will be supported
            to prevent the contagion of a crisis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both the Bank of England and the Federal Deposit Insurance
            Corp. foresee that a wide range of unsecured creditors could
            face losses during a bank's failure, according to a paper
            released in December. Unsecured senior bondholders and uninsured
            depositors are among those who could take a financial hit, the
            paper said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan CFO Says Investment Bank May Need Job Cuts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank, may have to cut jobs and reduce
            compensation if trading revenue fails to rebound as expected,
            Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With results holding at current levels, 'compensation will
            come down,' Lake said today at an investor conference in New
            York. 'Then in the longer term, the question is whether we will
            have too much capacity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan warned investors last month that second-quarter
            fixed-income and equities trading would probably drop about 20
            percent from a year earlier amid low volatility across asset
            classes. Lake, 45, affirmed the New York-based bank's forecast
            today and said the slowdown appeared to be cyclical, rather than
            a permanent shift. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over time, we should expect to see these cyclical
            headwinds abate and get replaced with tailwinds,' including
            stronger global economic growth and higher interest rates, Lake
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's size allows it to withstand market lulls without
            overreacting, she said, while acknowledging the possibility that
            job cuts could be needed over the longer term. Rivals including
            Morgan Stanley have reduced staff and Zurich-based Credit Suisse
            Group AG is weighing the sale of additional stakes in an
            electronic interest-rates trading unit. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Great Moderation 2.0 Seen Lasting by JPMorgan Until Fed Shifts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The calm that has descended on
            financial markets has longer to run if history is any guide. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Having coined the phrase Great Moderation 2.0 to describe
            the lull back in April, JPMorgan Chase Co.'s John Normand is
            comparing this moment to periods of tranquility over the past
            three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His findings suggest the quiescence is here to stay for a
            while, meaning investors may be lulled into taking ever-greater
            risks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's head of foreign-exchange and international-rates
            strategy in London characterizes low volatility in the currency
            market as when swings in the Group of 10 major currencies slip
            and stay below 7 percent on a trailing three-month basis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While that happened for 45 business days as of the end of
            last week, the average timeframe of similar episodes since the
            1980s is 150 days. They ranged in length from three months when
            the Federal Reserve paused its easing of monetary policy in 2002
            to almost two years during the so-called Goldilocks era of the
            late 1990s when the U.S. economy was neither too hot nor too
            cold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The current undershoot is quiet immature by the
            historical norm,' Normand wrote in a June 6 research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More often than not, the Fed is the key. The last market
            lull ran for 156 business days and ended in May 2013 with the
            'taper tantrum' when Fed officials began suggesting they would
            soon start slowing monthly asset purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As most would acknowledge, central bank predictability is
            bearish for volatility,' he said. 'The current backdrop is
            textbook.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This time, the calm may continue unless U.S. inflation data
            or wage pressures force the Fed into tightening policy sooner
            than markets anticipate or if a geopolitical crisis blows up,
            said Normand. A Bloomberg News survey of economists in May
            suggested the consensus doesn't expect the Fed to raise its
            benchmark before the third quarter of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until these risks emerge 'this vol undershoot has further
            to run,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. named Manuel Esteve head of equity syndicate for Europe, the Middle East and
            Africa, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esteve succeeds Greg Chamberlain, who will become head of

            which was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the New York-based
            bank. Jonathan Wilcox, who has run U.K. equity capital markets,
            will move to U.K. investment banking to focus on corporate
            clients as a coverage banker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esteve previously ran the Iberia and Greece ECM team.
            Francesco Cardinali will add Iberia and Greece to his current
            responsibilities as head of Italy and Turkey equity capital
            markets, the memo shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranked No. 6 in managing share sales in Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa this year, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. The U.S. bank was the sole manager of Volkswagen

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Risk
            Officer John Hogan is returning to the bank in a new role after
            taking almost five months off and may decide to leave the firm
            altogether later this year or next, Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon told employees in a memo today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hogan will return to Dimon's operating committee and assume
            a newly created job as chairman of risk while interim CRO Ashley Bacon takes over in a permanent capacity
            starting next week,
            Dimon said in the memo. Bacon will also join the operating
            committee, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'John plans to carry out this important transition for
            several months,' Dimon said. 'We then hope he will stay at the
            firm in another senior role, but he may choose to do something
            different outside of our company.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A copy of the memo was obtained by Bloomberg News, and its
            contents were confirmed by Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the
            New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon said Hogan 'did a superb job as head of risk when we
            needed him most' and that he respects Hogan's decision to
            return to the bank in a different role. Hogan took leave in
            January for personal reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're very glad to have John back -- his judgment and
            candor make all of us better,' Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Private-Equity Unit to Become Independent</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, plans to break off its private-equity unit as an
            independent firm as the business raises a new fund backed by
            outside investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners will still make direct investments on
            behalf of JPMorgan for an 'interim period' and continue to
            manage the bank's existing group of portfolio companies, the New
            York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business eventually will be split off as those
            investments mature, according to a person with direct knowledge
            of the plan. One Equity manages about $4.5 billion for the bank,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The One Equity team has produced strong returns over the
            years,' Matt Zames, JPMorgan's chief operating officer, said in
            the statement. 'The time is right for them to seek new capital
            to strengthen their global strategy, as they continue to manage
            our existing portfolio to maximize value to the firm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are expanding businesses overseeing client money as
            they seek more stable forms of revenue, such as management fees.
            JPMorgan's private-equity results have been uneven in recent
            quarters, swinging from a $50 million profit in the fourth
            quarter to a $182 million loss in the first three months of this
            year, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Volatile Earnings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earnings within the unit will likely be volatile and
            'influenced by capital-markets activity, market levels, the
            performance of the broader economy and investment-specific
            issues,' the company said in a May 8 filing with the Securities
            and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One Equity typically invests from $50 million to $250
            million per transaction, the firm said, concentrating in North
            America, Europe, Asia and South America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federally backed banks face restrictions in how much they
            can invest in private-equity and hedge funds under the so-called
            Volcker rule, a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The rule
            limits investments to no more than 3 percent of the fund or 3
            percent of the lender's Tier 1 capital. JPMorgan had about $7.7
            billion in total private-equity holdings and $163.8 billion in
            Tier 1 capital as of March 31, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;

            and Conor Hillery co-heads of its U.K. investment banking
            business, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;De, currently co-head of equity capital markets for Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa, and Hillery, head of the U.K.
            financial institutions group, will report to Chairman Tim Wise,
            the memo shows. Its contents were confirmed by a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            have been increasing their share of European investment-banking
            fees, the New York-based research firm Freeman Co. reported

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Buy Property in Downtown San Francisco</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset-management unit bought a San Francisco property from Jamestown
            LP in a $415 million deal that includes offices, a hotel and a
            development site, said two people with knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase of 22 Fourth St. near Union Square closed
            today, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
            transaction is private. JPMorgan will acquire 430,000 square
            feet (40,000 square meters) in two buildings known as Pacific
            Place, as well as a land parcel, the people said. Tenants
            include the 198-room Hotel Palomar, software maker Intuit Inc.
            and retailers Old Navy, Levi's and the Container Store. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, declined to comment. Jamestown, a closely held real
            estate investment firm based in Atlanta, confirmed the sale
            without naming the buyer or price in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;San Francisco's office market is luring property investors
            after a surge in leasing demand led by technology companies
            pushed rents up 70 percent since 2010, according to Jones Lang
            LaSalle Inc. The metropolitan area has California's lowest
            unemployment rate at 4.3 percent and an economy that has added
            jobs each month for almost five years, state labor data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very strong market, with tons of tenant activity
            driving investment activity,' Grant Lammersen, a sales broker
            at Cushman Wakefield Inc. with a waterfront office listing at
            188 Embarcadero, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Salesforce Tower &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com Inc. in April agreed to lease 714,000 square
            feet in a skyscraper being built by Boston Properties Inc. that
            will be the city's tallest and named for San Francisco-based
            Salesforce, the biggest maker of customer-management software. A
            unit of Shenzhen, China-based developer Genzon Property Group
            Co. last month bought a majority stake in 225 Bush St. offices
            in the financial district, in a deal valued at $350 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pacific Place, two blocks from Union Square's cluster of
            upscale shops and theaters, has 202,000 square feet of offices
            fully leased to Mountain View, California-based Intuit's
            Demandforce unit and 200 feet (61 meters) of retail frontage on
            Market Street, Jamestown said. The area is the main transit
            corridor for city buses and Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, the
            regional subway and rail system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The addition of a signature tenant like Intuit and its
            long-term lease created an attractive investment for a buyer,'
            Jamestown Chief Operating Officer Michael Phillips said in the
            statement. 'We remain committed to the San Francisco Bay Area
            as we are very engaged in the community through our other local
            properties.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan buys properties on behalf of institutional
            investors through its Global Real Assets business. The unit, run
            by Joe Azelby, invests and manages in real estate,
            infrastructure and maritime assets around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC was the listing broker for Jamestown. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Boston Race Emotional Return for Bombing Victims</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The last time Roseann Sdoia attended
            a road race, terror shattered the course and left her with a leg
            amputated above the knee. Tonight, she'll be back to sound the
            starting horn as racing returns to downtown Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have mixed emotions because I should be there running,
            but I'm not,' said Sdoia, 45, who has undergone three surgeries
            since the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three and
            injured more than 260 people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tonight's 3.5-mile J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge race,
            which starts at 7:20 p.m., is one of the first organized
            competitions in downtown Boston since the terrorist attack. It
            begins at the Boston Common and runs parallel to the last mile
            or so of the marathon course. For many participants, the event
            is an emotional return to a neighborhood devastated by the twin
            bomb blasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The race itself symbolizes a lot of the running community
            and the Boston community coming together and really slowly
            taking back the city and taking back running,' said Cara
            Bednar, 28, who finished the marathon in under four hours, about
            10 to 15 minutes before the first blast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 12,000 people from 569 companies are registered for
            tonight's race, said Erich Timmerman, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which is
            organizing the event.
            JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is donating all registration
            fees, about $500,000, to One Fund Boston, which was created to
            assist victims of the bombings and their families, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan Sale of $304 Million Mortgage Bonds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is planning a
            sale of U.S. home-loan bonds without government backing, adding
            to evidence that the market for the securities is beginning to
            pick up steam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal will be tied to $303.7 million of prime 15-year
            mortgages, according to a person with knowledge of the
            transaction who asked not to be identified without authorization
            to speak publicly. While most of the loans had original balances
            larger than the current threshold for jumbo mortgages, the
            market's focus since its revival, 14.5 percent of the debt is
            smaller than $400,000, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premium Point Investments LP's WinWater Home Mortgage LLC
            yesterday completed its first non-agency bond transaction, a
            deal tied to about $250 million of jumbo loans, and Citigroup
            Inc. (C) is planning a similar $219 million offering. After reviving
            from the paralysis caused by the 2008 financial crisis the debt
            helped spark, issuance of non-agency securities had slowed after
            the middle of last year as banks seek jumbo loans to hold as
            investments and bond buyers pay less for the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're seeing repeat and new issuers attempt to bring the
            market back,'Michele Patterson, a senior director at Kroll
            Bond Rating Agency, said in a telephone interview. 'We are not
            at last year's levels, and we don't anticipate getting to last
            year's levels. I think the second half will probably be about
            the same as the first half' of the year in terms of sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;September Collapse &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While total issuance of non-agency securities tied to new
            loans jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in
            2012, sales collapsed after September, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance totals about $1.8 billion this
            year. Sales peaked at $1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
            government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
            $625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
            costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average age of the loans in the JPMorgan transaction is
            about one year, with 5.2 percent of the mortgages older than 30
            months, the person said. First Republic Bank originated 55
            percent of the mortgages, while JPMorgan's bank made 38 percent,
            the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Loss Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount of loss protection for investors known as credit
            enhancement, totaling 5.5 percent for part of the AAA portion of
            the transaction, is the lowest yet seen by Kroll, which was
            founded after the crisis and has been hired to grade the deal,
            Patterson said. The inclusion of only mortgages with terms of 15
            years or less, a first since the credit seizure, improves the
            quality of the transaction because the loans typically perform
            better than 30-year debt, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some other AAA portions of the deal have 10 percent
            enhancement, the person said. Most of WinWater's top-rated bonds
            carried 15 percent of credit enhancement, with a smaller amount
            offering a buffer of 8.25 percent. The safety margin is provided
            by features such as some bonds losing principal amid losses on
            the underlying loans before others. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys Larger Developers as Bubble Deflates: China Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management and
            Invesco Asset Management say China's cooling property market is
            an opportunity to boost dollar bond holdings as the government's
            targeted stimulus benefits the largest developers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese real-estate companies accounted for six of the 10
            best-performing Asian notes in the past three months, according
            to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The yield on 2018 debt
            of China Overseas Land Investments Ltd., the nation's largest
            developer by market value, dropped to 3.35 percent last week,
            from a record 4.31 percent on Feb. 5, while that on similar-maturity bonds of China Vanke Co. fell to 3.95
            percent, from an
            all-time high of 5.07 percent on March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will pick the winners from these trends,' said
            Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income at JPMorgan Asset,
            which oversees $39 billion in emerging-market debt. 'Although
            sales and prices are falling along with margins, we have
            identified the larger developers are gaining market share and
            executing well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to safeguard this year's
            growth target of 7.5 percent, fueling bets the government will
            encourage increased lending to selected projects and relax
            restrictions in the real-estate market. Larger developers may
            benefit from industry consolidation as smaller builders face a
            funding squeeze with a record amount of property trusts maturing
            next year and prices falling in the most cities in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Softening Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Home prices declined in 35 of China's 70 cities last month
            from April, the most since May 2012, official data showed June
            18. In the financial center of Shanghai, prices decreased 0.3
            percent, the first drop in two years, while they fell 0.2
            percent in the southern business hub of Shenzhen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Softening prices are good because they imply there isn't
            a bubble anymore,' said Ken Hu, Hong Kong-based chief
            investment officer of fixed income for Asia Pacific at Invesco,
            which manages $787 billion globally. 'We pick developers with
            high turnover and those who tend to build smaller-sized flats.
            Profit margin isn't that key to bondholders like us. Our
            approach is to buy on dips.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developers including Vanke that cut prices by 10 percent to
            15 percent achieved good sales volume, Deutsche Bank AG analysts
            led by Hong Kong-based Tony Tsang wrote in a June 13 report.
            Vanke, headquartered in Shenzhen, recorded a 16.2 percent
            increase in sales value in the first five months of 2014 from a
            year earlier, it said in a June 3 statement to the Shenzhen
            stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Taking Advantage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Larger industry players are able to tap overseas capital
            markets for funds. Sales of dollar bonds by Chinese companies
            totaled $91 billion in 2014, compared with $89 billion in the
            previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smaller builders, which rely on property trusts for
            financing, have to repay 203.5 billion yuan ($32.7 billion) in
            2015, according to research firm Use Trust. That's almost double
            the 109 billion yuan due this year. China's banking regulator
            said on June 6 it will monitor developer finances, a sign of
            concern defaults may spread after the March collapse of Zhejiang
            Xingrun Real Estate Co., a builder south of Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It won't be surprising to have a few defaults in the
            sector in an economic slowdown, given you have thousands of
            developers and many of them are small ones,' BOCI's Wang said.
            'The bigger ones, especially those listed, can take advantage
            to lower their funding costs as the industry consolidates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China South City Holdings Ltd. (1668), which runs logistics parks
            for industrial materials, sold 1 billion yuan of five-year bonds
            at a coupon of 7.5 percent in the interbank market on May 9. It
            plans to use the proceeds to repay short-term bank loans.
            Greenland Holding Group has hired banks to arrange investor
            meetings from today for a potential dollar bond offering,
            according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Borrowing Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vanke's bond borrowing costs dropped to 3.45 percent on a
            weighted average last week, compared with 5.5 percent in the
            first quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            It also managed to extend the average maturity of its notes to
            3.95 years, from 2.43 years in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slowing growth is causing declines in the yuan and onshore
            interest rates. The Chinese currency has fallen 2.8 percent
            against the dollar this year, the worst performance in Asia. The
            yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has dropped 52
            basis points to 4.04 percent in the same period as investors
            sought safe havens. Gross domestic product will probably expand
            7.3 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, according to
            a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Prolonged Downturn &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The downturn in the property market will be more prolonged
            this time than in previous corrections, Tom Byrne, senior vice
            president at Moody's, said at a June 19 conference in Shanghai.
            Broad price cuts are likely to come in late August or in
            September when more new projects are set to be introduced, UBS
            AG Hong Kong-based analyst Eva Lee wrote in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moody's revised its credit outlook for Chinese developers
            to negative from stable on May 21. The Shanghai Stock Exchange
            Property Index, which tracks 24 real-estate companies listed in
            the city, has slumped 6.3 percent this year, exceeding the 4.2
            percent decline for the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Overall, the housing market is cooling in some parts,
            like in third- or fourth-tier cities,' said Chang at JPMorgan
            Asset. 'But we do see a silver lining. There's actually a
            healthy pickup in transactions at specific locations after some
            discounting.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Minor Stimulus' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation has introduced measures to help the real-estate
            industry, which JPMorgan Chase Co. says poses the biggest
            near-term risk to growth in the world's second-largest economy.
            The People's Bank of China told 15 banks in May to improve
            efficiency of service, give timely approval and distribution of
            mortgages to qualified buyers. The southeastern city of Fuzhou
            has removed home-purchase limits for buyers who make one-time
            payments, the Securities Times reported on June 18, citing sales
            people from two developers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government may announce additional 'minor stimulus
            measures' after Premier Li said in London last week that the
            nation will maintain a minimum growth rate of 7.5 percent,
            according to a China Securities Journal commentary on June 20.
            The PBOC may release more targeted steps to prevent expansion
            from falling short of the goal, it added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Policy makers are actually putting out more measures to
            support this sector,' said Arthur Lau, Hong Kong-based head of
            Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which
            oversees about $71 billion. 'I think, volume-wise, it could
            catch up a little bit in the second half, especially those who
            are not aggressively buying land. There is still a wide
            selection, even within this sector.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UBS Fares Better Than Credit Suisse on Legal Risks: JPM</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) is a better bet than its
            Zurich neighbor Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) even though it's more
            exposed to legal risks, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS could nearly quadruple its litigation reserve to 7
            billion Swiss francs ($7.8 billion) by 2016 and still have a
            common equity ratio of 13 percent, Kian Abouhossein and Amit Ranjan, banking analysts at JPMorgan in London,
            said in a note
            today. They included a dividend yield of 10.3 percent in this
            estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS had 1.8 billion francs in reserve for legal matters at
            the end of the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By contrast, Credit Suisse reported a common equity ratio
            of 10 percent at the end of March. Factoring in a $2.6 billion
            fine to settle a U.S. tax-evasion case in May, that figure drops
            to 9.3 percent, the lowest of the 17 global investment banks
            tracked by Bloomberg Industries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'On litigation, in our view CSG appears better placed than
            UBS,' Abouhossein and Ranjan said in their note. 'However, UBS
            has sufficient cushion in our estimates to take litigation
            charges.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse will generate 48 percent of investment
            banking-related revenues from equities in 2015, according to
            Abouhossein and Ranjan, compared with 68 percent at UBS. As a
            result, the analysts said they 'see UBS business mix as much
            more attractive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That makes Switzerland's second-largest bank more dependent
            on fixed income, an area of investment banking that the analysts
            said is shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank, also has more estimated
            future revenue from 'asset-gathering-geared activities'
            relative to total income. Credit Suisse will have 55 percent of
            revenue from these businesses in 2015, the analysts estimate,
            compared with 68 percent for UBS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'UBS again is more attractive than CSG,' Abouhossein and
            Ranjan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS also has an advantage in wealth management because of
            its stronger position in Asia, which they view as the fastest-growing region, and in the U.S., the men said.

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Sell $304 Million Mortgage-Bond Issue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold bonds tied
            to about $304 million of U.S. home loans without government
            backing, adding to signs of life in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction included $171 million of top-rated
            securities paying a 3 percent coupon, which were sold at 102.2
            cents on the dollar, according to a person with knowledge of the
            offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
            authorization to speak publicly. That's about 1.5 cents on the
            dollar less than comparable benchmark Fannie Mae-guaranteed
            bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes are unlike other recent deals because they're
            backed almost entirely by 15-year mortgages, which are often
            taken by 'more financially secure' borrowers relative to more
            common 30-year loans, according to a presale report by Standard
            Poor's. The average size of the mortgages, at about $558,000,
            was also smaller than the $850,000 in previous JPMorgan deals
            since the 2008 financial crisis, SP said. They were mainly
            'jumbo' loans, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction's contracts included an 'untested and
            rigid' process for forcing JPMorgan or other originators of the
            underlying loans to buy back misrepresented debt, SP said.
            Seeing that 'the framework is more restrictive than those in
            other recent prime transactions, we imposed additional loss
            coverage requirements in our review.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While issuance of non-agency securities tied to new loans
            jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in 2012,
            sales collapsed after September, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
            totals about $2.1 billion this year, and Citigroup Inc. (C) has been
            also planning a sale this month. Offerings peaked at $1.2
            trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
            government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
            $625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
            costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>KKR Said to Hire JPMorgan, HSBC for Tarkett IPO in France</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co. (KKR) has named four banks
            including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) to manage
            an initial public offering of French floor maker Tarkett SA,
            according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America Corp. have also been
            selected, the people said, asking not to be identified as the
            process isn't public. The IPO could raise about 500 million
            euros ($651 million) and is planned for the second half of the
            year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR, the private-equity firm run by Henry Kravis and George
            Roberts, sought to sell its 50 percent stake in Tarkett this
            year in a deal that would have valued the firm at as much as
            $3.8 billion, people familiar said March 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tarkett, which manufactures and sells PVC, wood, laminate,
            sports and other specialty flooring products, increased sales 11
            percent to 2.3 billion euros in 2012, helped by acquisitions and
            demand in Eastern Europe, Asia and North America. The company,
            based in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, has been jointly owned by
            KKR and the Deconinck family since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for KKR, Bank of America, JPMorgan, HSBC and
            Deutsche Bank declined to comment on any process. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Probe of JPMorgan's Madoff Ties Seen Snagged on Agency Rift</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is
            stalling a regulatory investigation of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s
            business dealings with convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff,
            an inspector general told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eric Thorson, the Treasury Department's internal watchdog,
            wrote to lawmakers on June 20 to complain that the Justice
            Department's civil division hasn't acted to move the case
            forward despite his request for assistance 'many weeks' ago,
            making it impossible to resolve 'an important issue involving
            one of the country's largest financial institutions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department doesn't comment publicly on internal
            deliberations. An official who spoke on condition of anonymity
            said the agency is continuing to review the complex legal issues
            involved and hasn't shelved the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The flap arises from an inquiry by the Office of the
            Comptroller of the Currency, a part of the Treasury, which has
            been reviewing JPMorgan's ties to Madoff. The former investment
            adviser maintained accounts with the bank for two decades before
            confessing to running a fraud that caused investors to lose
            about $17 billion in principal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thorson stepped into the fray when he was asked late last
            year by the OCC to make sure that JPMorgan wasn't impeding their
            investigation by withholding some documents under attorney-client privilege. The inspector general worked
            out an agreement
            with the bank that would allow a federal judge to review the
            documents and decide whether the privilege was properly invoked. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Expanding Argentine Business After Barclays Leaves</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is expanding
            its business in Argentina as the country remains a ''key'' market
            in the region, the bank's senior country officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is leasing an additional
            three floors in its headquarters in Buenos Aires and hiring
            about 15 people this year, Facundo Gomez Minujin said. The New
            York-based bank has operated its local investment unit in
            Argentina since 1985, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;''Argentina remains a key element of our JPMorgan franchise
            in Latin America,' Gomez Minujin wrote in an e-mail. 'In the
            last 12 months we have increased our headcount.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is expanding in South America's second-largest
            economy even as competitors have cut staff and closed divisions
            amid a tightening of currency controls and financial oversight
            by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government.
            Barclays Plc (BARC) closed its wealth management office in Buenos Aires
            in January 2012 'for strategic reasons' while Exotix, a
            brokerage, last year transferred some staff to New York and
            London due to regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gomez Minujin denied a report published today from Buenos
            Aires-based newspaper Clarin that the bank was leaving the
            country by the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're maintaining our presence Argentina just like we
            always have,' he said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seeks Bigger Payout With Smaller Buyback, CFO Lake Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, asked regulators to approve a higher quarterly
            dividend and reduced stock buyback after suffering its biggest
            trading loss ever last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We know that we would like to increase our dividend,'
            Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors during a
            Boston investor conference sponsored by Citigroup Inc. 'We did
            ask for buybacks, but lower than last year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve forced JPMorgan to suspend a $15
            billion share repurchase program last year after the lender
            disclosed derivatives losses that eventually swelled to more
            than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan's board of directors cut Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon's pay for 2012 in half after a
            review of the so-called London Whale episode held him partly
            responsible for the botched trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon previously told analysts that JPMorgan reduced its
            2013 buyback target by at least 20 percent to less than $3
            billion per quarter. The bank is projected to raise its 30-cent
            quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share, according to analysts
            surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The entire capital plan needs Fed approval as part of the
            central bank's annual review of the biggest U.S. lenders, with
            an answer expected by mid-March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're going to find out over the course of the next week
            or so whether or not we get our capital plan approved,' Lake
            said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stress Test &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan executives want to return more capital to
            shareholders, next year's payouts will depend on new
            international capital rules and how they affect the Fed's so-
            called stress test, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We'll make our decision when we know how things shake out
            toward the end of this year,' Lake said. 'And we'd like to
            return capital back to shareholders. So we hope to have a chance
            to do that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased $1.6 billion shares before its buyback
            program was shut down last year. The Fed later approved the
            repurchase of $3 billion in additional shares in this year's
            first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of the original amount
            still unused. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon has said he's inclined to buy back shares when the
            price falls below tangible book value, a theoretical measure of
            what the company would be worth in a liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Extends Deadline for Acceptance of Mortgage-Bond Accord</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to give
            mortgage-bond trustees evaluating a proposed $4.5 billion
            settlement over bad loans an extra three months to consider
            signing onto the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deadline was extended to June 16, according to a letter
            posted to a website for the settlement. Trustees including Bank
            of New York Mellon Corp., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo Co. (WFC)
            had asked the New York-based bank for the change in a letter
            dated March 4. Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan's general counsel,
            agreed to the request, the document shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The previous deadline was March 16, according to an earlier
            letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's tentative deal to offer payments to bond
            investors for mortgages that failed to match their promised
            quality is part of an effort by the largest U.S. bank to move
            past legal troubles tied in part to the housing crisis. The
            accord was announced in November during the week before the
            company agreed to a record $13 billion settlement with
            government agencies over faulty mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed that
            the deadline was pushed back and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $4.5 billion proposed accord was negotiated between
            JPMorgan and 21 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK)
            and Pacific Investment Management Co. Trustees representing all
            investors in individual transactions must accept the deal. Hedge
            fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to continue
            separate lawsuits over some of the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs Bruns LLP representing
            the investors who negotiated the deal, declined to comment, as
            did Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York, and Ari Cohen
            of Deutsche Bank and Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, UBS Convictions Overturned in Milan Swaps Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Deutsche Bank
            AG, UBS AG (UBSN) and Depfa Bank Plc won a bid to overturn a conviction
            for overseeing fraud by their bankers in the sale of derivatives
            to the city of Milan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An appeals court in Milan cleared the banks and individuals
            at the firms because 'the alleged crimes didn't take place,'
            Judge Luigi Martino said as he read out the verdict today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the appeals trial, prosecutor Piero de Petris had argued
            that the banks, in their roles as advisers to the municipality,
            should have disclosed how much the derivatives were costing the
            borrower. Defense lawyers cited testimony by municipal officials
            during the lower-court trial as proof the city was aware the
            four banks were making money on the trades and of the magnitude
            of those commissions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Deutsche Bank (DBK) welcomes today's verdict in the Appeals
            Court of Milan, which has confirmed that Deutsche Bank and its
            employees acted properly and in compliance with all laws and
            regulation,' the German bank said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Recoup Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Municipalities from Detroit to Naples have lost money on
            derivatives that were meant to lower borrowing costs and instead
            backfired. Italian local governments, including the city of
            Florence and the region of Piedmont, have sought to recoup their
            losses through legal action at home and in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan CFO Says $27 Billion Profit Outlook Isn't Target</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake said the $27 billion profit outlook the
            bank laid out at an investor conference last month wasn't a
            target and the firm can earn more than that. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's not a forecast, that's not a budget, it's a
            simulation, and it was really predicated only on those things
            that we're really certain of,' Lake said today in a Bloomberg
            Television interview with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker.
            'I think there's every reason to believe that it's biased to
            the conservative.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $27 billion outlook compares with net income of $17.9
            billion last year and $21.3 billion in 2012. At the firm's
            investor day in 2013, JPMorgan presented a scenario in which
            earnings could increase to $27.5 billion, while saying its
            target was $24 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's outlook only factored in the impact of higher
            interest rates and investments the firm has made in its business
            over the past few years, Lake said. It didn't include higher
            trading revenue, even as the bank 'absolutely expects' that
            business to grow over the next five years, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lake also said that rising costs from regulation will be
            'somewhat permanent.' Still, JPMorgan holds the 'best hand'
            among large banks and will continue to outperform rivals,
            according to Lake. She declined to forecast the maximum the bank
            could earn in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan U.S. Chief Equity Strategist Thomas Lee to Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Thomas Lee, the JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who has called for gains in American
            stocks (SPX) for six straight years and got them in four, is leaving
            the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, 44, is stepping down tomorrow after holding the job
            since 2007, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based
            firm, said in a telephone interview. Lee wants to take time away
            from work, according to a memo sent to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, who worked for JPMorgan for 15 years, is among almost
            two dozen Wall Street strategists who try to predict the
            direction of the stock market and advise investors on which
            companies to buy and sell. He had one of the highest year-end
            forecasts for the Standard Poor's 500 Index, telling investors
            last week to stay bullish and buy health-care, technology and
            financial stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He's just one of the best strategists in the game,'
            Philip Orlando, who helps oversee nearly $400 billion as chief
            equity-market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said in a
            phone interview. 'I'm surprised and disappointed that a young
            guy at the top of his game would be resigning.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, a managing director at the largest U.S. bank, didn't
            respond to a telephone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Always Bullish &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
            chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual rise of
            14 percent in the SP 500 over the period. He was more accurate
            than the average of strategist forecasts in four of the six
            years, including 2012 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like every one of his competitors tracked by Bloomberg, Lee
            failed to foresee the stock-market decline in 2008. He called
            for an 8.3 percent increase in the SP 500 that year. The
            benchmark gauge plummeted 38 percent in its worst annual
            performance since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before taking the strategist job, he covered the wireless
            and telecommunications industry from 1999 to 2007 and added
            small-cap stocks in 2004, being recognized by Institutional
            Investor magazine every year since 1998, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He held positions at Oppenheimer Co., Kidder Peabody
            Co. and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. He received a bachelor's
            degree in economics in 1991 from the Wharton School at the
            University of Pennsylvania with dual concentrations in finance
            and accounting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Good Reputation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He has a good reputation,' Hugh Johnson, who oversees $2
            billion as chairman of Albany, New York-based Hugh Johnson
            Advisors LLC. Strategists 'are helpful in thinking about
            issues,' he said. 'They can tell you what the issues are and
            give you interesting ways to analyze the issues.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 will probably end the year at 2,075, Lee said
            in a March 7 report. Only Weeden Co. and Canaccord Genuity
            Securities LLC have higher estimates, according to a survey
            compiled by Bloomberg of 21 strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, Lee stuck to his bullish
            stance even as the SP 500 slid as much as 5.8 percent in
            February. He was ultimately proved correct as the equities
            benchmark recovered the losses by the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His predictions during the rebound were more accurate. His
            target of 1,100 for the U.S. equity benchmark in 2009 was only
            off by 15 points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'His viewpoints have been very much on the money and he
            will do well wherever he goes,' John Manley, who helps oversee
            about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo
            Funds Management in New York, said in a phone interview.
            'Hopefully, he reappears somewhere else.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to HSBC Face EU Rate-Rigging Fines From Almunia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) face a European Union complaint as soon as
            next month as the bloc's antitrust chief races to fine a quartet of financial companies that snubbed
            rate-rigging settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, whose term ends on Oct. 31, is determined to
            punish the two banks as well as Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and interdealer broker ICAP Plc (IAP) before he
            leaves office, said three people familiar with the probe who asked not to be named because the process is
            private. To meet the target, he plans to send so-called statements of objections in the Euribor and Libor
            cases close to Easter, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He will want to end on a high note,'
            Pierre-Henri Conac, a professor specializing in banking at the University of Luxembourg, said in an
            interview. 'He'll be happy to say: 'I did it.'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almunia, 65, sees the fines as
            unfinished business after the four holdouts ruined his attempt to get a clean sweep of settlements in
            rate-rigging cases, part of a global scandal that tarnished the reputation of some of the world's biggest
            lenders. The next seven months are the last chance for the former Spanish economist to burnish his legacy
            after he pledged to quit political life when he leaves the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Set to Cash in on Deals From SFR to ONO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) are set for a fee bonanza with both banks playing roles on
            the sale of Vivendi SA (VIV)'s French wireless unit, and Vodafone
            Group Plc (VOD)'s purchase of a Spanish cable company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based banks are advisers on Altice SA (ATC)'s effort
            to acquire Vivendi's SFR unit in a $28 billion deal, and also
            Vodafone's agreement to buy Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for $10
            billion. If completed, the SFR purchase will be the second-largest globally this year, and the two
            transactions could
            generate as much as $173 million in advisory fees for Morgan
            Stanley, JP Morgan and other banks, according to estimates from
            New York-based research firm Freeman Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan are currently the top advisers
            so far this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Dealmakers
            are having their strongest start to the year since before the
            global financial crisis amid growing economic confidence and
            rising share prices. Deals in technology, media and
            telecommunications continue to drive overall activity, with five
            of the top 10 being in that space, including the proposed SFR
            purchase, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vivendi is in exclusive talks with Altice to sell for an
            enterprise value of 20 billion euros, or $28 billion, according
            to its billionaire owner Patrick Drahi. A deal could be
            completed by the end of the month, Drahi said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If that deal closes, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley could
            split as much as $52 million as advisers to Altice, while
            Vivendi's banks Citigroup Inc. and Lazard Ltd. could share as
            much as $59 million, according to Freeman estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan will share in up to $35 million of fees
            with three other banks that advised Ono on its 7.2 billion euro
            sale to Vodafone. Deutsche Bank AG was the lead adviser to Ono's
            shareholders, and Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG were co-advisers along with JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For its part as an adviser to Vodafone, Morgan Stanley will
            split as much as $27 million with Robertson Robey Associates
            LLP, which separately advised the buyer's board, Freeman's
            estimates show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Agrees to Sell Commodities Unit for $3.5 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will sell its
            physical commodities unit to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. for $3.5
            billion, ending a five-year foray into owning and storing raw
            materials amid pressure from regulators to leave the business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, disclosed in a statement from New York-based
            JPMorgan today, takes the bank out of industries such as
            petroleum products and power while cementing Mercuria's standing
            among the world's biggest commodity traders. JPMorgan will
            continue to provide services and products tied to commodities
            including financing, market-making and the vaulting and trading
            of precious metals, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was
            interested in preserving the value of JPMorgan's physical
            business,' Blythe Masters, head of the company's global
            commodities operations, said in the statement. 'Mercuria is a
            global leader in the commodities markets and an excellent long-term home.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling amid concern among regulators that
            banks could control prices if they own commodities as well as
            trade them, or suffer catastrophic losses that would endanger
            the financial system. The Federal Reserve said in July it might
            force insured lenders to get out, and JPMorgan agreed later that
            month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated
            power markets, without admitting wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

            and North Africa as it expands in the oil-rich region. &lt;/p&gt;

            obtained today by Bloomberg News. The contents of the document
            were confirmed by a bank spokeswoman. Raza was previously head
            of treasury and investor services in the region for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is boosting its presence in the
            Middle East, hiring executives from banks including Nomura
            International Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc. It promoted Rayan Fayez
            as senior country officer for Saudi Arabia in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender appointed Ali Moosa as head of treasury

            also report to Leenart, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sued by Investor Over 'Culture of Lawlessness'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and directors
            including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon were sued by an
            investor for creating 'a culture of lawlessness' that led to
            billions of dollars in settlements tied to mortgage-backed
            securities and Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under Dimon's leadership, the New York-based company sold
            low-quality residential mortgage-backed securities, failed to
            report questionable activity by Madoff, manipulated energy
            markets and engaged in fraudulent credit-card billing
            strategies, the Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund said in
            papers filed March 17 in Delaware Chancery Court and partly
            unsealed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, CEO since December 2005 and chairman since December
            2006, 'knowingly, recklessly, or with gross negligence created
            a culture of lawlessness' that resulted in fines, penalties
            settlements and related costs totaling at least $20 billion last
            year, the fund said. At the same time, Dimon received a
            74 percent pay raise to $20 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, agreed in
            November to a $13 billion settlement of government allegations
            that it misled investors and public when it sold bonds backed by
            faulty residential mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed
            JPMorgan's actions for helping to cause the credit crisis that
            led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's China Investment Banking CEO Fang Fang to Leave Firm</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fang Fang, JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co.'s
            chief executive officer of investment banking for China, is
            leaving after more than 12 years at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 48-year-old banker told New York-based JPMorgan that he
            wanted to retire, according to an internal memo obtained by
            Bloomberg News today. Frank Gong was named chairman of China
            investment banking in the message from Therese Esperdy, co-head
            of Asia-Pacific banking at the firm. Marie Cheung, a spokeswoman
            in Hong Kong, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fang's impending departure comes amid an investigation into
            JPMorgan's Asian hiring practices. U.S. authorities are
            examining whether the firm employed people in Asia so that their
            relatives in government would steer business to the bank, people
            with knowledge of the probes have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fang joined JPMorgan in August 2001 and was a former vice
            president of Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd., an investment
            company controlled by the government of China's capital. He
            became head of JPMorgan's China investment-banking business in
            2007 and was made vice chairman for Asia investment banking in
            2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banker submitted his resignation last week as he wants
            to spend more time with his family, a person with knowledge of
            the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Mike Cavanagh, who served as a close deputy to Chief Executive Officer Jamie
            Dimon for more than two decades, will leave to become co-chief operating officer of Carlyle Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, 48, was seen internally as a potential successor to Dimon, 58, who has told people he
            wants to remain CEO for another five years, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, asking not to
            be identified discussing personnel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Top bankers and traders have left the biggest Wall
            Street firms for more lucrative jobs in private equity and at hedge funds, as regulation of lenders has
            intensified following the financial crisis and lower returns have pushed banks to cut the amount of revenue
            they set aside for compensation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The regulatory landscape definitely makes it less
            enticing for some of these great managers to stay at the big banks, and the talent drain will continue,'
            said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at New York-based International Strategy Investment Group LLC. 'It's a
            significant loss for JPMorgan and a huge win for Carlyle, no two ways about it.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uncertainty
            about when the CEO job would become available also may have contributed to Cavanagh's decision, Matt
            Burnell, a Wells Fargo Co. analyst, wrote in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Peregrine Bankruptcy Trustee Ends Dispute With JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Peregrine Financial Group Inc.'s
            trustee agreed to settle a dispute with JPMorgan Chase Co. in
            a deal that will bring more than $15 million to creditors of the
            commodities firm, which filed for bankruptcy after its founder
            looted client accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the agreement filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
            Court in Chicago, JPMorgan will pay $1.25 million and release
            $14 million in cash it's holding as collateral for its claim
            against Peregrine. JPMorgan also agreed to reduce the size of
            that claim, the trustee, Ira Bodenstein, said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal 'secures a favorable compromise that
            substantially reduces the estate's costs and downside risk with
            respect to the JPMorgan claims,' according to Bodenstein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peregrine, a Cedar Falls, Iowa-based commodities firm with
            offices in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy to liquidate in 2012
            after the National Futures Association said more than $200
            million in customer funds were missing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's founder, Russell Wasendorf Sr., now serving a
            50-year prison sentence for fraud and embezzlement, stole mostly
            from customers who traded on U.S. exchanges, the trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A group of customers that had sued Wasendorf and JPMorgan
            for $200 million also agreed to be part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the bankruptcy was filed, New York-based JPMorgan
            claimed Peregrine owed it $2.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
            comment on the trustee's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-bk-27488, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern
            District of Illinois

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Donskoy Tabak, Russia's largest independent tobacco company, is working with JPMorgan Chase Co.
            (JPM) to help it find a buyer amid a government crackdown on smoking, according to people familiar with the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Privately held Donskoy Tabak may get interest from potential bidders such as
            Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Europe's second-biggest tobacco company, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified because the matter is private. The process may slow or even be halted due to the recent Russian
            conflict with Ukraine, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for Donskoy, Imperial
            Tobacco and JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's second-biggest tobacco market is
            consolidating after the government boosted taxes and restricted both points of sale and smoking in public
            places in a bid to reduce usage. The biggest tobacco wholesaler, Megapolis Distribution BV, sold a 40
            percent stake in December to Philip Morris International Inc. and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donskoy
            Tabak sales climbed 26 percent to 36.2 billion rubles ($1 billion) last year, helped by the tax hike,
            according to the company's website. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were 4.6
            billion rubles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unrest in the region has already led to two other consumer companies
            halting plans to sell shares in Russian businesses to the public. Metro AG last week delayed the initial
            public offering of its Russian Cash Carry unit because market conditions were no longer appropriate. The
            ruble has dropped about 7.7 percent against the euro this year amid the worst diplomatic crisis since the
            Cold War. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donskoy Tabak, owned by entrepreneur Ivan Savvidis, sells own-brand cigarettes
            in Russia and exports to countries including Ukraine. Savvidis's Agrokom Group, based in the southern
            Russian city of Rostov, also processes meat and owns a fishery and real-estate business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            London. JPMorgan is ranked first in investment banking, equities
            origination, fixed income, commodities and currencies, while it
            comes second for derivatives products, according to research
            firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the big themes for the firm is to bring cash
            equities up to that same level,' Throsby said in an interview
            in London. 'There are some very obvious areas where we are
            working to improve, and where we think there is a great
            opportunity. Third or fourth place would be a realistic medium-term ambition, with second or third in the
            long term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender isn't planning to hire more staff to accomplish
            the task, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is betting that investments in electronic
            platforms and hedge-fund services will help it leap over rivals
            in an industry that has suffered from declining volume and
            profitability. The New York-based bank was late in boosting
            those offerings as it focused on advisory and sales, said
            analysts including Derek de Vries at UBS AG. (UBSN) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mizuho, JPMorgan Must Face Interest-Rate Rigging Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) are among about 20 banks and their
            affiliates that must face an investor lawsuit accusing them of
            manipulating benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan said in a
            decision yesterday that the investor, who alleges losses from
            short positions on euroyen Tibor futures contracts, can proceed
            against all the banks with his claim under the Commodity
            Exchange Act for price manipulation and aiding and abetting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investor, Jeffrey Laydon, who seeks to represent other
            investors in a group lawsuit, or class action, said in an
            amended complaint last year that the banks conspired to fix the
            euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate and the London interbank
            offered rate for the yen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have been probing whether firms
            colluded to manipulate interest-rate benchmarks including Libor,
            which affects more than $300 trillion of securities worldwide.
            Financial institutions have paid about $6 billion so far to
            resolve criminal and civil claims in the U.S. and Europe that
            they manipulated benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The probes have have led to fines and settlements for
            lenders including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays
            Plc (BARC), UBS AG (UBSN) and Rabobank Groep. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Wins Dismissal of Employees' Whale Pension Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) won dismissal
            of a lawsuit filed on behalf of current and former employees
            over losses in their retirement accounts allegedly stemming from
            the $6.2 billion 'London Whale' trading debacle. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels in Manhattan today
            dismissed the suit by participants in the retirement plan who
            lost money on company stock after the bank reported a $2 billion
            trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The employees said the bank made misstatements about its
            financial health from January to April 2012, allowing its stock
            to trade at inflated prices. They claim they lost money when
            JPMorgan disclosed its losses publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trading losses came on synthetic credit products, which
            are derivatives tied to credit performance. In disclosing the $2
            billion loss on transactions he said were intended to manage
            risk, JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            cited 'egregious' failures by the bank's chief investment
            office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniels is overseeing lawsuits against New York-based
            JPMorgan tied to trading losses allegedly caused by its chief
            investment office and Bruno Iksil, known as the 'London Whale'
            because of the size of his bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In Re JPMorgan Chase Co. Erisa Litigation,
            12-cv-04027, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Generac's $1.15 Billion Dividend Loan Said to Be Led by JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Generac Holdings Inc. (GNRC)'s $1.15 billion
            term loan supporting a dividend and refinancing is being led by
            JPMorgan Chase Co., which will host a lender meeting tomorrow,
            according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who
            asked not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The generator maker is paying a dividend of as much as $5 a
            share, the company said today in a regulatory filing. The new
            financing will include a $150 million asset-based revolving
            credit line that will be undrawn at closing, Generac said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Generac, based in Waukesha, Wisconsin, will incur about
            $335 million in debt from the payout, according to the filing.
            It has about $801 million outstanding under a term loan due in
            May 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt,
            obtained last year, began paying interest at 5 percentage points
            more than the London interbank offered rate with a 1.25 percent
            minimum on the lending benchmark, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed again
            once it's repaid; in a term loan it can't. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees 20% Drop in Second-Quarter Markets Revenue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank by revenue, said Wall Street's trading
            slump has deepened and could last through the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will drop about
            20 percent from a year earlier at the New York-based company
            amid 'a continued challenging environment and lower client
            activity levels,' JPMorgan said yesterday in its quarterly
            regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
            of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
            was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
            Continued weakness has spurred analysts including Chris Mutascio
            of Stifel Financial Corp.'s KBW unit to ponder whether the drop
            in fixed-income trading might persist through 2014 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's an industry phenomenon, and other banks allow
            JPMorgan to grease the skids for them so there can be a gentle
            letdown process,' said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
            Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 20 percent revenue slide from the $5.37 billion JPMorgan
            posted in last year's second quarter would mean results of $4.3
            billion this period. That figure, along with the first quarter's
            $5.06 billion, would mark the bank's worst first half in trading
            since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

            The results for JPMorgan Chase Co. fell short of analysts' estimates by the most since Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon took over at the start of 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Close

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A judge handling a $2 billion lawsuit
            against banks including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) brought
            by the former Thornburg Mortgage invited their lawyers to file
            statements on the possible appointment of a mediator to resolve
            the dispute, according to a federal court filing in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge, after holding a hearing on the banks' requests
            for dismissal of the suit, gave no deadline for the 'brief
            statements' about a mediator although he said 'quickly
            advised' in a handwritten note filed in court May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks,
            including Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
            of extracting more than $700 million of margin and interest
            payments from the former Thornburg by making 'unjustified'
            margin calls, speeding its failure. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was warned by
            U.S. energy-market authorities that they may take action against
            its employees as part of an inquiry into bidding practices, the
            New York Times said, citing a document it reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enforcement officials at the Federal Energy Regulatory
            Commission plan to recommend the agency hold traders and
            commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters 'individually liable,'
            the newspaper reported, citing a 70-page document the agency
            sent the New York-based bank in March. Investigators said
            Masters falsely denied awareness of problems, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case focuses on eight 'schemes' adopted by traders in
            Houston between September 2010 and June 2011, according to the
            newspaper. The traders offered energy at prices 'calculated to
            falsely appear attractive,' prompting state authorities in
            California and Michigan to make about $83 million in
            'excessive' payments to JPMorgan, the Times cited
            investigators as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was
            transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable
            rules,' the Times quoted Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the
            bank, as saying. 'We strongly disagree with the staff's
            conclusions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Strongly Dispute' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan intends to defend itself and the employees, she
            told the newspaper. 'We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or
            any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who has said he personally owns shares of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), is backing the
            bank's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon as shareholders vote this month on whether to split
            his roles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm 100 percent for Jamie,' Buffett told Bloomberg Television's Betty Liu
            yesterday in Omaha, Nebraska. 'I couldn't think of a better chairman.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon,
            57, to relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since New York-based JPMorgan disclosed risk-control lapses
            on derivatives bets last year that fueled more than $6.2 billion of losses. In March, the company's board
            urged investors to vote against naming a separate chairman at the May 21 meeting, saying that Dimon's dual
            role remains the 'most effective leadership model.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett said in November that Dimon
            would be the best candidate to lead the U.S. Treasury Department in a financial crisis. President Barack
            Obama eventually nominated Jacob J. Lew to the post vacated by Timothy F. Geithner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors
            would risk shortening Dimon's tenure if they appoint a separate chairman and their company's stock may lose
            its 'premium valuation,' Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said last month in a note to
            clients. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s proposal to pay
            $280 million to investors who claimed they were misled in buying
            mortgage-backed securities won preliminary approval from a
            federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Pamela K. Chen issued the order May 2
            granting initial approval to the settlement with investors led
            by the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi. A
            hearing on final approval is scheduled for July 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mississippi pension plan sued in March 2008 on behalf
            of investors who bought $36.8 billion of mortgage-backed
            securities from May 2006 to September 2007, claiming the bank
            misrepresented the offerings for the investments. JPMorgan
            didn't admit to any wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the
            lawsuit, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian J. Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank by revenue, dropped the most in almost a
            month after warning that a deepening Wall Street trading slump
            may last through the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company tumbled as much as 3.4 percent to
            $53.70 before paring the loss to $54.05 at 9:39 a.m. The slide,
            which brought the year-to-date decline to 7.3 percent, was the
            biggest in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. Citigroup Inc. lost
            1.5 percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) fell 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will fall about
            20 percent from last year's second quarter, New York-based
            JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing after the market closed
            last week. The firm blamed 'a continued challenging environment
            and lower client activity levels.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
            of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
            was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
            A 20 percent slide from the $5.37 billion posted in last year's
            second quarter would mean about $4.3 billion from the trading
            business this period. That would mark the company's worst first
            half in trading since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The division's actual results will hinge on its performance
            during remaining months in the quarter, which 'can be
            volatile,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts have cited the Federal Reserve's decision to slow
            its bond-purchasing program for some of the decline, which
            eroded first-quarter results at U.S. financial firms including
            Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Citigroup, Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect that the weakness JPM is experiencing in
            trading-related revenues will be duplicated at other capital-markets-oriented banks,' Charles Peabody, an
            analyst at
            Portales Partners LLC, said today in a research note, referring
            to the bank by its stock symbol. He singled out Citigroup and
            Goldman Sachs as most likely to report weak trading results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which is concentrated more on equities than
            bonds, was alone in registering a trading increase during the
            first three months of 2014, though Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 56, said she saw weakness ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The volumes that we talked a lot about during the first
            quarter -- lower activity -- we're continuing to see that really
            does persist into the second quarter,' Porat said in a
            Bloomberg Television interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave forecasts on other business units. Mortgage
            banking will post a pretax production loss of $100 million to
            $150 million in the second quarter, driven by higher interest
            rates, the bank said. Expenses will be lower than the $59
            billion reported last year, according to the forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First-quarter profit fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion,
            driven by a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income trading, JPMorgan
            said April 11. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Wall Street Lower on Trading-Slump Warning</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) led shares of
            Wall Street banks lower, dropping the most in almost a month,
            after warning that a deepening trading slump may last through
            the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company fell 2.7 percent to $54.08 at 9:58
            a.m., the worst performance in the 83-company Standard Poor's
            500 Financials Index. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
            Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) all lost at least 1.3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will fall about
            20 percent from last year's second quarter, New York-based
            JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing after the market closed
            last week. The firm blamed 'a continued challenging environment
            and lower client activity levels.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
            of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
            was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
            A 20 percent slide from the $5.37 billion posted in last year's
            second quarter would mean about $4.3 billion from the trading
            business this period. That would mark the company's worst first
            half in trading since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The division's actual results will hinge on its performance
            during remaining months in the quarter, which 'can be
            volatile,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts have cited the Federal Reserve's decision to slow
            its bond-purchasing program for some of the decline, which
            eroded first-quarter results at U.S. financial firms including
            Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Citigroup, Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect that the weakness JPM is experiencing in
            trading-related revenues will be duplicated at other capital-markets-oriented banks,' Charles Peabody, an
            analyst at
            Portales Partners LLC, said today in a research note, referring
            to the bank by its stock symbol. He singled out Citigroup and
            Goldman Sachs as most likely to report weak trading results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), which is concentrated more on equities than
            bonds, was alone in registering a trading increase during the
            first three months of 2014, though Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 56, said she saw weakness ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

            quarter -- lower activity -- we're continuing to see that really
            does persist into the second quarter,' Porat said in a

        <headline>JPMorgan at Odds With IMF in Touting Emerging-Market Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S.
            bank by assets, sees no signs of a bubble in emerging-market
            corporate debt, challenging the International Monetary Fund's
            warning on rising risks in the bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by developing-country companies account for just
            3 percent of gross domestic product in these economies, compared
            with 35 percent in the U.S., according to Joyce Chang, global
            head of research at the New York-based bank. Most of the lenders
            selling debt are rated investment grade or backed by their
            governments while maturities have been extended, she said in a
            May 2 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IMF warned last month that some emerging-market
            companies are vulnerable to capital flight if global borrowing
            costs rise further as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws
            its expansionary monetary polices. Corporate debt for developing
            countries tracked by Bank of America Corp. surged to $1.1
            trillion from $411 billion at the end of 2009 as companies took
            advantage of low interest rates to raise cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would really'challenge some of the views from'official
            creditors that emerging-market corporate debt is'the next asset
            bubble,' Chang, who was promoted from head of fixed-income
            research last month amid a leadership reshuffle in the global
            banking division, said in New York. 'The'credit'quality of
            emerging-market'issuance'has been pretty'good.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Olga Stankova, a spokeswoman for the IMF, didn't respond to
            a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Crisis Catalyst &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growth of emerging-market bonds is mostly driven by supply-demand imbalances rather than
            speculation, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rise of developing-country debt has happened after the
            supply of fixed-income products from mature markets shrank
            following the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Chang. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time, banks, pension funds and insurance
            companies are required to hold more bonds in their investment
            portfolio as part of tighter financial regulation, boosting the
            demand for emerging-market securities, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have a structural shift in the market with a supply
            and demand imbalance and emerging markets'have benefited from
            the lack of alternative investment opportunities,' Chang said.
            'The'increase in issuance is obviously something to flag, but
            then you have to look at whether'the issuance is'short-term debt
            for refinancing.'EM issuance is the longest duration within
            fixed income and EM is not facing a wall of maturities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IMF said on April 9 in a report that corporate bonds of
            developing nations are vulnerable in an environment of rising
            global interest rates and slower growth prospects. About $740
            billion, or 35 percent of emerging-market outstanding debt, may
            be at risk of default in a scenario involving a 25 percent
            increase in borrowing costs and a 25 percent drop in corporate
            earnings, according to the Washington-based fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Corporate EMBI Broad Diversified Index returned
            3.8 percent this year through May 2. The gauge lost 0.6 percent
            last year, the first annual decline since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names 2 Replacements for Masters at Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named two
            managing directors, John Anderson and Mike Camacho, to take over
            from Blythe Masters as co-heads of global commodities after the
            bank pulls back from physical products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anderson has been JPMorgan's Houston-based head of non-oil
            energy trading and Camacho has led EMEA commodities in London
            since 2012, the New York-based company said in a memo to
            employees today. Masters, who started as an intern almost three
            decades ago, plans to leave as JPMorgan completes a $3.5 billion
            sale of the physical commodities business to Mercuria Energy
            Group Ltd., according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are confident our franchise will continue to be
            recognized for our commitment to clients, and our dedication to
            providing them with the products they need across a wide range
            of commodities products and services,' according to the memo
            from James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, co-heads of global rates,
            foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is getting out of physical
            commodities amid pressure from regulators and lawmakers. They're
            concerned that banks handling raw materials and energy could
            manipulate prices or endanger the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The replacements for Masters were reported earlier by
            SparkSpread, an industry trade publication. JPMorgan fell 1.6
            percent to $53.34 today in New York, leaving the shares down 8.8
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Investment Banker Warmstein Said to Retire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Eric Warmstein, a managing director in
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s financial-institutions advisory business,
            has retired, a person familiar with the move said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warmstein, 56, left last week after seven years with New
            York-based JPMorgan, the person said, asking not to be
            identified because the move hasn't been announced. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warmstein tied for the No. 1 ranking among bankers advising
            on bank and thrift deals last year, according to SNL Financial,
            a bank research firm in Charlottesville, Virginia. He helped
            advise Umpqua Holdings Corp. in its $2 billion purchase of
            Sterling Financial Corp., SNL data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warmstein joined JPMorgan in 2007 from UBS AG, where he
            worked on transactions such Bank of New York Co.'s purchase of
            Mellon Financial Corp., and Bank of America Corp.'s purchase of
            U.S. Trust Corp., according to a memo at the time. His
            colleagues at Zurich-based UBS included Kenneth Moelis, who
            later founded advisory Moelis Co., and Olivier Sarkozy, now at
            Carlyle Group LP. Before that Warmstein was a merger adviser at
            Credit Suisse First Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's financial-institutions group, led by Fernando Rivas, ranked No. 1 in handling U.S. bank
            deals last year,
            advising on seven transactions worth $5.8 billion, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. That was good for about 47 percent
            of the announced deal volume. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon sees challenges from companies such as
            Facebook Inc. (FB) and Google Inc. (GOOGL) as they seek to provide online
            banking and money-sending services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We move $10 trillion a day,' Dimon said today at the
            Euromoney Saudi Arabia conference in Riyadh. 'We're one of the
            largest payments systems in the world. We're going to have
            competition from Google and Facebook and somebody else.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies are competing for a share of the global
            electronic-payments market worth as much as $1.8 trillion a
            year, according to Capgemini's 2013 World Payments report.
            Google created Wallet, a system using smartphones, and Facebook
            is seeking regulatory approval in Ireland for a service to allow
            users to store money on the site, the Financial Times reported
            last month without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 58, said regulators must decide whether they should
            oversee such companies providing financial services. 'There's
            no way that Google wants to be a regulated bank,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., (AAPL) which has more than 400 million credit cards on
            file at its iTunes Store, is exploring an expansion of the
            mobile-payments system, a person with knowledge of the matter
            said in January. PayPal, the online payments system owned by
            EBay Inc. (EBAY), contributes almost 40 percent of the San Jose-based
            e-commerce company's revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, should oust most of its board and split Jamie
            Dimon's dual roles as chairman and chief executive officer, shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis Co. said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stockholders should replace six of the board's 11 directors at the bank's annual meeting
            May 21 and approve a proposal to name an independent chairman, Glass Lewis said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon, 57, to relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when New
            York-based JPMorgan disclosed risk-control lapses in its chief investment office on credit-derivative bets
            that fueled a $6.2 billion trading loss and sparked regulatory probes. Institutional Shareholder Services on
            May 3 also urged a vote in favor of splitting Dimon's roles and removing three directors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigations
            by the company and lawmakers 'have revealed questionable risk-management practices at both the senior
            management and board levels,' Glass Lewis wrote in the report. 'Shareholders should be concerned that
            company management was allowed to build a massive exposure to credit derivatives,' switch risk models and
            undervalue its losses without triggering a review by the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis said
            shareholders should vote against James A. Bell, former chief financial officer at Boeing Co.; Crandall C.
            Bowles, chairman of Springs Industries Inc.; David M. Cote, CEO of Honeywell International Inc. (HON); James
            S. Crown, president of Henry Crown Co.; Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural

            bankers based in 12 countries, according to its website, though
            it doesn't disclose how many commodity traders it has globally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
            percent last year to $6 billion amid low volatility and reduced
            client activity, according to a Feb. 15 Coalition report.
            Increasing concerns about regulation and capital sensitivity
            also led banks to re-examine commodity strategies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Low Volatility &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Spot Index of raw materials
            climbed less than 0.3 percent in 2012, the worst performance in
            four years. The gauge's 100-day historic volatility fell to as
            low as 14.1 percent in May, from as much as 23.8 percent in
            January 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said in February it will eliminate as many as
            19,000 jobs in mortgages and community banking through 2014 as
            it trims expenses. This year, the bank's headcount will shrink
            by about 4,000 people, mainly through attrition, while some
            employees are redeployed to other areas, said Kristin Lemkau, a
            spokeswoman, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's first-quarter profit rose 33 percent to a record
            last month as the bank shrank expenses by 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Agree to Acquire Tower for $650 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset-
            management unit agreed to buy the 31-story tower at 425
            Lexington Ave. in midtown Manhattan for about $650 million, a
            person with knowledge of the plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A contract to acquire the 750,000-square-foot (70,000-
            square-meter) building is likely to be completed soon, said the
            person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
            private. It's one of two Manhattan towers being marketed by
            Houston-based developer Hines, along with 499 Park Ave.,
            designed by I.M. Pei. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York commercial-property transactions are forecast to
            climb this year as investors globally see Manhattan as a safe
            place to buy real estate. Brokerage Cushman Wakefield last
            month projected sales of $14.6 billion for the first half of
            2013, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alyson Leiter, a Hines spokeswoman, said the company had no
            comment on the planned sale of 425 Lexington. Douglas Harmon,
            senior managing director at Eastdil Secured, who's marketing the
            building, and Darin Oduyoye, a spokesman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Law firm Simpson Thacher Bartlett LLP, the tower's
            primary tenant, with 595,000 square feet on 26 floors, renewed
            its lease through 2033, Hines said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hines bought the glass tower, completed in 1987, for $346
            million in 2003, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
            York-based property-research firm. The building is on the east
            side of Lexington between East 43rd and 44th streets, just north
            of the Chrysler Building. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan agreement was reported by Crain's New York
            Business on its website earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) won dismissal of
            MBIA Inc. (MBI)'s lawsuit over a $1.16 billion pool of mortgages it
            agreed to insure, with the judge saying the bond insurer can
            revise and refile the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There was no evidence MBIA relied on an allegedly altered
            due diligence report for the mortgages that was provided by Bear
            Stearns as an underwriter, said New York Supreme Court Justice
            Alan Scheinkman in White Plains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is one of many still pending against banks over
            alleged misrepresentations in the packaging and sale of
            mortgage-backed securities that helped bring on the 2008
            financial crisis. JPMorgan, which acquired Bear Stearns in 2008,
            agreed in November to pay $13 billion to settle Justice
            Department allegations it defrauded investors in the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Werder, a lawyer for MBIA, didn't immediately
            respond to an e-mail after regular business hours today seeking
            comment on yesterday's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. J.P. Morgan Securities
            LLC, 64676/2012, Supreme Court of New York, County of
            Westchester (White Plains). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was among
            borrowers including State Street Corp. and Statoil ASA (STL) selling
            at least $15.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank issued $2 billion of 1.625 percent,
            five-year notes at narrower relative yields than those on
            similar-maturity debt sold four months ago, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. A spread of 92 basis points more than
            similar-maturity Treasuries compares with an extra yield of 103
            basis points for $1.25 billion of 1.8 percent, five-year
            debentures that New York-based JPMorgan sold Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Statoil, the largest Norwegian energy company, sold $3
            billion of debt in a four-part offering that included $900
            million of 2.65 percent bonds due 2024 that pay 90 basis points
            more than Treasuries, $850 million of 30-year, 3.95 percent debt
            with an extra yield of 95 basis points, $750 million of 1.15
            percent notes maturing 2018 that pay 45 more than benchmarks and
            $500 million of similar-maturity, floating-rate bonds that yield
            29 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;State Street, the third-largest custody bank, sold $1
            billion of 3.1 percent, 10-year bonds that yield 135 basis
            points more than Treasuries and $500 million of 1.35 percent
            debt due 2018 with a spread of 62.5, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other issuers today included Warren Buffett's Berkshire
            Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), HSBC Holdings Plc and Brinker International Inc. (EAT),

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has named Erik Bisso to run the bank's chief investment office for North
            America, according to an internal memo sent today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisso ran agency mortgage-backed securities pass-through
            trading for the New York-based bank, according to the memo, a
            copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. Bill Anast will
            join JPMorgan in August to replace Bisso in that role, a person
            familiar with the matter said. Anast previously ran the agency
            collateralized-mortgage obligation business at Barclays Plc. (BARC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisso's move 'demonstrates our ongoing commitment to
            developing senior talent and encouraging mobility across the
            firm,' Matt Cherwin, head of securitized products, and Craig Delany, who runs the global chief investment
            office, wrote in
            the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisso will replace Irene Tse, the former head of the chief
            investment office in North America, who left the bank last year
            to start a hedge fund, people familiar with the plan said at the
            time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Liz Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan and Brandon

            &lt;p&gt;Bill Rubin, a senior investment analyst at BlackRock Inc. (BLK) who picks financial-company stocks,
            didn't mince words a year ago when he e-mailed JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) right after the bank disclosed a
            trading loss that ultimately cost more than $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are very disappointed by
            this turn in events, not so much by the size of the loss, but more by the bad stumble in risk
            management/controls,' Rubin wrote, according to notes relayed to JPMorgan's management by Sarah Youngwood in
            the bank's investor-relations department. 'Major reputation and sentiment hit, damaging.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackRock,
            JPMorgan's biggest shareholder with a 6.5 percent stake, will cast a key vote this month on whether Jamie
            Dimon should be allowed to retain both his roles as chairman and chief executive officer even after last
            year's stumble. The vote pits Dimon, who runs the world's largest trading business, against BlackRock
            Chairman and CEO Larry Fink, who runs the world's biggest asset-management company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            vote could represent 'a clash of Too Big to Fails,' said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan
            College in Riverdale, New York, invoking the phrase used to describe companies whose collapse is deemed too
            damaging to the economy to be allowed. 'They're both strong personalities.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys $2.8 Billion of Argentine Bonds From Repsol</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S.
            bank, bought $2.8 billion of Argentine bonds at a discount from
            Repsol SA (REP) two days after the oil company received them as
            compensation for the government's seizure of its local unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds, due in 2024, have a nominal value of $3.25
            billion, the Spanish oil producer said in a regulatory filing in
            Madrid. The transaction is expected to close by May 13, and for
            seven days Repsol will refrain from selling its remaining
            Argentine bonds to other parties except under certain
            unspecified conditions, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol, Spain's largest oil producer, is reducing its ties
            to Argentina after receiving $5.32 billion of bonds as payment
            for the government's April 2012 nationalization of the company's
            51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF. JPMorgan probably
            believes it can resell the bonds to investors in the market,
            said Fernando Recalde, portfolio manager at Galileo Argentina SG
            FCI SA in Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This was a way for Argentina to sell bonds indirectly,'
            Recalde said. 'It shows there's appetite for Argentine risk.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentine bonds have returned 11.7 percent this year,
            double the emerging-market average. South America's second-biggest economy hasn't sold bonds in
            international markets since
            its $95 billion default in 2001, and is locked in a dispute with
            some creditors in a case that is now before the U.S. Supreme
            Court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, declined to comment on Repsol's announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'No Hurry' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's global 8.75 percent bonds due 2017, the closest
            in maturity to the 2024 notes, rallied 2.8 cents on the dollar
            today to 93.66 cents, bringing yields down to 11.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Repsol disclosed that it had sold its
            remaining 12 percent equity stake in YPF for $1.3 billion
            through Morgan Stanley, another New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Antonio Brufau, who was Repsol's chief executive officer,
            said Feb. 26 said that the company probably would sell the
            Argentine bonds after receiving them, though it was in no hurry
            to do so. In addition to the 2024 bonds, the Madrid-based
            company received bonds due in 2015, 2017 and 2033. Brufau
            stepped down as CEO last week and is now executive chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said yesterday in a filing that the bonds have
            a market value of $4.67 billion, or $650 million below their
            nominal value. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Wells Fargo in Rolling Out Jumbo Offerings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Todd Vitale, a personal trainer who opened his own gym last year, said he was having difficulty
            getting a mortgage of more than $700,000 to buy a home in Greenwich, Connecticut, because his new business
            was untested. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitale then tried Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender,
            where he kept most of his savings in an account he opened more than a decade ago, he said. He worked with
            the bank's private mortgage unit, whose clients are entitled to loans of up to $6 million and personalized
            service, and had the opportunity to explain that he had already run a similar business and could make the
            gym succeed. Wells Fargo approved his 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of more than $700,000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think I would have gotten a loan unless Wells Fargo private mortgage gave me a shot,' said
            Vitale, 38, who moved in to his new 3,000 square-foot home in February. 'I would have had to walk away from
            the home.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbos, or loans of at least $417,000 in most areas, are one of the few
            thriving pieces of an otherwise shrinking mortgage market. The biggest banks, including San Francisco-based
            Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp., are ratcheting up efforts to win wealthier
            borrowers while keeping credit tight for almost everyone else. Lenders are allowing assets in accounts to
            serve as collateral in lieu of down payments, cutting rates if customers have or set up investment accounts,
            rolling out new adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, and accepting lower down payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Applications
            Increase &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead,' said Paul Miller, a
            banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. based in Arlington, Virginia. 'Big banks need loan growth. If
            they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn't be so aggressive on competing for jumbos.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 4.9 percent in March
            from a year earlier, while requests for loans of less than $150,000 fell by 21 percent, according to the
            Mortgage Bankers Association. The average purchase application loan amount reached $280,500 in the week
            ended April 18, the highest since the survey started in January 1990, the MBA said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbos,
            also called non-conforming loans because they exceed the limit for government-backed Fannie Mae (FMCC) and
            Freddie Mac to guarantee, are loans of more than $625,500 in pricier markets such as Manhattan and Los
            Angeles. They're generally made to the most creditworthy borrowers with FICO scores of 760 on average and
            held by banks instead of being packaged into securities and sold to investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plunging mortgage lending at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. mortgage
            lender, dragged down their first-quarter earnings. Both banks are paring staff, with New York-based JPMorgan
            reducing the number of jobs at its mortgage unit by 30 percent, or 14,000 positions, since the start of last
            year. Wells Fargo got rid of 1,100 jobs in its residential mortgage business in the first quarter to keep
            expenses in line with demand for loans. Bank of America, the fourth-largest mortgage lender, swung to a
            surprise loss in the first quarter on costs tied to mortgage disputes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refinancing,
            which drove lenders' profits last year, fell in the week ended April 25 to the lowest level since 2008,
            according to the MBA, after increases in borrowing rates. While the average rate for a 30-year fixed
            mortgage declined to 4.21 percent this week, it's still up almost a full percentage point from a near-record
            low last May, data from Freddie Mac show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lower Rates &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'That level
            of drop sends everyone everywhere looking for business,' said Joel Kan, director of economic forecasting at
            Washington-based MBA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenders are also vying for jumbos since they don't have to pay
            higher guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to insure the bonds, as they do with conforming
            loans, said Richard Lepre, an Alamo, California-based loan officer with RPM Mortgage. That means they can
            charge lower rates on jumbos, making them more attractive than traditional loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            rate at Wells Fargo for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage was 4.13 percent as of yesterday, compared with 4.25
            percent for a conventional 30-year fixed loan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan modified its guidelines in the
            third quarter for making jumbo loans to take into account a client's total assets at the bank. The bank made
            the change after seeing that customers who had long-term relationships with JPMorgan were less likely to
            default on their loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Leverage Relationships &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender created
            a separate process last year to review all declined loans to ensure those decisions made sense. It also set
            up a group that works with wealthy clients who have more complex financial situations, such as self-employed
            borrowers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We leverage relationships to let the customers know we really want to do
            business with them,' said Lesley Corydon, a senior vice president in the private client mortgage group at
            JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's jumbo mortgage originations represented 21 percent of its total
            originations in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 10 percent a year earlier, according to the bank.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customers of Chase Private Client, who have assets ranging from about $500,000 to $5
            million in total wealth, increasingly are opting to use their deposits and investments as collateral when
            borrowing. Some clients use the credit as bridge loans or to make larger down payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitale,
            the trainer who works with high school and college athletes at his Division 1 Prep gym, said he considered
            going to a non-bank, such as a hedge fund, for his home loan. He said he was dissuaded by the high rates and
            hoops he would have had to jump through to get the loan, compared with getting his Wells Fargo mortgage.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;100% Financing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased to know that Mr. Vitale received
            assistance with his home lending needs,' said Emmanuel Vuillequez, product manager for non-conforming
            mortgages at Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Wells Fargo created a team of 400 underwriters
            spread across six U.S. locations who just focus on jumbo loans. The bank is trying to win more jumbo
            business through better execution, deploying specially trained underwriters who can handle complicated deals
            and complete them by the closing date, Vuillequez said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Jumbo lenders are looking for
            ways to distinguish themselves from other jumbo lenders,' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage
            Finance, a trade publication in Bethesda, Maryland. 'Jumbo lending was the bright star of the mortgage
            market last year, so everyone is looking to ride that momentum into 2014.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Bank of
            New York Mellon Corp., where the average size of a mortgage is $1 million, clients can get 100 percent
            financing. They don't have to put any money down and can instead pledge assets in investment accounts as
            collateral, said Bill Sappington, head of private banking at the New York-based firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Smaller
            Deposits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon earlier this year started offering customers the option to lock in
            mortgage rates for 90 days, instead of the typical 30-day term. The additional days give them more time to
            close knowing the rate is secure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America in October reduced the down payment to
            15 percent from 20 percent for most jumbos of less than $1 million. Existing customers at the bank may
            receive discounts on their mortgages based on their level of business with the firm, said Susan Atran, a
            Bank of America spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, nonconforming
            mortgage originations were 37 percent of overall loans made during the first quarter compared with 22
            percent a year earlier, according to the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RPM Mortgage this year began offering new
            jumbo adjustable-rate mortgages with initial low rates. One of their loan products provides a fixed rate for
            five years at a maximum of 2.63 percent, and then resets once during the next five years to no more than
            4.63 percent, Lepre said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jumbo Defaults &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbo originations are
            still lower than they were before the financial crisis. A decade ago, jumbo ARMs helped fuel the housing
            bubble by letting buyers qualify for homes they could only afford at the low rates before they reset. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When home prices stopped climbing in mid-2006, both jumbo and conventional ARM borrowers began
            defaulting in higher numbers, contributing to the collapse of the mortgage market that in turn led to the
            most severe financial crisis in decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, demand for jumbos is growing as
            borrowers resume buying second homes or investment properties, according to Chase's Corydon. Banks are often
            fighting for loans in the $1 million to $2 million range, said Mike McPartland, head of lending for
            Citigroup Inc.'s (C) private bank in North America. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If in the past, I was competing
            with two private banks, now it feels like I'm competing with two private banks and two regional lenders for
            that $2 million mortgage,' said McPartland, whose clients generally have at least $25 million in net worth.
            'The benefit to working with a bank that knows you is we don't treat a mortgage like an isolated financial
            transaction.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Directors Say Splitting Dimon's Job Could Be Disruptive</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest
            U.S. lender, opposed splitting Jamie Dimon's roles of chairman
            and chief executive officer because the change 'could be
            disruptive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board is made up of directors who are all independent
            other than Dimon and is led by a 'strong' presiding director,
            according to a letter sent today by two directors to
            stockholders of the New York-based company. The structure
            provides 'appropriate accountability to our shareholders and
            counterbalance to the combined CEO/Chair role,' according to
            the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The letter was written by former Exxon Mobil Corp. Chairman
            and CEO Lee R. Raymond, the board's presiding director, and
            former Johnson Johnson Chairman and CEO William C. Weldon, the
            chairman of JPMorgan's corporate governance and nominating
            committee. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Directors Oppose Splitting Dimon's Role as 'Disruptive'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s leading
            directors urged shareholders to reject calls for Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon to relinquish his dual role as chairman and
            chief executive officer, saying it 'could be disruptive' and
            against the best interests of investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An inflexible approach to the question of whether one
            person can serve as both chairman and CEO is not the right
            answer,' according to a letter today sent to shareholders of
            the New York-based company. It was signed by former Exxon Mobil
            Corp. Chairman and CEO Lee R. Raymond, who serves as the board's
            presiding director, and former Johnson Johnson Chairman and
            CEO William C. Weldon, who heads the panel's corporate
            governance and nominating committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proxy advisers at Glass Lewis Co. and Institutional
            Shareholder Services have told investors to vote for a separate
            chairman and oust some directors. Calls for Dimon, 57, to
            relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when
            JPMorgan disclosed lapses in risk controls at its chief
            investment office in the so-called London Whale episode that led
            to at least $6.2 billion in losses on derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS on May 3 urged a vote in favor of splitting Dimon's
            roles and removing three directors. Glass Lewis urged
            shareholders May 7 to oust three members of the four-person risk
            committee as well as all three audit committee members following
            internal and congressional investigations that 'revealed
            questionable risk-management practices at both the senior
            management and board levels.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board's current structure provides 'appropriate
            accountability to our shareholders and counterbalance to the
            combined CEO/Chair role,' according to Raymond and Weldon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan May Evade Power-Trading Ban With Swaps, ISO Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit suspended
            from market-based power trading in California may be evading the
            ban through swap agreements with EDF Group and Cargill Inc.
            subsidiaries, the state's grid operator said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EDF Trading North America LLC signed a swap agreement with
            J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp.'s BE CA LLC unit for energy
            from units at three power plants in California for the six
            months that the JPMorgan subsidiary is banned from trading, the
            California Independent System Operator Corp. said in a filing to
            federal regulators yesterday. Cargill Power Markets LLC has also
            acquired control of units at two plants through a swap contract,
            the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The units covered by the EDF and Cargill contracts
            together comprise the total capacity previously controlled by
            JPMVEC and BE CA LLC in California,' Cal ISO said in the filing
            with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 'There is
            precedent for firms using swap contracts to secure a portion of
            the profit stream from a unit, while masking the identity of a
            party that has some level of control over the bidding.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, was warned by FERC in
            March that its personnel and two subsidiaries may face claims
            stemming from a probe into bidding practices. FERC revoked J.P.
            Morgan Ventures' right to trade power at market-based rates in
            California for six months starting in April, saying the firm
            provided misleading information to the ISO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Internal E-Mails &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC said in September it had initiated a proceeding
            against the energy trading unit focused on whether JPMorgan's
            energy division met its obligations to give documents to the
            ISO. J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy allegedly made bids that
            resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments to the
            generators, according to FERC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigation came to light when the commission went to
            court seeking internal e-mails from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC has stepped up scrutiny of corporations as it wields
            policing powers that were expanded in the wake of Enron Corp.'s
            2001 collapse. The agency has announced since January 2011 at
            least 13 separate investigations of possible market
            manipulation, including probes of energy-trading units at
            Barclays Plc (BARC) and JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Through contracts with EDF and Cargill, JPMorgan could be
            bringing in profits during its suspension 'beyond those
            contemplated' by FERC in its order, Cal ISO said. The operator
            recommended broad changes that would capture any situation in
            which 'a market participant structured transactions to evade
            its suspension of market-based rate authority.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman in New York,
            declined to comment on the California ISO filing, saying the
            company is still reviewing it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deal Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California utility regulators approved a deal yesterday
            under which BE CA LLC would give Edison International (EIX)'s Southern
            California Edison unit all of its rights to energy from power-plant units in California beginning Oct. 1,
            when JPMorgan's
            trading suspension ends. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The tolling arrangement, which runs through May 2018,
            covers power from 12 natural gas-fired units at the Alamitos,
            Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach power plants in the Los
            Angeles Basin area with a total capacity of 3,690 megawatts, the
            resolution approved by the California Public Utilities
            Commission yesterday shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BE CA previously resold some tolling and resource adequacy
            rights from the units to Edison, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a separate proceeding today, FERC granted an April 10
            request from J.P. Morgan Ventures for rehearing on how it'll
            manage electricity sales in power markets outside California
            during its six-month suspension and gave the company 15 days to
            file more information. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused by Harris of Illegal Collection Lawsuits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was sued by
            California over claims that the biggest U.S. credit-card lender
            pursued lawsuits against defaulted borrowers based on
            insufficient evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From January 2008 to April 2011, JPMorgan filed more than
            100,000 debt-collection lawsuits in California, taking illegal
            shortcuts to obtain judgments against consumers, Harris claims
            in the lawsuit filed yesterday in state court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank couldn't have won the judgments so quickly if it
            had complied with minimum consumer protections under state law,
            according to the complaint. Harris said in a statement yesterday
            that the suit was filed to end 'widespread, illegal robo-signing' of court filings without the review of
            relevant files
            or bank records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chase abused the judicial process and engaged in serious
            misconduct against California credit-card borrowers,' Harris
            said in the statement. The lawsuit 'seeks to hold Chase
            accountable for systematically using illegal tactics to flood
            California's courts with specious lawsuits against consumers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            didn't immediately yesterday to phone and e-mail messages
            seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, based on alleged violations of
            California's unfair competition law, JPMorgan sent letters to
            consumers demanding payment of a balance due, claiming they may
            be liable for attorney's fees, and threatening to garnish income
            and place liens on property. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The correspondence is signed by a lawyer, though no lawyer
            reviewed the consumer's file to determine whether the claims and
            amounts due are correct, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is California v. JPMorgan Chase, BC508466,
            California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Be Betting Argentine Securities Will Gain</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) plans to hold
            some of the $3.25 billion of Argentine bonds it bought from
            Repsol SA as a wager the securities will rally and hasn't hedged
            them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the bank's
            strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year notes -- about
            86.6 cents on the dollar -- with the intent to sell them at a
            profit in the secondary market, said the person, who asked not
            to be identified because he isn't authorized to speak publicly
            about the matter. The bank sold some of the notes today and will
            keep some of the securities longer term, the person said,
            without giving amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman at the
            New York-based bank, declined to comment on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've moved about half of the bonds to large emerging-market dedicated investors,' Michael
            Roche, a strategist at
            Seaport Global Holdings LLC, said in a telephone interview,
            citing trades he's observed. 'There's just a growing desire to
            gain exposure to Argentina.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina gave the so-called Bonar bonds due 2024 to
            Spanish oil company Repsol in compensation for the takeover of
            51 percent of YPF SA (YPF) two years ago, in addition to bonds
            maturing in 2015, 2017 and 2033 for a total face value of $5.32
            billion. Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not
            to sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
            closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Hires Vittorio Grilli for Europe Investment Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest securities firm by revenue, hired former Italian Finance
            Minister Vittorio Grilli as chairman of its corporate and
            investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grilli, 56, will be based in London and report to
            investment-banking head Daniel Pinto, according to a memorandum
            to employees sent by Pinto and obtained by Bloomberg News. A
            spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London confirmed the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grilli, who has spent most of his career in the civil
            service, will advise clients on European policy, markets and
            economic developments, according to the memo. Pinto is creating
            the position as he reorganizes the reporting lines after
            becoming sole investment-banking chief in March. Grilli was
            finance minister in Mario Monti's caretaker government,
            replacing Monti in that job in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He worked at the Italian Treasury from 1993 through 2000
            before joining Credit Suisse First Boston in 2001 for a year as
            head of Italian investment banking. After returning to Rome in
            2002 to serve as Italy's general accountant, he became head of
            the Treasury under the governments of Silvio Berlusconi and
            Romano Prodi. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says It Faces Enforcement on Consumer Practices</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, said it will face enforcement action from
            federal regulators over its collection practices and add-on
            products commonly appended to credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said in a May 8 regulatory filing that it
            'expects that its banking supervisors will in the future continue
            to take more formal enforcement actions against the firm,'
            instead of 'issuing informal supervisory actions or criticisms.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is conducting
            an industrywide review of credit card add-on products, which can
            include debt cancellation and identity theft services. New York-based JPMorgan cited an identity theft
            product in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. stopped
            offering such add-on products entirely in the face of regulatory
            scrutiny. The bureau's first enforcement action was against
            Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which paid about $210 million in
            restitution and penalties over the products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Hartwick, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank had no
            comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and deposits, is
            facing regulatory inquiries on its trading practices and conduct
            in the energy business. Shareholders are also considering at
            their May 21 meeting whether to separate the chairman and chief
            executive officer role, both currently held by Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan-Backed Developer Says Slump to Reverse: Corporate India</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Parsvnath Developers Ltd. (PARSV), an Indian
            builder that counts JPMorgan Chase Co. among project
            investors, says sales growth is rebounding after four quarters
            of declines, as rate cuts this year help revive the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real-estate company, which has 190 million square feet
            of land, is introducing new plans for buyers to sweeten offers
            and 'aggressively' selling units to double sales this quarter
            as demand picks up in the world's second-most populous country,
            Chairman Pradeep Jain said in an interview. Quarterly group
            revenue of Parsvnath slid an average 26 percent in 2012,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The overall economic situation isn't very great but is
            recovering,' Jain said in New Delhi, where Parsvnath is based.
            'End-user demand is good, particularly in Delhi and surrounding
            areas. You can see growth in sales from the current quarter.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's central bank has lowered borrowing costs three
            times in 2013, kindling optimism the property market will snap
            out of a slowdown that propelled unsold homes to a record in the
            final quarter of last year. Growth in the $1.8 trillion economy,
            Asia's third biggest, is set to accelerate from an estimated 5
            percent in the 12 months ended March 31, the least in a decade,
            according to government estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Share Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Parsvnath have dropped 37 percent in the past
            year, making it the worst performing stock in the SP BSE India
            Realty Index. DLF Ltd. (DLFU), India's biggest developer whose market
            value of 403 billion rupees ($7.4 billion) is 26 times that of
            Jain's company, has gained 24 percent in the period. The
            benchmark SP BSE Sensex index has climbed 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's private-equity unit had paid 2.6 billion rupees
            in December, 2010 for a 22 percent stake at Parsvnath's La
            Tropicana residential project in the nation's capital, according
            to Jain, while Sun-Apollo Ventures LLC and Red Fort Capital are
            other funds that have invested in its other projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parsvnath has introduced a plan that allows buyers to pay
            25 percent of the property's cost on booking, and the rest while
            taking possession with no extra cost built in and no loans
            involved. The offer, which Jain said will lure buyers and boost
            profit, is for four commercial and 16 residential projects
            across India. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very risky move for a developer, especially if it
            is a falling property market,' said Parikshit Kandpal, a
            Mumbai-based analyst at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. 'The risk is
            entirely on the developer as there's no customer's bank loan to
            back up the sale.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Most Expensive &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Home prices in Mumbai, India's most expensive real estate
            market, rose to a record high of 11,626 rupees a square foot in
            the quarter ended March 31, according to data from Liases Foras
            Real Estate Rating Research Pvt., driven by speculation demand
            will pick up. In the capital region, where Parsvnath operates,
            prices have risen 21 percent since June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the previous quarter, the stock of unsold homes at new
            residential projects climbed to a record, as rising prices
            crimped affordability in the nation's biggest cities, according
            to Pankaj Kapoor, founder of property research company Liases.
            Total unsold inventory of residential stock in the six major
            cities tracked by Liases Foras climbed to 100 million square
            feet (9.3 million square meters), the highest since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interest rates, which are still near a two-year high, and a
            cultural aversion to debt account for India's relatively low
            home-loan penetration rates. Home loan debt of $104 billion is
            equal to 8 percent of gross domestic product compared with 20
            percent in China and 77 percent in the U.S., according to data
            compiled by Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Worst Is Over &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Indian mortgage rates, at 10 percent on average, are among
            the highest in Asia. That compares with about 2 percent in Hong
            Kong, 6.5 percent in China, and 6 percent in South Korea,
            according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The worst for the industry is over, Jain said separately on
            May 9, adding the environment is 'changing for the better.'
            Prices may increase as much as 18 percent annually, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Real-estate stocks in India are looking more attractive as
            borrowing costs decline and demand for homes support property
            prices, according to CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. The 11-member
            SP BSE India Realty Index has rebounded 9 percent from a five-month low reached on April 9. It is still 18
            percent lower than
            its 21-month high reached on Jan. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Residential volumes continued to hold up in the first
            quarter of 2013,' Mahesh Nandurkar and Abhinav Sinha, Mumbai-based analysts at CLSA, wrote in a note to
            clients on April 17.
            'With residential volumes holding well and chances of interest-rate cuts increasing, property stocks are
            offering attractive
            entry points.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rate Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts the Reserve Bank of
            India will extend its rate reductions with four more for a total
            of 1 percentage point through the end of March. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao lowered the benchmark repurchase
            rate in March and May,
            both times signaling there's little space for further cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales volumes have picked up in some markets with signs of
            an economic revival and a rebound in stocks, according to
            Karvy's Kandpal. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram last
            month predicted growth of as much as 6.7 percent in the year
            that started April 1, from an estimated 5 percent in the
            previous 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Over the earlier part of the past 12 months, many issues
            with the sector caused 'a massive underperformance of listed
            realty stock,' Kandpal wrote in a research note last month.
            'There's been a marked shift during the latter part of the last
            six months.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Stock Would Decline 10% If Dimon Leaves Bank, Mayo Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) shares would
            probably fall by about 10 percent if Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon leaves the company, Mike Mayo, an analyst at CSLA
            Ltd., said today in a research note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender's market value would likely drop by about $20
            billion if shareholders vote on May 21 to strip Dimon of his
            chairman role and he leaves as some analysts predict, Mayo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock would suffer because the New York-based bank has
            no obvious successor to Dimon, 57, who is top-ranked among large
            bank CEOs, Mayo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined 0.2 percent to $48.85 at 10:42 a.m. in
            New York. The shares have gained 11 percent this year, compared
            with the 14 percent advance of the 24-company KBW Bank Index. (BKX) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $2 Billion for More Argentina Bonds From Repsol</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
            Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
            billion, bringing its purchases of the country's securities to
            about $5 billion in less than a week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to purchase Argentine bonds due in 2015,
            2017 and 2033, Madrid-based Repsol said in a filing. The oil
            company said last week that it agreed to sell Argentine
            government bonds due in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol's efforts to
            reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
            its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
            Under an agreement Repsol with the government reached earlier
            this year, Repsol last week received $5.32 billion of bonds as
            compensation for the seizure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction disclosed today is expected to be completed
            by the end of this week, according to the filing. Repsol said it
            sold all of its securities due in 2017 and 2033 and all but $117
            million of those due in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol previously had said it received $500 million of the
            2017 securities from Argentina, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds
            and $317 million of those due in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has already sold some of the Argentine
            bonds received from the first purchase, is wagering that its
            remaining holdings will gain in value, a person with direct
            knowledge of the bank's strategy said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
            Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
            billion, bringing its purchases of the Latin American country's
            securities to almost $5 billion in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will buy Argentine bonds due in 2015, 2017 and
            2033, Madrid-based Repsol said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
            The oil company agreed last week to sell new Argentine bonds due
            in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. Those bonds have since
            rallied 1.7 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol's efforts to
            reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
            its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
            Under an agreement reached with the government earlier this
            year, Repsol received bonds last week with a face value of $5.32
            billion as compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has now bought almost all of that. The New York-based bank, which has already sold some of
            the Argentine bonds
            received from the first purchase, is wagering that the remaining
            holdings will gain in value, a person with direct knowledge of
            the bank's strategy said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's bonds, rated seven levels below investment
            grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most in
            emerging markets, as the country took steps to repair ties with
            international investors, including Repsol and the International
            Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Riskiest Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country's debt is still considered risky, with the cost
            of five-year protection in the credit-default swaps market at
            1,567 basis points, according to CMA, the highest in the world.
            The country hasn't sold bonds directly to international markets
            since a $95 billion default in 2001, and it's locked in a
            dispute with some creditors in a case now before the U.S.
            Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction disclosed yesterday is expected to be
            completed by May 16, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale included all of Repsol's Argentine securities due
            in 2017 and 2033 and all except $117 million of those due in
            2015, known as Bodens, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Boden bonds maturing 2015 gained 0.20 cent to 97.65 cents
            on the dollar at 9:31 a.m. in New York, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol previously said it had $500 million of the 2017
            securities, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds and $317 million of
            the 2015 debt. All the securities are governed by Argentine law. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Elliott Said to Buy JPMorgan in Volatility Trade Last Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Elliott Management Corp. built a
            $44.2 million position in JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) during the first
            quarter even as the hedge-fund company's founder said it was

            bank itself, according to a person familiar with the strategy
            who asked for anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, was Elliott
            Management's second-biggest new purchase by market value during
            the three months ended March 31, according to a regulatory
            filing today. The hedge-fund company bought 931,069 shares of
            New York-based JPMorgan, according to the filing. The biggest
            new buy was 2.88 million shares of Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) valued at
            $141.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Singer, Elliott's billionaire president, provoked a
            testy response from Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief
            executive officer, when he criticized the opacity and leverage
            in the global financial system as the two participated in a
            panel discussion about banking regulation at the World Economic
            Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during late January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One doesn't know from disclosures, and one can't find out
            from disclosures, whether each of the very large global
            financial institutions are actually risky or sound,' Singer
            said at the panel, which was broadcast on CNBC. Dimon, 57,
            responded by describing some of the bank's disclosures and
            telling Singer that 'hedge funds are pretty opaque, too.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Advances &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has gained 16 percent so far this year, in line
            with the performance of the Standard Poor's 500 Index and the
            Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which JPMorgan is one of 30
            components. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Singer also advocated separating trading businesses from
            banks funded with federally guaranteed deposits as 'extremely
            useful in normalizing the financial system.' Dimon, whose bank
            had $1.2 trillion of deposits at the end of March as well as
            Wall Street's biggest trading business by revenue, has said that
            big, diverse banks like JPMorgan help the economy grow and can
            be sources of financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At an investor conference in New York last week, Singer
            made it clear that his views on banks haven't changed since he
            spoke in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Four and a half years after the crisis, banks are
            opaque,' Singer said on May 8 at the Sohn Investment
            Conference. 'The financial system is highly leveraged and
            opaque.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sues Portugal-Owned Companies to Enforce Swaps</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sued state-owned
            Portuguese companies running the Lisbon and Oporto metro rail
            services, as well as the country's strategic oil reserves, to
            enforce derivative contracts worth at least 455 million euros
            ($587 million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan filed the lawsuits in London on April 26, the same
            day Portugal made a deal with other banks to reduce its 3
            billion-euro exposure to derivatives entered into by state-owned
            firms. The government failed to reach an agreement with JPMorgan
            and Banco Santander SA's Portuguese unit, and said it would sue
            to defend its interests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We were forced to take protective measures in the English
            courts' following the April announcement by Portugal, JPMorgan
            spokesman Brian Marchiony said in an e-mail. The New York-based
            bank remains open to negotiations and the contracts aren't in
            default, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are turning to U.K. courts to resolve swaps disputes
            with local governments and state-owned companies that say they
            lost money on complex derivatives. More than half a dozen
            Italian municipalities are embroiled in legal disputes with
            investment banks in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Maria Luis Albuquerque, Portugal's secretary of state for
            treasury and finance, described the country's hedging contracts
            as 'toxic' with 'elevated risks,' when she announced the
            April deal. An official at Portugal's finance ministry declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Santander Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Santander's Portugal-based unit also sued the Oporto and
            Lisbon metro and bus companies in London on May 10. Peter
            Greiff, a Santander spokesman in Madrid, didn't immediately
            return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Metropolitano de Lisboa had at least 455 million euros of
            swap contracts with the JPMorgan at the end of 2011, as measured
            by notional value, according to the company's annual report. The
            disclosed JPMorgan contracts had a negative value of 221 million
            euros, Metropolitano de Lisboa said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Marchiony said in an e-mailed statement the
            figures weren't accurate and declined to comment further. A
            Metro de Lisboa spokesman declined to comment beyond the
            company's filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Metro Porto had 120 million euros of outstanding loans with
            JPMorgan at the end of 2011 according to its annual report,
            which didn't disclose details of derivatives held with the bank.
            The Strategic Oil Reserve Fund didn't disclose details of its
            derivative counterparties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are: JP Morgan Securities PLC v. Metropolitano de
            Lisboa EP, High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division,
            Commercial Court, 13-607; JP Morgan Chase Bank NA v. Entidade
            Gestora De Reservas Estrategicas De Produtos, High Court of
            Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court, 13-606; and
            JP Morgan Chase Bank NA Anr v. Metro Do Porto SA, High Court
            of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court, 13-603. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asset Plans U.K.'s First Convertible Investment Trust</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management, the money
            management unit of the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it's
            starting the U.K.'s first investment trust dedicated to global
            convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Global Convertibles Income Fund will be set up
            as a closed-end fund, which has a fixed number of shares,
            targeting a 4.5 percent yield through dividend income and
            capital growth, according to Antony Vallee, the unit's London-based head of convertible bonds. The
            closed-end structure will
            add flexibility to the investment strategy by avoiding the need
            to hold cash and the most liquid securities to meet potential
            withdrawals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Convertible debt combines a bond with an option to buy a
            preset amount of stock, allowing lenders to share in gains from
            the growth or revival of borrowers while offering the same
            protection of capital as a traditional bond. New issuance, which
            soared to more than $10 billion in the first quarter, a record
            for the period in Europe, stalled in recent weeks as improving
            economic indicators in some regions encourage chief financial
            officers and other managers to view their stock as undervalued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Few CFOs in the world are happy to issue convertibles
            because of the dilution,' Vallee said at a presentation
            today. 'Right now they're looking at the U.S. and Japan and
            expecting that equities will go up. When companies need some
            money they will come back.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund plans to raise at least 100 million pounds
            ($152 million) and its size is capped at 300 million pounds. The
            directors plan to prevent its value falling to a discount of
            more than 5 percent to net asset value by buying back stock
            where necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares of the investment trust are expected to start
            trading by the middle of next month, according to the term
            sheet. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads U.S. Bonanza in Basel III Compliant Sales</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are issuing lower-ranked bonds
            and preferred securities in the U.S. at the fastest pace since
            the financial crisis, capitalizing on yield-starved investors to
            satisfy regulatory requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and
            Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) are meeting demands to raise more capital by
            selling $31.8 billion of subordinated debt and preferred shares
            this year, with $22.7 billion in March and April alone,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of issuance is
            the fastest since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders need to sell the notes in part because new
            regulations designed to make banks safer have rendered a
            previously popular form -- called trust-preferred securities --
            useless for capital purposes, ruling it must be replaced by
            2016. Now that banks' creditworthiness has improved, investors
            are snapping up the offerings because they can pay more than one
            percentage point of extra interest over senior bonds that rank
            higher for repayment in a bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'From an investor perspective, it is incremental yield in
            a historically low-rate environment,' Pri de Silva, an analyst
            at New York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a May 6 telephone
            interview. 'The credit profiles of banks are a lot better now
            than they were in the pre-crisis days.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Losing Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo in April sold $2 billion of 5.9 percent
            perpetual securities after initially marketing the debt with a
            higher coupon of as much as 6.125 percent, Bloomberg data show.
            The notes offered interest payments of more than two percentage
            points above the 3 percent senior notes due in 2021 that the San
            Francisco-based bank sold in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Subordinated debt and preferred shares are replacing trust-preferred securities, known as TruPS,
            which were popular before
            the crisis in part because interest payments were tax-deductible. About $149 billion were outstanding at the
            end of
            2008, according to Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks could also count TruPS as Tier 1 capital because they
            allowed issuers to stop paying interest and were supposed to act
            as a buffer against potential losses. Lenders proved reluctant
            to suspend payments during the crisis because those that did
            risked losing other funding on concerns about their solvency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Regulations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators, implementing the international Basel III
            accord and U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, have ruled that banks with
            assets of more than $15 billion can't count TruPS as Tier 1
            capital anymore. They have until 2016 to replace the securities,
            and common equity and preferred shares are the main types that
            count as Tier 1 capital. Subordinated debt counts as Tier 2
            capital, which banks are also required to maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Attention in Europe has focused on additional Tier 1 notes,
            a similar-level as preferred shares in the U.S., where issuance
            has soared this year to $25.7 billion, Bloomberg data show. A
            total of $36.5 billion of the debt is outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Under the new rules, there is a space in the capital
            structure that could be filled with subordinated debt, common
            equity or preferred equity,' de Silva said. The latter two
            'are generally more expensive, so in order to meet that capital
            need cost-effectively, they have been issuing subordinated
            debt.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank Safety &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The issuance comes as confidence in bank creditworthiness
            improves. The average cost to protect against defaults by the
            six-largest U.S. banks fell this week to the lowest level since
            the end of 2007, according to credit-default swaps prices
            compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts, a gauge of the banks'
            risk, are used to hedge against losses or to speculate on the
            ability of companies to meet their obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Without question, the banks are more stable,' said
            Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial Capital LLC.
            'Even under the most extreme economic scenarios, banks should
            have enough capital to withstand a shock, so investors are more
            comfortable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While subordinated debtholders may not be bailed out in
            another crisis, 'people are not particularly worried about that
            right now,' said Kathleen Shanley, a New York-based analyst at
            Gimme Credit LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emboldened by improving bank creditworthiness, investors
            are eager to buy their higher-yielding debt after more than five
            years of near-zero interest rates from the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is this year's biggest bank issuer of the
            securities, selling $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
            The New York-based lender sold $1 billion of perpetual
            securities on March 5 that pay interest of 6.125 percent for a
            decade and then switch to a floating-rate coupon. The notes were
            initially marketed with a coupon of as much as 6.25 percent,
            according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They climbed about 0.1 cent to 101.3 cents on the dollar at
            9:18 a.m. in New York, rising for the sixth consecutive day,
            Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The way the credit markets have been running, almost
            everything that comes is well oversubscribed,' said Thomas Urano, a money manager at Austin, Texas-based
            Sage Advisory
            Services Ltd., which oversees about $10 billion. 'The trends
            have been favorable for banks to be able to place it.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Ventresca, Cristerna as Global M&amp;amp;A Co-Heads</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, named Chris Ventresca and Hernan Cristerna
            as co-heads of global mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ventresca, 46, previously was JPMorgan's head of North
            American MA, while Cristerna, 48, oversaw MA for Europe,
            Middle East and Africa, according to a memo obtained today by
            Bloomberg News. They will report to Jeff Urwin, global head of
            investment banking. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, confirmed the memo's contents.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, is
            overhauling top management on its MA team. Ventresca and
            Cristerna will have global responsibilities, with each
            overseeing their former regions, Pelio said. They will share
            responsibility for deals in Asia, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Combining global MA under two leaders streamlines the
            bank's decision-making, Ventresca said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We can move more quickly with common leadership,'
            Ventresca said. 'When an opportunity arises, we can put the
            right advisory resources in place.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until February, Ventresca shared oversight of North
            American MA with Jim Woolery, 44, who left the company that
            month to become deputy chairman at corporate law firm Cadwalader
            Wickersham Taft LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Surge in Indonesia-Tied Note Sales to 3-Year High</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of structured notes tied to
            Indonesia's sovereign debt surged to the most in three years,
            led by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), as investors seek to capitalize on
            the second-highest yields among major Asian economies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of notes linked to Indonesian government bonds jumped
            to the equivalent of $519.7 million this year through May 14, 89
            percent higher than the same period of 2012, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The volume is the highest since 2010 and
            90 percent of the products were issued by JPMorgan, which rose
            to No. 1 after being ranked eighth last year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas investors pumped a net 18 trillion rupiah ($1.8
            billion) into local-currency sovereign notes in April, pushing
            holdings to a record 299 trillion rupiah, according to the
            finance ministry data. The country's 10-year bonds yielded 5.55
            percent yesterday, the highest behind Indian debt among 14 Asia-Pacific countries tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For foreign investors, Indonesia 'offers high yield, but
            the risk is controllable,' said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, head of
            treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan on May 6 issued the largest notes tied to
            Indonesia this year in a 1.93 trillion rupiah offering. The 20-year securities, issued at a 4.4 percent
            premium, both pay a
            6.625 percent annual coupon and are redeemed in U.S. dollars.
            The U.S. currency gained against the rupiah for two consecutive
            years through 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Polly Leung, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan in Hong Kong,
            declined to comment on the notes. Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) and
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) have also issued the securities this year,
            according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of the products sold this year have
            maturities of 10 years or longer, Bloomberg data show. Such
            tenors are popular among pension funds and other foreign
            institutional buyers, as they tend to seek long-term
            investments, Nurbaeti said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Indonesia on May 14 kept interest rates unchanged for a
            15th consecutive time as predicted. The central bank won't
            resist raising rates if needed, Assistant Governor Hendar said
            May 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Poor's cut its rating outlook on Indonesia's
            debt to stable from positive this month, citing slow progress in
            improving infrastructure, regulatory uncertainty and
            bureaucratic obstacles. The agency ranks the country at its
            highest junk level, while Fitch Ratings Ltd. and Moody's
            Investors Service restored Indonesia to investment grades in
            December 2011 and January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, RBC Win N.J. Tax Grants Valued at $300 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;New Jersey awarded JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
            Co. and RBC Capital Markets $300 million of tax credits over 10
            years after the companies pledged to create 1,900 new jobs in
            Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Economic Development Authority approved annual grants
            of $22.5 million for JPMorgan and $7.9 million for RBC at a
            meeting today in Trenton. JPMorgan's project would add 1,000
            jobs and retain 2,612, while RBC's would add 900 positions,
            according to their applications. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in its application, said it has been evaluating
            the location of its expanding regional technology and operations
            hub. Its options included consolidating multiple New Jersey
            facilities into one in Jersey City or relocating most of those
            operations to lower-cost locations in Delaware and Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBC leases space in five locations in Manhattan with about
            2,700 employees. With leases expiring at One Liberty Plaza and
            the World Financial Center, it began evaluating options,
            including renovating and expanding space in Jersey City and in
            Minnesota. While the one-time cost of expanding would be greater
            in Minnesota, annual operating costs would be higher in New
            Jersey, according to its application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Financial services up in the Jersey City and Hoboken area
            has always been a sweet spot for us,' Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the state's top economic-development
            official, said in
            an interview. 'It's a perfect story: As New York's financial-services sector looks for other places to go,
            they want to look
            some place convenient to New York.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Earners &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The median salary of $120,000 for the covered positions at
            JPMorgan, listed on its application, is more than triple New
            Jersey's median of $35,928, according to the Census Bureau. RBC
            listed the median salary at $126,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financial positions have become increasingly coveted as
            states look to poach jobs from neighbors and even far-away
            locales. Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, today said his
            state is actively recruiting New York companies to move there. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This would not impact the location of our U.S.
            headquarters, which remains in lower Manhattan and will continue
            to house the majority of our employees,' RBC spokeswoman Elisa
            Barsotti said in a statement. 'We are exploring an upgraded
            location to relocate our data center from our ancillary location
            at One Liberty Plaza and support function positions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Two Centuries &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan project is expected to bring a net benefit to
            the state of $1.1 billion over the life of the package and will
            enlarge the company's space in Jersey City to more than 1
            million square feet, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've invested in this community for nearly two
            centuries, and this agreement only deepens that commitment for
            the long term,' JPMorgan Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames
            said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guadagno, a Republican who serves as the state's economic
            development chief, said New Jersey has aggressively courted
            financial-services jobs with a message to decision makers to
            keep their New York address and move support jobs to New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jersey City, a community of 254,000 one stop from Manhattan
            by train, has worked in the past decade to re-craft itself as
            Wall Street West. Mayor Steven Fulop, 37, worked at Citigroup
            Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., leaving after the 2001 World
            Trade Center attacks to join the U.S. Marine Corps and serve in
            Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lifting State &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jersey City is leading the state economy in terms of job
            creation and is the driving force in lifting New Jersey out of
            the recession,' he said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New Jersey has struggled to shake off the lingering effects
            of the U.S. recession that ended in 2009. Governor Chris Christie's administration said yesterday that the
            jobless rate
            slid to 6.9 percent in April, the first time it has dipped under
            7 percent since November 2008. The national level was 6.3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The state has regained 125,700 jobs, or about half of those
            lost during the slump. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers
            Economic Advisory Service, said this month that the state isn't
            expected to recover all of them until 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Citigroup, JPMorgan Shortlisted to Advise on Slovak Telekom Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) were shortlisted to advise Slovakia on a 1 billion-euro
            ($1.4 billion) sale of the country's largest phone company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government's National Property Fund, which oversees
            state-asset sales, will by the end of May pick one or both banks
            to advise on the sale of a 49 percent stake in Slovak Telekom
            AS, Miriam Ziakova, a spokeswoman for the fund, said by phone
            today. The sale will be completed by the end of the year, she
            said. Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) owns 51 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slovakia is selling assets to raise funds for cutting
            public debt, which last year exceeded 55 percent of gross
            domestic product. The Finance Ministry estimates that Slovak
            Telekom's sale will bring in the equivalent of 1.3 percent of
            GDP next year, according to its budgetary framework for 2015
            posted on the government's website last month. The ministry
            forecasts 2015 nominal GDP at 77.8 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government prefers to sell its shares in an initial
            public offering, according to a memorandum between the state and
            Deutsche Telekom. The German operator, which bought its stake in
            the former fixed-line monopoly in 2000, has a pre-purchase right
            if a direct sale to an investor is chosen, the memorandum says. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dexia Suit Against JPMorgan Revived, Sent to N.Y. Court</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Dexia SA (DEXB)'s lawsuit against JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) over about $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed
            securities was revived by a federal judge who found that he had
            lacked the jurisdiction to dismiss it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan issued an order
            today vacating his April decision and sending the case to New
            York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Those who don't believe in ghosts have never been in
            court, where legal claims are regularly seen rising from the
            grave,' Rakoff wrote in his order. 'This is a case in point.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rakoff last month dismissed most of the suit, in which
            Dexia accused JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual
            Inc. of 'egregious fraud' in the sale of mortgage bonds.
            Dexia, based in Brussels, sued the lenders in 2012, claiming
            that loans backing securities purchased between 2005 and 2007
            were riskier than promised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased assets of Washington Mutual and Bear
            Stearns after they collapsed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Rakoff's April ruling, a federal appeals court in
            Manhattan found that the Edge Act, a law that regulates
            international banking, didn't give a federal court jurisdiction
            over a similar lawsuit filed by American International Group
            Inc. against Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In light of that decision, Rakoff concluded that he didn't
            have jurisdiction over Dexia's case and that it belonged in
            state court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on Rakoff's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns Co., 12-cv-04761.
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon prepares for a vote tomorrow on whether he should keep
            his chairman and chief executive officer titles, he may take comfort knowing most of his biggest
            shareholders are led by men with the same dual role. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven of JPMorgan's 10 largest
            owners -- including top five BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Vanguard Group Inc., State Street Corp. (STT), Wellington
            Management Co. and FMR LLC -- are run by CEOs who are also chairmen. The top 10 hold a combined 29.5 percent
            of New York-based JPMorgan's stock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People just like
            him are going to vote on this,' said Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan
            in Ann Arbor. 'If you've told your own board that the best structure for the sake of the company is to
            combine the roles, then how do you turn around and say, 'But that's not true for JPMorgan?'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of
            JPMorgan's top 10 shareholders, only Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price, the seventh-biggest with a 2.15 percent
            stake, has commented publicly on Dimon's role. Brian Rogers -- T. Rowe Price's chairman and chief investment
            officer, and not the CEO - - said in a May 16 statement that 'I fully support the combined chairman and CEO
            role at JPMorgan under the superb leadership of Jamie Dimon.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Invest $100 Million in Detroit, Detroit News Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) plans to invest
            $100 million to revitalize Detroit, the Detroit News reported,
            citing three people with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest investment bank by revenue, plans to
            back firms that promise to provide jobs and invest in the city,
            which is going through the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy,
            the newspaper reported today. The investment, over five years,
            will include loans and grants, the Detroit Free Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move follows as much as $15 million in loans to Detroit
            small businesses by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), and signals Wall
            Street's rising interest in Michigan's largest city, which faces
            $18 billion in long-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman of New York-based JPMorgan, is
            expected to meet with Mayor Mike Duggan, a representative of
            Republican Governor Rick Snyder's office, and possibly
            billionaire Warren Buffett before the plan is detailed on NBC's
            'Today Show' tomorrow, according to the Detroit News. Dimon
            discussed the plan with Snyder in April in New York, the
            newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's program would provide guidance and services
            including consulting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duggan and Steve O'Halloran, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined
            to comment on the report. Buffett didn't immediately respond to
            a request for comment sent to an assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in November that the New
            York-based bank would make loans to small businesses in the
            Detroit area and provide education and other assistance as part
            of its 10,000 Small Businesses initiative with Buffett. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investcorp Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment firm, hired JPMorgan Chase Co. to sell
            Spanish ceramics-products maker Esmalglass SA, according to
            people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction may value the Villarreal, Spain-based
            company at about 800 million euros ($1.1 billion), the people
            said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private.
            Esmalglass wants to reach an agreement before year-end, they
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investcorp's preferred option is a sale to a private-equity
            firm or another manufacturer, the people said. An initial public
            offering of Esmalglass is still a possibility, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investcorp agreed to buy a majority stake in Esmalglass
            from 3i Group Plc (III) in August 2012 in a deal valued at about 200
            million euros, the people said. Debt provider Intermediate
            Capital Group Plc also took a minority equity stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esmalglass, which was founded in 1978, employs about 1,000
            people in eight countries, according to the company's website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to HSBC Accused by EU Over Rate-Rigging Cartel</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings
            Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) were accused today by the European
            Union's antitrust arm of colluding to manipulate interbank
            lending rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trio received antitrust complaints alleging they
            participated in a cartel to rig Euribor. The so-called statement
            of objections is the next step in the EU enforcement process
            after the lenders dropped out of settlement talks last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission 'has concerns that the three banks
            may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at
            distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro
            interest rate derivatives,' it said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While six financial firms, including Societe Generale SA (GLE),
            agreed in December to a combined record of 1.7 billion euros
            ($2.3 billion) in fines in the Euribor case and a similar yen
            Libor probe, the regulator's attempt to get a clean sweep of
            settlements was ruined by the dropouts. The EU's case was
            further undermined when Societe Generale appealed its penalty in
            the courts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC fell 1 percent in London trading as of 1:04 p.m. while
            Credit Agricole slipped 0.5 percent in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Without Merit' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and HSBC said in separate statements that they
            would defend themselves against the EU allegations. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Bank Cut by JPMorgan on Concern Over Capital</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), continental
            Europe's biggest bank, was cut to neutral from overweight by
            JPMorgan Chase Co., which said tighter regulation threatens
            capital levels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposed
            revision to a securitization framework governing riskier assets
            would reduce Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank's common equity Tier
            1 capital ratio under Basel III rules to as little as 8.6
            percent in 2014 from 10.2 percent, JPMorgan analysts including
            Kian Abouhossein said in a report to clients from London today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reversing an increase to Deutsche Bank's rating three weeks
            ago, JPMorgan said a 3 billion-euro ($3.9 billion) capital
            increase on April 30 'was clearly a defensive move' to offset
            the impact of 'potential capital 'curve balls' such as Basel
            securitization proposals.' Regulators may publish the final
            rules next year, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank fell as much as 3.6 percent to 36.16 euros in
            Frankfurt trading, heading for the biggest drop in a month. The
            stock will trade at 'a high implied risk premium' compared
            with other European banks, rising to 38 euros by December, the
            analysts said. JPMorgan prefers Barclays Plc (BARC), they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rules' Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are overhauling capital rules after widespread
            securitization, or repackaged assets that are sliced up and sold
            on to clients, in the U.S. mortgage market contributed to the
            financial crisis by spreading risk from lenders to the so-called
            shadow-banking industry. Banks have written to the Basel
            committee to say the plans, which will force them to hold more
            reserves against such products, will tie up capital and starve
            the economy of credit. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s risk committee
            could undergo changes in its membership, said Lee R. Raymond,
            the bank's lead director. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In terms of the composition of the risk committee, you
            should stay tuned,' Raymond said today at the firm's annual
            meeting in Tampa, Florida. He was responding to a question from
            Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., on why the board didn't
            overhaul the committee following last year's risk-management
            failures in the chief investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shareholders are scheduled to vote on three members of the
            risk committee, including Ellen Futter, 63, David Cote, 60, and
            James Crown, 59. Futter, president of the American Museum of
            Natural History in New York, wasn't able to attend the
            shareholder meeting, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A majority of preliminary ballots supported the three risk-committee members, according to the New
            York Times. Among them,
            Futter received the least support, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futter didn't immediately respond to phone and e-mail

        <headline>JPMorgan Shareholders Reject CEO-Chairman Split in Win for Dimon</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon won shareholder support to remain chairman,
            surviving a campaign to split the roles after a record trading
            loss at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposal to divide Dimon's duties won 32.2 percent of
            the votes, down from 40 percent last year, the bank said today
            at its annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. Dimon, 57, had told
            some investors he might quit if the non-binding measure passed,
            according to a person with knowledge of the conversation, who
            requested anonymity because the discussion was private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The vote to back Dimon, who guided JPMorgan to three
            straight years of record profit, is a defeat for investors who
            say companies need the balance of a separate chairman and CEO.
            While Dimon can keep both jobs, the vote may spur JPMorgan's
            directors to tighten how they oversee the company after
            last year's $6.2 billion 'London Whale' trading loss and
            identify a future successor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan changes after this annual meeting season, even
            if all the votes go in the direction' JPMorgan wanted, Michael Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., told Bloomberg
            Television's Erik
            Schatzker in Tampa today. The bank could give more authority to
            lead director Lee R. Raymond, the former chairman and CEO of
            Exxon Mobil Corp., or split Dimon's roles after he leaves, a
            person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Invest $100 Million in Detroit Revival Over 5 Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is investing
            $100 million over five years to revive bankrupt Detroit, marking
            the bank's largest commitment to a city. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will provide funds for community development,
            blight removal, job training, small-business support and other
            growth programs, the biggest investment bank by revenue said
            today in a statement. The move follows as much as $15 million in
            loans to Detroit small businesses announced by Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) in November, and signals Wall Street's rising
            interest in the erstwhile auto-manufacturing capital, which
            faces $18 billion in long-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe in Detroit's future, and we want to see the
            city recover its economic strength,' Jamie Dimon, chairman of
            New York-based JPMorgan, said in the statement before a luncheon
            with community and government leaders in Detroit today. 'With
            this investment, we are putting our resources and expertise to
            work to help Detroit chart a course back to economic
            prosperity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank's commitment includes $40 million
            in flexible, long-term debt capital and $10 million in grant
            capital to two community-development lenders. Another $25
            million will help end residential blight and restore properties,
            and $12.5 million will go toward work-force training and
            development. The investment also offers $7 million to support
            small businesses and $5.5 million in strategic initiatives,
            including investing in a new rail line. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seen Waiting on Board Changes After 'Stay Tuned' Remark</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s board, whose
            top director told investors yesterday to 'stay tuned' for
            changes to its risk committee, isn't likely to add new members
            immediately, according to two people with knowledge of the
            board's thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board isn't seeking to replace current members and may
            take months to make any additions, the people said, asking not
            to be named because the talks are private. Lead director Lee R. Raymond, 74, wants to strengthen the New
            York-based firm's board
            by adding executives with more experience in finance and
            accounting after some shareholder groups opposed re-electing as
            many as six risk- and audit-committee members, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 11-member board doesn't see a need to rush additions to
            those two panels after shareholders voted yesterday in favor of
            every member and increased support for Jamie Dimon's dual roles
            as chairman and chief executive officer, the people said. Three
            of the risk committee's four members received less than 60
            percent support from shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In terms of the composition of the risk committee, you
            should stay tuned,' Raymond told investors yesterday at the
            annual investor meeting in Tampa, Florida, shortly before the
            preliminary voting results were made public. Kristin Lemkau, a
            spokeswoman for the bank, declined to comment on the board's
            plans. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest bond dealers,
            including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley, failed to
            properly report trades to the industry's price-tracking system
            more than 11,000 times. JPMorgan's penalty: About three minutes
            of its annual profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fines levied in settlements disclosed last month by the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority amounted to a fraction
            of what the two New York-based firms generated from trading debt
            during the two-year reviews. JPMorgan's $95,000 penalty was the
            biggest imposed by Finra as it cited at least three other
            dealers in the past five months for similar types of violations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are seeking to uphold the integrity of the bond-price reporting system known as Trace,
            the biggest window into a
            market that's grown about 78 percent since 2008 as investors
            poured money into debt securities. Holding back information on
            trades can give Wall Street dealers an advantage over customers
            seeking a fair price, undermining Finra's stated goal of equal
            access for all participants to real-time data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If non-reporting is systemic, then that's concerning
            because the broader market looks to this data as the golden
            source,' said Kevin McPartland, head of market-structure
            research at consulting firm Greenwich Associates. 'It's the
            best we've got when people try to understand who is doing what

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co. is planning its
            second sale of U.S. home-loan securities without government
            backing since the financial crisis the debt helped to trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds will be backed by $443 million of 'high-quality' so-called jumbo mortgages, according to
            statements e-mailed today by Kroll Bond Rating Agency and DBRS Ltd., which
            expect to grant top grades to most of the notes. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
            immediately
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, like a $616.3 million transaction in March by the
            New York-based bank, contains relatively weak contractual
            promises that lenders or the issuer will repurchase loans that
            fail to match their promised quality, DBRS said. Sellers have
            begun taking different approaches to those terms as issuance in
            the so-called non-agency mortgage-bond market revives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, 'the representations and warranties framework in
            this transaction does show some improvements' from JPMorgan's
            last deal, including how fraud is defined, DBRS analysts
            including Claire J. Mezzanotte and Quincy Tang said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DBRS and Kroll said that they took the weaker provisions
            into account in assigning grades to the securities. Fitch
            Ratings, which will also rate most of the notes, said in a
            report that it was not asked to rank a $13.7 million slice
            granted AAA ratings by those two firms. The risk of
            the debt means it deserves an AA grade, two levels lower, Fitch
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Slow Acceleration &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of non-agency bonds has been tied to about $6
            billion of new loans this year, increasing from about $3.5
            billion in all of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Barclays Plc analysts said in a May 21 report that the expansion
            will be slow to accelerate and maintained a 2013 forecast of $12
            billion to $15 billion. Sales peaked at about $1.2 trillion in
            each of 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The relative yields buyers demand on the bonds have been
            widening as issuance increases and amid investor concern that
            government-backed housing debt offered better value and that the
            mortgages will prepay slower than expected if interest rates
            rise or faster if they fall. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A May 17 offering by Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT) included $299
            million of top-rated bonds that priced to yield 2.82 percent, or
            1.90 percentage points more than benchmark swap rates. That
            compared with spreads of 1.75 percentage points on similar
            securities sold last month by the Mill Valley, California-based
            firm and as low as 0.97 percentage point in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jumbo home loans are larger than allowed in government-supported programs, currently as much as
            $729,750 for single-family properties in high-cost areas. For Fannie Mae and Freddie
            Mac loans with the lowest costs for borrowers using 20 percent
            down payments, limits range from $417,000 to $625,500. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Fined $4.5 Million for Wealth Management Failings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. markets regulator fined a
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit 3 million pounds ($4.5 million) for
            failing to keep up-to-date records of clients and lacking risk
            and compliance controls. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senior management at JPMorgan International Bank didn't
            have 'sufficient information and oversight tools' to correct
            the problem in its wealth management business for two years, the
            London-based Financial Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed
            statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Customers of wealth managers should be able to expect the
            firm to keep complete, up-to-date client records so that they
            can give the right advice,' Tracey McDermott, director of
            enforcement and financial crime at the FCA, said. 'In this case
            the firm did not have complete records, nor did its management
            have the information they needed to recognize this. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator said that the bank's computer-based record
            system didn't hold sufficient information and that its
            suitability reports didn't have adequate statements about client
            needs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have fully cooperated with the FCA and have enhanced
            our procedures to ensure that they are compliant with regulatory
            requirements,' the bank said in an e-mailed statement. 'As the
            FCA has noted in its press release, there has been no detriment
            to customers identified to date.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Is Hired by Russia to Promote Sovereign Credit Rating</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's Finance Ministry hired
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) the biggest U.S. lender, to help boost the
            country's standing among credit-rating companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was chosen after beating proposals from other
            investment banks, the ministry said in a statement on its
            website, without naming the other firms. Natalia Shchetinina, a
            JPMorgan spokeswoman in Moscow, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia has long complained of bias by the three U.S. rating
            companies that dominate the industry. President Vladimir Putin
            said in 2011 the rankings given to Russia were an 'outrage'
            that increased borrowing costs for domestic companies and the
            government. The country has 'more than earned' an upgrade,
            Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy exporter last had its debt score
            changed by one of the three U.S. companies in February 2009,
            when Fitch Ratings cut it one level to BBB, three steps below A
            and two above junk. That came three months after Standard
            Poor's did the same. Moody's Investors Service has held Russia
            at Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade, since July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP and Moody's have said Russia's reliance on oil revenue,
            which makes the budget vulnerable to swings in commodity prices,
            outweighs the low level of sovereign debt. Russia plans to
            follow last year's sale of $7 billion in euro bonds with another
            offering of the same amount in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in February it had been hired
            by the government to burnish Russia's image overseas and attract
            institutional investors. The New York-based bank signed a three-year agreement with the Economy Ministry and
            the Russian Direct
            Investment Fund to advise on issues such as communicating
            government decisions and setting up meetings with investors,
            according to Sergei Arsenyev, Goldman Sachs's managing director
            of investment banking in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and New York-based JPMorgan are on a list of
            23 foreign and domestic banks selected to advise Russia on its 1
            trillion-ruble ($33 billion) privatization program. Last year
            both American investment banks helped advise OAO Sberbank,
            Russia's largest lender, on a $5.2 billion equity sale. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>StanChart, JPMorgan, NCB Capital to Manage Saudi Telecom Sukuk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) hired Standard
            Chartered Plc, JPMorgan Chase Co. and NCB Capital to market
            its debut Islamic bond as companies in the oil-rich kingdom
            increasingly tap the debt market for funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will manage the potential sale under a 5-billion
            riyal ($1.3 billion) sukuk program, Saudi Telecom said in a
            statement today. The size of the private local placement will
            depend on market conditions, it said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian companies are diversifying their financing
            sources as the Arab world's biggest economy spends billions of
            dollars to develop infrastructure. Banque Saudi Fransi, the
            lender part owned by Credit Agricole SA, is planning to raise
            about 2 billion riyals to bolster its capital base, while Saudi
            airliner Flynas is considering a sukuk sale to fund its
            expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While riyal-denominated local private placements have been
            the preferred option for many companies, others have started to
            venture into sales abroad. Saudi Electricity Co., (SECO) the state-owned utility, last month raised $2.5
            billion from sale of two-part sukuk to international investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Telecom's sukuk plan comes after Mohammad Al
            Kharashi, the governor of the state-run Public Pension Agency,
            earlier this month said he welcomed more sukuk offerings. The
            power utility, majority owned by the government, reported a 54
            percent increase in first-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Pinto Says Clients Cautious After Trades Went Wrong</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank by revenue, said a pair of wrong-way
            bets made by clients at the start of the year is partly to blame
            for Wall Street's trading slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest wagers included shorting Japan's
            currency and betting that U.S. interest rates would rise more
            steeply than those in Europe, according to Daniel Pinto, head of
            the New York-based firm's corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Neither of those trades paid,' Pinto, 51, said today at
            an investor conference in New York. 'Essentially you start the
            year with the wrong momentum, where you lose money at the very
            beginning, and you ended up with probably a lower risk appetite
            than you would have otherwise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan warned investors earlier this month that second-quarter markets revenue will probably drop
            about 20 percent from
            a year earlier, after a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income,
            currencies and commodities trading in the first quarter. That
            would amount to JPMorgan's worst first half for trading since
            the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another reason for the lackluster results is reduced
            volatility, which has dropped to the lowest in 10 to 15 years
            for rates, currencies and credit trading, Pinto said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When 'the market doesn't move, it's really difficult to
            monetize your flows,' Pinto said. 'It makes the market more
            competitive and margins really tighten because it costs you very
            little to provide liquidity, so you provide a lot.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Episodic Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clients appear to be hesitating in placing the larger
            hedges that typically happen earlier in the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have episodic trades, big hedges, big corporate
            trades, that happen along the year,' Pinto said. 'Particularly
            in the first and part of the second, the amount of those trades,
            even though the pipeline is very healthy, they haven't happened.
            It looks like they are going to happen later in the year, and
            that is a big swing factor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The industry's shrinking results are being caused more by
            low volatility and monetary policy than by new regulations, he
            said, adding that investment banks may have to wait until 2016
            before revenue improves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Probably we will have a flattish year next year, and then
            probably with all that we talked about before -- markets will
            grow, normalization of interest rates -- all that will sort of
            bring revenues up again,' Pinto said. 'It's probably a bit
            more down the line.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;</body>

            funds, money managers and other mid-sized financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Machen, 37, was co-head of Morgan Stanley's North American

        <headline>JPMorgan, Chicago-Based Funds Settle Mortgage Bond Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and a Chicago-based group of funds agreed to settle a lawsuit in which the
            funds claimed JPMorgan gave faulty information involving
            residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AMF Funds sued JPMorgan in New York State Supreme Court in
            Manhattan in February 2012, accusing the bank of making
            'material representations and omissions' on underwriting
            standards used to make mortgage loans pooled into $515.6 million
            of securities purchased from May 2003 to May 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two sides have reached an agreement in principle to
            settle the suit, according to letters filed by both sides in the
            past week. Watertown Savings Bank, a Massachusetts lender and
            former shareholder of AMF Funds, has asked to intervene in the
            case, which both sides oppose. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AMF Funds, managed by Shay Assets Management Inc., had
            about $590 million in assets under management in 2011, according
            to its website. Mark Arisohn, an attorney with Labaton Sucharow
            LLP representing the funds, and Darrell S. Cafasso, a lawyer
            with Sullivan Cromwell LLP for JPMorgan, didn't immediately
            return telephone calls seeking comment on the letters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
            part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
            biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
            and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
            market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Asset Management Fund v. JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            650320/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused by Los Angeles of Discriminatory Lending</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The city of Los Angeles accused
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) of targeting minority borrowers with
            predatory loans in a lawsuit filed two days after Wells Fargo
            Co. (WFC) lost a court bid to dismiss a similar case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. city sued Wells Fargo, Citigroup
            Inc. and Bank of America Corp. last year, saying the lenders
            engaged in biased practices since at least 2004 by placing
            minority borrowers in mortgages they couldn't afford and driving
            up the number of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'L.A. continues to suffer from the foreclosure crisis,
            from blight in our neighborhoods to diminished revenue for basic
            city services,' City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.
            'We're fighting to hold those we allege are responsible to
            account.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The claim against New York-based JPMorgan is the most
            recent in a series of lawsuits by municipalities across the U.S.
            to hold mortgage lenders responsible for fallout from the
            collapse of the housing market. Yesterday, Providence, Rhode
            Island, sued Banco Santander SA (SAN)'s U.S. unit, alleging
            discriminatory lending in the years after the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In today's suit and earlier ones by Los Angeles, the city
            accuses the banks of historically 'red-lining' black and
            Hispanic areas as no-loan zones. Starting in the late 1990s, the
            banks engaged in 'reverse red-lining' by flooding the areas
            with subprime mortgages even when minorities qualified for
            better terms, according to the complaint filed today in federal
            court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fair Terms' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition, JPMorgan has since 2009 declined to offer
            refinancing or loan modification to minority customers on 'fair
            terms,' according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are disappointed the L.A. city attorney is pursuing an
            adversarial approach to address city finances impacted by the
            recent economic downturn,' JPMorgan spokeswoman Suzanne Ryan
            said in an e-mailed statement. 'The downturn was beyond our
            control.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Counties encompassing Chicago and parts of Atlanta have
            made similar claims in lawsuits against units of Bank of America
            and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The banks deny the claims, which allege
            violations of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is City of Los Angeles v. JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            14-cv-04168, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
            (Los Angeles.) &lt;/p&gt;

            New York-based JPMorgan, named Kenny and Rohrbaugh co-heads of
            global rates, foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets
            last month. Pinto, 51, is overhauling reporting lines across the
            division after becoming its sole chief following Cavanagh's move
            to private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pluta, Robinson &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thomas Pluta, global head of foreign-exchange forwards
            trading, will have added responsibility as global head of short-term interest-rate trading, according to the
            memo. Pitts Robinson will be global head of foreign-exchange services to
            deliver FX products to clients, and Eddie Wen was made global
            head of electronic trading for the four areas overseen by Kenny
            and Rohrbaugh. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jury previously oversaw global foreign-exchange spot
            trading and Thakur ran rates and currencies in Asia, excluding
            Japan. Stephen Jefferies was named head of emerging markets and
            Europe, Middle East and Africa foreign exchange, reporting to
            Jury and Thakur, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reporting to Bhagat will be Charles Bristow, who was named
            head of derivatives and liquid government bonds in Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, and Carl Norrey, who will manage
            sovereign credit default swap trading and non-liquid European
            government bond trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, also named Jeff Herbert-Smith as head of Australia
            markets, expanding his role
            managing fixed-income trading to include equities. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, said it's cooperating with various government
            authorities investigating the firm's foreign-exchange trading
            business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These investigations are in the early stages and the firm
            is cooperating with the relevant authorities,' the New York-based company said today in a quarterly filing
            with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. (C) put their top London currency
            dealers on leave after regulators probing the manipulation of
            foreign-exchange rates started investigating the traders' use of
            an instant-message group, three people with knowledge of the
            moves said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are focusing on an instant-message group the
            traders set up to share information about their positions and
            client orders over a period of at least three years, four people
            with knowledge of the probe said last month. The roster of banks
            in the group changed as the men moved firms and also included
            Barclays Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG, three
            people with knowledge of the communications said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigators are weighing whether the messages amounted to
            attempts to manipulate the market, two people said. The five
            firms account for about 47 percent of the $5.3 trillion-a-day
            foreign-exchange market, according to a May survey by Euromoney
            Institutional Investor Plc. Two other traders, who weren't part
            of the conversations and who asked to not be identified because
            they do business with those involved, said that they and others
            in the market referred to the message group as 'The Cartel.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Chase Traders Extend Perfect Record Into Third Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) traders
            generated profits every day in the third quarter, extending
            their perfect record for 2013 as the Federal Reserve backed off
            plans to curtail a bond-purchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders made more than $200 million on three days this
            year, JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. The New York-based company is the biggest U.S. lender by
            assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street has been whipsawed as the Federal Reserve
            debates whether the economy is strong enough to justify reducing
            monthly bond purchases of about $85 billion that have kept
            borrowing costs low. Ten-year Treasury yields, which are used to
            set rates for some consumer and corporate loans, rose from this
            year's low of 1.63 percent on May 2 to 3 percent on Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading revenue at JPMorgan's corporate and investment
            bank, run by Daniel Pinto and Michael Cavanagh, fell 2 percent
            to $4.69 billion in the third quarter, the bank said when it
            reported earnings on Oct. 11. Fixed-income trading revenue
            declined 8 percent to $3.44 billion from a year earlier while
            equity-trading revenue rose 20 percent to $1.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, disclosed that authorities in the U.S. and abroad are
            investigating the lender's hiring practices in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has received subpoenas from the Securities and
            Exchange Commission and document requests from both the SEC and
            the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a company filing
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorities in the U.S. and abroad are looking at the
            bank's employment of people referred by clients, potential
            clients and government officials as well as hiring 'of certain
            former employees in Hong Kong, its business relationships with
            certain related clients in the Asia Pacific region and its
            engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region,' the bank
            said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and SEC are examining whether
            JPMorgan hired the children and other relatives of well-connected politicians and clients in hopes of
            steering business
            to the firm, possibly violating anti-bribery laws, a person with
            knowledge of the investigation said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The firm is cooperating with these investigations,' the
            New York-based bank said in the filing today. 'Separate
            inquiries on these or similar topics have been made by other
            authorities, including authorities in other jurisdictions, and
            the firm is responding to those inquiries.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
            Inc. (C), two of the three largest U.S. banks, said they're
            cooperating with various probes into the firms' foreign-exchange
            trading businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These investigations are in the early stages and the firm
            is cooperating with the relevant authorities,' New York-based
            JPMorgan said today in a quarterly filing with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. Citigroup, also based in New
            York, said in its 10-Q filing that it's responding to requests
            for information on probes by government agencies in the U.S. and
            other jurisdictions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators in London, Zurich, the U.S. and Asia are probing
            the foreign-exchange market after Bloomberg News reported in
            June that dealers in the industry said they had been front-running client orders, attempting to rig the
            benchmark
            WM/Reuters rates by colluding with counterparts and pushing
            through trades before and during the 60-second windows when the
            benchmarks are set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both JPMorgan and Citigroup put their top London currency

        <headline>JPMorgan Discloses Eight DOJ Probes From Asia to Madoff</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said that the
            U.S. Department of Justice is conducting at least eight separate
            investigations into the bank's activities, ranging from
            recruitment in Asia to its relationship with Ponzi scheme
            operator Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank disclosed for the first time in a
            filing yesterday that the Justice Department is examining its
            energy-trading practices, which were subject to a $410 million
            civil settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
            in July. Investigations are also focusing on mortgage-bond
            sales, interest-rate rigging, the credit-derivatives market, and
            the bank's trading loss last year, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said that it's a
            priority for his department and for President Barack Obama to
            hold banks accountable. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            visited Holder in September to try to negotiate a settlement of
            mortgage-related cases against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The scope and breadth of risky practices at JPMorgan are
            mind-boggling,' said Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve
            bank examiner who teaches risk management at Boston University.
            'Some of these probes are criminal, they're not even just civil
            anymore, and I think it's very telling about the broad risk-taking culture that was allowed under Jamie
            Dimon.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Currency Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The eight Justice Department investigations disclosed in
            JPMorgan's filing compare with one in Citigroup Inc.'s.
            Citigroup has disclosed two other investigations that weren't
            included in the latest filing because there was no material
            change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disclosures don't always specify whether the Justice
            Department is involved. For instance, both JPMorgan and
            Citigroup said they're cooperating with inquiries into the
            currency market without saying who's doing the investigating.
            The Justice Department is taking a leading role in the global
            probe into possible manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day
            foreign-exchange market, a department official said earlier this
            week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose $2.4 trillion in assets make it the biggest
            U.S. bank, last month reported its first quarterly loss under
            Dimon, 57, after taking a $7.2 billion after-tax charge to cover
            the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has tapped $8 billion of $28 billion in reserves
            set aside since 2010 to cover legal costs. JPMorgan said
            yesterday it may need as much as $5.7 billion more to cover
            'reasonably possible' losses in excess of the reserve, even
            after it added $9.2 billion in pretax cash to its litigation
            funds in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Wrong Message' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's purchase of Bear Stearns Cos. and some of
            Washington Mutual Inc.'s assets during the financial crisis have
            contributed to the bank's legal costs. American International
            Group Inc. CEO Robert Benmosche said the tough line taken
            against JPMorgan fails to account for the role that borrowers,
            regulators and government played in the crisis and may dissuade
            companies from making similar purchases in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'No good deed will go unpunished, and I think it's the
            wrong message to send, but the politicians want to punish
            someone here,' Benmosche, 69, said in an interview with Betty
            Liu on Bloomberg Television yesterday. 'We've got to stop the
            rhetoric about 'We've got to get the bad guys,' because I think
            most of us were the bad guys.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last week agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle
            claims from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that the bank
            misrepresented the quality of mortgage bonds it sold to Fannie
            Mae and Freddie Mac. That resolved part of a $13 billion
            settlement the company is seeking with state and federal
            authorities to close multiple investigations into its mortgage-securities sales practices. The U.S.
            Attorney's Office in
            Sacramento, California, is leading a criminal probe of the
            bank's mortgage business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorities in the U.S. and overseas are also looking at
            the bank's employment of people referred by clients, potential
            clients and government officials as well as hiring 'of certain
            former employees in Hong Kong, its business relationships with
            certain related clients in the Asia Pacific region and its
            engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region,'
            according to JPMorgan's filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, run by Preet Bharara, is examining whether JPMorgan
            violated criminal anti-bribery laws in hiring the children and other relatives of well-connected politicians
            and clients in hopes of steering business
            to the firm, a person with knowledge of the investigation said
            in August. JPMorgan said it was cooperating with the
            investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Madoff Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea, Singapore and India are among the locations
            where hiring practices are being scrutinized, the New York Times
            reported yesterday, citing unidentified people briefed on the
            matter. Investigators include authorities in the U.K., it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara's office is also is conducting an investigation
            into how JPMorgan handled Madoff's funds and whether it turned a
            blind eye to his multibillion-dollar fraud, the biggest Ponzi
            scheme in U.S. history. Bharara is weighing a deferred
            prosecution agreement or fine for JPMorgan in the Madoff probe,
            a person familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed yesterday that Bharara's office is
            examining whether the bank manipulated the electricity market.
            The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into JPMorgan's
            settlement with the FERC to see if any individuals committed any
            crimes, a person briefed on the matter said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The office is also conducting an investigation into
            JPMorgan's record trading loss last year by Bruno Iksil, who
            became known as the London whale because of the size of his
            trading bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Libor, CDS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan trader Julien Grout and his former boss,
            Javier Martin-Artajo, both of whom are in Europe and worked with
            Iksil, were indicted on securities fraud charges after being
            accused of trying to hide some of the more than $6.2 billion in
            losses in their unit last year. Grout and Martin-Artajo have
            denied wrongdoing, while Iksil is cooperating in the
            investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Additionally, JPMorgan is part of an industrywide
            investigation by the Justice Department and others looking at
            whether banks in the U.S. and abroad rigged benchmark interest
            rates tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The
            bank is cooperating with a probe of the credit-default swaps
            market that started in 2009, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said that it's also facing a civil investigation
            into its compliance with the Federal Housing Administration's
            direct endorsement program, which streamlines origination of
            federally insured home loans by banks and other lenders. &lt;/p&gt;

            reported a $2.3 billion withdrawal this week that spurred the
            biggest weekly outflow from U.S. investment-grade debt funds
            since June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund's net assets dropped 9.2 percent to $22.38 billion
            on Oct. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade funds reported a $2.67 billion outflow
            during the past
            week, with most of it coming from one fund, Bank of America
            Corp. (BAC) credit strategists Hans Mikkelsen and Yuriy Shchuchinov
            said in an Oct. 31 report, citing data from EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The withdrawal reported 'was likely a one-off event and no
            signal of a broader rotation out of high-grade bond funds,' the
            analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-grade bonds in the U.S. gained 1.5 percent in
            October as speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve will
            maintain its $85 billion of monthly asset purchases through
            March. Companies have sold $991.4 billion of the debt so far
            this year, on pace for the most ever, from $945.4 billion during
            the same period last year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Core Bond Fund (WOBDX) was started on Dec. 31, 1983,
            and focuses on investment-grade notes with medium-term
            maturities, according to the data. It had 25 percent of its
            assets in corporate bonds and 55.8 percent in mortgage debt as
            of Aug. 31, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Executive Dunleavy Named in FERC Complaint Retires</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Francis Dunleavy, the JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) energy executive who ran the Houston unit that developed
            trading strategies deemed illegal by the U.S. Federal Energy
            Regulatory Commission, has retired. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move, ending a career spanning more than three decades,
            took effect last month, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New
            York-based bank, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, as head of JPMorgan's principal investments unit,
            oversaw bidding strategies that the FERC said manipulated power
            markets. JPMorgan agreed in July to pay $410 million and forgo
            collecting on $262 million in disputed payments from
            California's grid operator to settle the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy was a Bear Stearns Cos. veteran, joining that firm
            in 1982 and becoming one of its senior energy executives,
            according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records.
            JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, acquired Bear Stearns
            in 2008. Andrew Kittell and John Bartholomew, who both reported
            to Dunleavy, still work for the bank, Marchiony said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the FERC didn't sanction individuals in the case, the
            Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a separate probe to see
            if anyone committed crimes, a person briefed on the matter said
            in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy resigned from JPMorgan warehouse operator Henry
            Bath Son Ltd., effective Oct. 25, according to a filing
            earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;William Scherman, an attorney for Dunleavy at Gibson Dunn
            Crutcher LLP in Washington, said his client wasn't available to
            comment. Reuters reported on Dunleavy's departure from JPMorgan
            earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads U.S. Banks Boosting Share of European Bond Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks increased their share of
            Europe's fixed-income market at the expense of local competitors
            as trading volumes slid in 2013, Greenwich Associates said in an
            annual survey report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) retained its position as the biggest
            secondary-market trader of European fixed-income products, with
            a 12.8 percent market share, down from 13.3 percent in 2012,
            Stamford, Connecticut-based Greenwich said on its website today.
            Second-placed Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)'s portion shrank to 10.5 percent
            from 11.9 percent, while JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) increased its
            share to 9.3 percent from 8.5 percent and Citigroup Inc. (C) had 7.7
            percent, up from about 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors reported reduced liquidity in bond markets in the
            second half of 2013, according to Greenwich, as speculation that
            the Federal Reserve would reduce the pace of its $85 billion of
            monthly asset purchases damped demand. UBS AG (UBSN) exited most fixed-income markets, while other European
            banks scaled back to comply
            with Basel III regulatory requirements, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It has become more difficult for many institutions to
            execute trades, and our data suggest that they are reaching out
            to new dealers in an attempt to source needed liquidity,' Peter D'Amario, a Greenwich Associate consultant,
            said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European banks are increasing the number of trading
            counterparties to gain access to liquidity, according to
            Greenwich. They averaged nine counterparties in this year's
            survey versus 8.4 in 2012. This increase benefited U.S banks and
            European institutions including UniCredit SpA (UCG), Commerzbank AG,
            Banca IMI SpA and Rabobank Groep, the Greenwich report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays, Britain's second-biggest lender by assets, was
            Greenwich's 2013 'Quality Leader' in European fixed-income
            trading, sales and overall service in rates products. JPMorgan
            was the 2013 'Quality Leader' in European fixed-income
            research and overall European service in credit products. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Weigh Chat-Room Ban Amid Regulatory Probes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is weighing whether to ban traders from using
            electronic chat rooms to communicate with peers at other firms as the forums draw scrutiny from global
            regulators, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's
            deliberations, which should be complete by early 2014, focus on multi-dealer chat rooms for currencies and
            other asset classes, said the person, who requested anonymity because the talks are private. Royal Bank of
            Scotland Group Plc, Britain's biggest publicly owned lender, and Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG,
            Switzerland's second-largest bank, also are reviewing chat-room use, two other people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulators
            have targeted traders' electronic messages, using them as evidence of wrongdoing in their investigations
            into the manipulation of benchmark interest rates and foreign-exchange markets. During a visit to London
            last month, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called on employees to be vigilant about language
            in e-mails and instant messages, two people with knowledge of the matter said then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            may encourage traders to use phones and e-mails rather than chat rooms to assist clients in large currency
            transactions, the person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Fourth-Quarter Trading Revenue Is Lower</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s fourth-quarter trading revenue will be slightly down from last year,
            according to Michael Cavanagh, who co-runs the bank's corporate
            and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Fixed income and equities are tracking very well versus
            client volumes, which are down slightly' from last year,
            Cavanagh said at an investor conference in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-banking fees for underwriting bond and equity
            issuance and advising on mergers and acquisitions are
            'healthy' this quarter and may be close to the previous three
            months, when JPMorgan generated $1.5 billion in fees, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Last year's fourth quarter was a particularly strong
            underwriting quarter. I don't think we'll achieve that again,
            but it's a healthy quarter,' Cavanagh said, adding that the
            final figure 'might come in looking something similar to the
            third quarter.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto run the corporate and investment
            bank, whose traders compiled a perfect record in the first nine
            months of this year by generating profits every day the markets
            were open. On three of those days, traders made more than $200
            million, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing this month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Settlement Truth in Advertising Sought on Taxes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;An aspect of U.S. tax law is being criticized by some lawmakers and consumer groups concerned that
            it may be worth billions of dollars for JPMorgan Chase Co in negotiations with the Department of Justice.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An agreement between the government and the bank over mortgage-bond sales that's silent
            on taxes would let the company take a deduction and shave 35 percent off any settlement cost publicized in
            headlines. That would, for example, turn an announced settlement of $10 billion into one for $6.5 billion.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It shouldn't have hidden subsidies or sweeteners in the settlement,' said Francisco
            Enriquez, a tax and budget associate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which says it operates as a
            counter to big banks. 'If the DOJ is in the end going to look for a $6.5 billion price tag, then that's what
            they should say.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax implications are a complicated part of settlement talks between
            companies and the U.S. government. Companies focused on after-tax costs negotiate with government agencies
            that may be more concerned about how big a payment they can claim to have extracted than about how much
            money ends up in the Treasury. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'At dinner parties, a billion sounds better than $700
            million, even if a billion is tax deductible and $700 million is not,' said Gregg Polsky, a law professor at
            the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied the taxation of penalties and damage
            payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, a DOJ spokesman, declined to comment because the talks are
            continuing on resolving multiple legal issues surrounding the mortgage-bond sales. Also declining to comment
            was Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fines, Restitution &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. tax law places payments to government agencies into two categories: fines and penalties, which
            are not deductible, and compensatory damages and restitution, which can be deducted as business expenses.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a settlement agreement is silent on taxes, a company is free to claim a deduction
            against the 35 percent federal corporate income tax and state income taxes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Internal
            Revenue Service may challenge the deduction, a path that can lead to litigation over whether payments were
            deductible restitution or non-deductible penalties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some government settlement accords
            include clauses where companies agree not to take deductions. For example, the agreement this month between
            the Justice Department and SAC Capital Advisors LP prevented the hedge fund from deducting any of the $1.8
            billion payment in that settlement and a related case with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $5.1 billion settlement on Oct. 25 with the Federal Housing Finance Agency included no
            clause limiting tax deductions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Pretty Clear' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Absent such an
            agreement, I think it's pretty clear that virtually all of the payment will be deductible,' said Robert
            Willens, a New York-based tax and accounting consultant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers including
            Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, want the bank to forgo a tax deduction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It
            was the taxpayer who initially funded the bailout of Wall Street,' Welch wrote on Oct. 30 to Jamie Dimon,
            the bank's chairman and chief executive officer. 'It was the taxpayer who continues to endure the
            consequences of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The taxpayer should not, therefore, be
            required to contribute a nickel towards the fines imposed for conduct that got America into this mess in the
            first place.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grassley, Reed &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa
            Republican, and Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, introduced legislation this month that would
            require the government and companies to reach advance agreements on how settlements will be taxed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 2007 version of the measure was estimated to generate $263 million in government revenue over 10
            years, according to Jill Gerber, a spokeswoman for Grassley. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cases with punitive and
            compensatory components are complicated by the differing goals of those involved in the negotiations, Polsky
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The defendant cares about the after-tax dollars,' he said. 'The IRS cares about
            the after-tax dollars. The regulatory agency that's settling the case, they don't seem to care about the
            after-tax' amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enriquez said settlement deductibility is a systemic issue that
            amounts to a loophole, letting companies deduct payments that are really being made to avoid formal fines.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Quite Angry' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Wrongdoing should not constitute a tax writeoff and
            wrongdoing shouldn't be subsidized by the American people,' he said. 'People are just generally quite angry
            and rightfully so that JPMorgan could get a massive $3.5 billion tax deduction for their suffering.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Willens said lawmakers have become more aware of the deductibility of settlements, making it
            possible that the JPMorgan agreement could include clauses on taxes to make the real cost more closely match
            the announced amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Given the outrage that has been expressed by some about the
            ability to deduct this, including some pretty influential politicians, I would think there probably would be
            something in the agreement,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Reed-Grassley bill is S. 1654. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Hilton Commercial Mortgage Bonds Said to Be Marketed by JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks led by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            are marketing $3.5 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds tied to
            Hilton Worldwide Inc. as Blackstone Group LP prepares to take
            the hotelier public, people with knowledge of the offering said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest such transaction since the credit crisis is
            linked to 23 properties across the U.S., said the people, who
            asked not to be identified because terms aren't public. JPMorgan
            is working with Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp., Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to arrange the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hilton deal comes with sales of securities linked to
            commercial real estate loans poised to surpass $70 billion in
            2013, more than double the volume in 2012, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The commercial-mortgage securities are
            enabling Blackstone (BX), the world's largest private-equity firm, to
            pay down a portion $13.4 billion in debt refinanced in October,
            deal documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2007 takeover of Hilton for $26 billion was the largest
            ever for a hotel company, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone restructured the debt in April 2010, reducing
            its debt load by $4 billion and pushing back maturities to 2015,
            as consumers and businesses cut back on travel amid the economic
            downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seven months later, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs
            sought to sell about $3 billion of the restructured debt in a
            commercial-mortgage bond deal. The transaction was cut in half
            when investors demanded additional yield to buy the securities,
            prompting Goldman to pull its portion of the sale, people with
            knowledge of the deal said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Real estate investors are cashing in on hotels as values
            climb along with occupancy and room rates. Prices for
            hospitality properties in non-major markets, which excludes the
            largest U.S. cities such as New York, have climbed 28.3 percent
            over the last 12 months, according to Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Global regulators this week put
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) at the pinnacle of a
            list of 29 too-big-to-fail banks that face tougher capital rules
            than other lenders. The companies were also handed a map to plot
            their descent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For the first time since it started compiling a roster of
            lenders whose collapse would threaten the global economy, the
            Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also disclosed the
            thresholds for how it determined the level of extra capital
            requirements that such banks should face. The move will enable
            lenders to find ways to move down to a lower surcharge category
            or exit the list altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The capital surcharges for globally systemic lenders add an
            extra layer of safety beyond beefed-up standards known as Basel
            III that emerged in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman
            Brothers Holdings Inc. Regulators said the additional buffers
            were vital to protect taxpayers and prevent crises from
            cascading through the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think the Basel committee would be quite happy in this
            instance for banks to change their scores by becoming smaller,
            less interconnected, less complex,' said Patricia Jackson, head
            of prudential advisory at Ernst Young LLP in London. 'It's
            also a shot across the bows in the sense that if they become
            more complex, larger, relative to others they go up the list.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's #AskJPM Twitter Hashtag Backfires Against Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the target of at least eight Justice Department investigations, was mocked and
            taunted by Twitter users after asking followers to send questions to an executive using the hashtag #AskJPM.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The online forum, which the bank canceled late yesterday, was intended in part to give
            college students an opportunity to communicate directly with a senior executive, said Brian Marchiony, a
            spokesman for the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'#Badidea! Back to the drawing board,' the
            bank posted less than six hours after its original post, which drew more than 6,000 responses from users in
            that span, according to social media tracking service Topsy. The #AskJPM hashtag had more than 24,000 posts
            on Twitter as of 10 a.m. New York time, according to Topsy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If you're in the banking
            industry with what's happened over the last five years, it might not be a good idea to go out and solicit
            comments on social media,' said Brad Adgate, a senior vice president at marketing firm Horizon Media Inc. in
            New York. 'They are paying all these fines and billions of dollars to the federal government. I question the
            timing of this.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 'Snarkpocalypse,' as @ReformedBroker dubbed it, started after the
            company's official Twitter account posted a call for questions at 1:26 p.m. in New York yesterday for
            investment bank Vice Chairman James Lee, using #AskJPM. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining
            JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) ties to a consulting firm owned by the
            daughter of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao as part of a probe
            into whether the bank awarded contracts and jobs in order to win
            business deals, the New York Times reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is cooperating with the Securities and Exchange
            Commission and the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which are
            leading the investigation, and also conducting its own internal
            review, the newspaper reported. The bank hasn't been accused of
            any wrongdoing, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Agree to Cover WaMu Costs on Mortgage Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to drop
            litigation against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over some
            mortgage bonds sold by Washington Mutual Inc., clearing the way
            for a $9 billion accord with state and federal officials, two
            people briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement will be announced tomorrow, said one of the
            people, requesting anonymity because the negotiations aren't
            public. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, agreed
            today to the terms of $4 billion in consumer relief payments,
            the person said. The remaining $5 billion will go toward
            penalties and resolving claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank battled with the FDIC over who should pay some
            liabilities from WaMu, the failed Seattle thrift that the agency
            placed into receivership in 2008 while selling assets to New
            York-based JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement, which is being brokered by the Justice
            Department, won't interfere with JPMorgan's ability to sue the
            FDIC to cover part of a $4 billion settlement last month with
            the Federal Housing Finance Agency, two people familiar with the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It also won't prohibit the bank from seeking reimbursement
            from the FDIC for claims against WaMu from private investors,
            they said. JPMorgan announced a tentative $4.5 billion deal last
            week with 21 institutional investors, including Pacific
            Investment Management Co., to settle claims that the lender and
            its subsidiaries sold faulty mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Attorneys General &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $9 billion settlement, which includes a $2 billion
            fine, will end civil investigations by the Justice Department
            and the California and New York state attorneys general, as well
            as lawsuits by the FDIC and National Credit Union
            Administration, people briefed on the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrew Gray, a spokesman for the FDIC, JPMorgan's Brian Marchiony and Brian Fallon at the Justice
            Department said they
            couldn't comment because the negotiations are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consumer-relief portion of the accord, negotiated over
            the weekend by Associate Attorney General Tony West and U.S.
            Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, requires
            JPMorgan to hire an independent monitor and provide the entire
            $4 billion by the end of 2016, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's costs include at least $1.5 billion in principal
            writedowns for struggling homeowners with federally backed
            loans, the person said. Of that, $1.2 billion would be for first
            lien principal writedowns. At least $300 million must go toward
            forbearance, in which banks shift loan terms to account for a
            change in a debtor's income, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vacant Homes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An additional $2 billion would fund interest-rate
            reductions of existing loans, new loans or loan originations
            that JPMorgan would be required to keep in its portfolio, the
            person said. The bank also would receive credit for so-called
            anti-blight efforts, such as the costs of demolishing vacant
            homes and absorbing the mortgages of such properties the bank
            has yet to foreclose on, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan doesn't provide the entire $4 billion by the
            end of 2016 then the bank would be required to pay any leftover
            portion to the government or a nonprofit, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. ended plans to manage China Everbright Bank Co.'s Hong Kong share sale amid a
            U.S. investigation into the Wall Street firm's hiring practices in China, two people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank told Everbright it would quit the deal, which at $2 billion
            would be the largest first-time offering by a Chinese lender in Hong Kong since 2009, because the probe
            delayed an internal approval process, the people said. They asked not to be identified because the matter is
            confidential. Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S.
            authorities are examining whether New York-based JPMorgan violated anti-bribery laws by hiring the children
            and other relatives of well-connected politicians and clients in China so that their family members would
            steer business to the firm, a person with knowledge of the investigation said in August. JPMorgan said it
            was cooperating with the probes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May
            requested records from JPMorgan concerning Tang Xiaoning, the son of China Everbright Group Chairman Tang
            Shuangning, the New York Times reported in August, citing a confidential government document. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will pay a record $13 billion to resolve U.S. Justice Department probes
            into the bank's sale of mortgage bonds that officials said helped feed the financial chaos of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord settles allegations that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, misled investors
            and the public when it sold bonds backed by faulty residential mortgages, according to Justice Department
            statement today. U.S. and state officials blamed the bank's actions in the statement for helping to cause
            the credit crisis, and said the settlement doesn't shield JPMorgan or its employees from criminal charges.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Without a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of
            the mortgage meltdown,' Attorney General Eric Holder said in the statement. 'JPMorgan was not the only
            financial institution during this period to knowingly bundle toxic loans and sell them to unsuspecting
            investors, but that is no excuse for the firm's behavior.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief
            executive officer, said in a separate statement that the settlement resolves a significant portion of claims
            tied to mortgage-backed securities issued by the lender and two firms it bought during the credit crisis,
            Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.'s bank unit. The sum is covered by reserves, and JPMorgan is
            cooperating with the Justice Department's criminal case, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Henry Bath Son Ltd., the
            commodities warehouse unit of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) that it wants
            to sell, reported profit of $2.4 million last year as revenue
            jumped 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Profit dropped from $27.7 million a year earlier due to tax
            changes, Liverpool, England-based Henry Bath said in a filing
            with the U.K.'s Companies House. Before taxes, profit rose to
            $42.57 million from $34.19 million. Revenue rose to $148.96
            million from $120.28 million. The company provides storage for
            cocoa, coffee and metal stockpiles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Stock holdings have continued to grow through 2012,
            resulting in a positive impact on the group profits,' Henry
            Bath said in the filing. It had net assets of $311.9 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said in July that it plans
            to get out of the business of owning and trading physical
            commodities. The firm could sell or spin off holdings that
            include Henry Bath, as well as stakes in power plants and
            traders in materials such as gas and coal. The New York-based
            firm has sought $3.3 billion for the division, a person with
            direct knowledge of the sale process said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., which is planning to break off its buyout unit, is in talks to sell about $4
            billion of private-equity stakes to an investor group, said three people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The potential buyers examining the holdings include Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Coller
            Capital Ltd., Lexington Partners, HarbourVest Partners LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Ardian, said two of
            the people. They asked not to be named because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investor group
            would also provide capital for new deals to One Equity Partners, the private-equity arm of JPMorgan that's
            in the process of becoming an independent firm. The business, which used to invest the bank's own money,
            will begin raising its next fund from an external group of investors, the bank said in June. JPMorgan joins
            banks including Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. in cutting back private-equity holdings to focus
            on its main businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment, as
            did officials for the investment firms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. lender, agreed
            in September to sell its emerging-markets private-equity unit to the Rohatyn Group to comply with new curbs
            on bank investments. Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-biggest bank, in February struck a deal to sell its
            stake in the first fund of Global Infrastructure Partners to Lexington Partners Inc., according to a person
            with knowledge of the matter. The bank in August agreed to sell its private-equity, infrastructure and real
            estate investment business to Grosvenor Capital Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;

            a property fund with JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) real estate analyst
            Harm Meijer, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Information about the fund and what it will invest in will
            be announced early next year, said the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the matter isn't yet public. The fund may
            have a third founding partner, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Poitrinal, 45, ran Unibail-Rodamco, the largest European
            real estate investment trust, from 2005 until he stepped down in
            April. The Paris-based company operates malls in 12 countries.
            Poitrinal didn't respond to a text message requesting comment
            and his phone was busy. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan $13 Billion Mortgage Deal Seen as Lawsuit Shield</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s record $13
            billion deal to end probes into mortgage-bond sales may save the
            bank billions more because of what the agreement lacked: an
            explicit admission of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Employees of JPMorgan and two firms it acquired knew some
            of the loans included in bonds didn't meet underwriting
            standards, a fact not shared with buyers of those securities,
            the U.S. Justice Department said yesterday in a statement. That
            doesn't mean the company misled investors, said Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake, disputing how some state and federal
            officials characterized the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, sought to end one of the
            largest legal uncertainties it faced without providing fodder to
            private litigants. The firm is still the subject of Justice
            Department probes into its energy-trading business, recruiting
            practices in Asia and its relationship with Ponzi scheme
            operator Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've left themselves some wiggle room to say, 'No we
            didn't violate the law',' said Peter Henning, a former federal
            prosecutor and Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who
            teaches law at Wayne State University in Detroit. 'There is at
            least some acknowledgment that there were improprieties, but
            exactly what they were remains open, and certainly they can deny
            it in any specific case.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Deal Offers Turning Point for Eric Holder</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department's $13 billion
            mortgage securities settlement with JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is a
            record and also a rarity -- Attorney General Eric Holder's first
            big win against a bank at the heart of 2008's financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Holder, the part of the deal announced this week that
            requires the bank to pay $9 billion to resolve allegations it
            knowingly sold bad mortgage securities is a potential turning
            point after a tenure studded with controversy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several more announcements are on the way to bring
            financial institutions to account, Holder has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have to wait until we are finished with all the work
            that we will do,' Holder said in an interview. 'When we get to
            that point you will see that we have taken the mandate that we
            were given seriously, that we held people accountable, that we
            held institutions accountable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan deal has its critics. Some say it's too tough
            on the bank after the government called it in to take over Bear
            Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Bank when they failed. Others
            say Holder hasn't gone far enough, because he hasn't brought
            criminal charges against bankers. Several lawmakers and others
            have faulted the deal for leaving open the possibility that the
            bank could write off a portion of the penalties, essentially
            passing some of the burden to taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>The JPMorgan Settlement Isn't Justice</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;For years the public has vented about half-baked government settlements in which corporations and
            white-collar defendants 'neither admit nor deny' the allegations against them. The Justice Department wasn't
            about to go down that path when it unveiled its big, not-really-$13 billion deal this week with JPMorgan
            Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the government made a few sly tweaks. The result is a mutant offspring of
            the no-admit genre that may be even less satisfying than the parent. JPMorgan didn't have to admit to any
            violations of the law. And here's the rub: The Justice Department didn't allege any, either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According
            to the settlement agreement, the bank will pay a civil penalty 'pursuant to' a statute called the Financial
            Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. However, the Justice Department didn't lodge any claims
            against JPMorgan for breaking that law or any other. This was an out-of-court settlement. The Justice
            Department didn't file a complaint. No judge's approval was needed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement did
            incorporate an 11-page statement of facts that explained in vague terms what JPMorgan did. Yet none of the
            acknowledgments by JPMorgan in that document hurt the bank. JPMorgan didn't admit liability or even any
            mistakes. That's no better than the old 'neither admit nor deny' boilerplate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No
            Justice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn't justice. It's more like the greenmail that companies sometimes pay
            to corporate raiders who demand premium prices for their shares in exchange for going away. No individuals
            got pinched. We don't know much about the details of what the Justice Department's investigation found. It's
            unclear why prosecutors didn't accuse JPMorgan of fraud, although one possible explanation is that the
            government lacks proof. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The wording of the settlement agreement was awkward at times,
            too. It said the Justice Department had investigated the mortgage-bond operations of JPMorgan and two
            failing companies that it bought: Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. 'Based on those
            investigations, the United States believes that there is an evidentiary basis to compromise potential legal
            claims by the United States against JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, for violation of federal
            laws,' the agreement said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That line makes it seem like the U.S. doubted its own case,
            although perhaps it was just poorly drafted. The sentence would have made more sense if it said there was
            enough evidence to 'bring' claims against JPMorgan, not 'compromise' them. Maybe the prosecutors were trying
            to say they believed there was sufficient evidence to merit a settlement. But that doesn't make much sense,
            either: The act of settling speaks for itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an aside, it's fitting that
            Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley took part in the same accord. Of the $13 billion headline
            figure -- which combined the Justice Department's $2 billion penalty with the amounts secured by several
            state and federal agencies -- the settlement agreement earmarked about $34 million for Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2009, Coakley took a similar claim-free approach to squeeze money from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            Her office didn't file a lawsuit or allege that Goldman Sachs violated any statutes or rules. Goldman Sachs
            didn't admit anything, either. But it did pay $60 million to make the Massachusetts investigation go away.
            Coakley's office had been looking into Goldman Sachs's packaging of subprime mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surely
            some of the money that JPMorgan shells out will go to good use. Yet something important is lost when
            law-enforcement officials strike bargains with powerful corporations behind closed doors and fail to be
            transparent about what their investigations uncovered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said this
            week that the settlement 'does not absolve JPMorgan or its employees from facing any possible criminal
            charges.' By this point, though, it's hard to take the Justice Department seriously when it says to stay
            tuned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not Really &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The department also said that 'JPMorgan
            acknowledged it made serious misrepresentations to the public' as part of the agreed-upon statement of
            facts. Actually, it did no such thing. The document didn't use the word 'misrepresentation' or similar
            language to describe any of JPMorgan's actions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually when corporations settle with
            the Justice Department, they agree not to contradict the government's assertions publicly. Yet on this
            occasion JPMorgan felt compelled to set the record straight. 'We didn't say that we acknowledge serious
            misrepresentation of the facts,' JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said during a Nov. 19
            conference call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was right: The Justice Department overreached in its
            characterization. It isn't a good sign when the company paying billions of dollars to resolve a government
            probe comes across as more believable than the government lawyers who cut the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Jonathan

        <headline>BlackRock Says JPMorgan Deal Undermining U.S. Market: Mortgages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) record $13
            billion deal to end mortgage bond probes has terms that
            undermine U.S. efforts to reduce taxpayer support of the market,
            according to BlackRock Inc., the world's biggest money manager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Washington has a public policy goal of reducing the role
            that the government plays in the housing-finance market, and at
            the same time we now have a series of settlements where no
            investors were at the table and where money toward the
            settlements may come from investors' pockets,' said Barbara Novick, vice chairman of BlackRock. 'It
            discourages the
            allocation of private capital to mortgage credit.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan struck the agreement this week to settle potential
            state and federal civil claims of misrepresentations in
            mortgage-bond sales by the lender and companies it acquired. The
            largest U.S. bank can earn credit toward meeting $4 billion of
            consumer relief required by the deal through reworking mortgages
            owned by investors in the securities, potentially harming
            holders, according to Novick. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock (BLK), which oversees $4.1 trillion, and other buyers
            of mortgage bonds without government backing have criticized
            multiple federal and local actions in the wake of the U.S.
            housing crash as unfair to investors, saying they deter
            participation in the $9.3 trillion home-mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Best Interest' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With taxpayer-backed programs financing about 85 percent of
            new home loans, issuance of non-agency bonds is about 1 percent
            of the record level reached in 2005 and 2006. Sales of
            commercial-mortgage securities have recovered to 34 percent of a
            pre-crisis peak and loans to junk-rated companies are on pace to
            exceed $1 trillion this year, more than during the boom years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Loan modifications will be done only if they are in the
            best interest of the investor and in accordance with the bank's
            agreements with the investors,' said Adora Andy Jenkins,
            Justice Department spokeswoman. 'So when these modifications
            are made, it's because they're good for investors, consumers and
            neighborhoods across the country that are still recovering from
            the financial crisis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock's Novick said, 'that's hard for us as investors
            to measure: We don't get enough transparency into what's going
            on.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, JPMorgan will receive partial credit
            for steps it takes on loans serviced for others, according to a
            settlement document on the Justice Department's website. For
            instance, the bank typically will get a 50 cent credit for each
            dollar of principal reductions for homeowners whose debt it
            doesn't own. The bank gets 100 percent for loans it owns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lobbying Justice &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Association of Mortgage Investors was among groups that
            lobbied the Justice Department to preclude the bank from getting
            credit for loans owned by investors to help fulfill its
            obligations, as occurred with 2012 agreements over foreclosure
            practices involving JPMorgan and four other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 32 percent of credit granted to JPMorgan under the
            earlier deal was tied to loans the bank serviced and didn't
            hold, according to a court filing last month by the monitor for
            the settlement, which was sparked by allegations of 'robo-signing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Graham Fisher Co. analyst Joshua Rosner said that
            allowing any consumer aid that may harm bondholders to be part
            of the latest deal makes little sense. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Investors Misled' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These were claims about investments where investors were
            misled,' Rosner said in a Nov. 19 interview on Bloomberg
            Television. 'Why is money going to consumers?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Homeowners also were harmed by shoddy securitization
            practices, according to a government official involved in the
            settlement. Giving JPMorgan credit for loans held within bonds
            will help more of the neediest get aid because many of the worst
            mortgages were packaged into securities, said the official, who
            asked not to be named because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, Democrat and Republican lawmakers
            and regulators including the Treasury Department and Federal
            Housing Finance Agency have all said they want more private
            capital in the home-loan market five years after the government
            rescued Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond investors are still wary of the market after
            record losses from the worst housing crash since the Great
            Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Bears Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.
            home loans from 2005 through 2008 placed into non-agency bonds
            have experienced more than $76 billion of losses, and $30
            billion of the remaining debt is at least 60 days delinquent,
            according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Promised Quality &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors, insurers and regulators have said in lawsuits
            against JPMorgan that reviews of soured loans showed in some
            cases that more than 80 percent failed to match their promised
            quality. The bank bought Washington Mutual's banking assets and
            Bear Stearns in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock, which is JPMorgan's biggest shareholder, and
            other investors have also opposed efforts by local governments
            to use their eminent domain powers to seize and rework mortgages
            held within bonds. The asset manager, which joined in August
            with competitors to seek a court order to block Richmond,
            California's efforts to advance such a plan, contends it will
            depress private lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Municipalities in about 11 states from California and
            Washington to Ohio, New York, New Jersey are still at least
            looking into the idea, according toRobert Hockett, a Cornell
            University professor who's advised the local governments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The servicer settlement and the eminent domain proposals
            all discourage private capital,' Novick said in a telephone
            interview. 'If you don't know what your rights are as an
            investor, why would you allocate capital?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investors' Ire &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors' ire has built since a 2008 settlement between
            Bank of America Corp.'s Countrywide Financial unit and state
            attorneys general in which claims of predatory lending yielded a
            deal that called for mostly investor-owned loans to be revised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since then, state and federal governments have taken a
            series of steps to temporarily freeze or slow foreclosures.
            Congress passed a law protecting servicers from certain investor
            suits and the federal Home Affordable Modification Program was
            structured in a way that aids banks, mortgage investors have
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In JPMorgan's latest deal, the bank can get credit for
            extinguishing second mortgages a day before a foreclosure in
            which the debt will be wiped out, saidLaurie Goodman, director
            of Urban Institute's housing finance policy center. The bank
            gets 40 percent credit for non-performing second loans, up from
            as little as 10 percent in the earlier deal in which observers
            questioned the credit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Principal Forgiveness &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a role for giving credit for principal
            forgiveness on second liens but the 40 cents on the dollar seems
            miscalibrated,' said Goodman, a former mortgage-bond analyst at
            firms including UBS AG and Amherst Securities Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit is also available for refinancing Fannie Mae (FNMA) and
            Freddie Mac mortgages serviced by others under the federal Home
            Affordable Refinance Program, which JPMorgan 'might be doing
            anyway,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's costs from the consumer relief are already
            accounted for in its provisions, Chief Financial Officer
            Marianne Lakesaid on a Nov. 19 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Giving JPMorgan partial credit on investor-owned loans
            hurts rather than helps bondholders because it means the lender
            has to write down more mortgages to get the same amount, said
            Chris Ames, a senior portfolio manager at Schroder Investment
            Management North America Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Judgment Call &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The decision by a servicer to write off debt is a
            judgment call,' Ames said in an e-mail. The type of settlement
            creates 'perverse incentives, and the servicing of private
            label securities isn't transparent enough for investors to
            evaluate the decision-making.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The perceived harm to bondholders would be even less likely
            if a separate agreement reached last week between JPMorgan and
            21 institutional investors including BlackRock is finalized,
            according to the government official. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under that proposed settlement of mortgage-bond holders'
            own claims of misrepresentations, JPMorgan would allow servicing
            on certain loans to be transferred along with paying $4.5
            billion. The agreement doesn't cover Washington Mutual debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trustees representing all investors in the deals have as
            many as 120 days to accept the proposal. Certain investors may
            seek to resist the accord, according to Nomura Securities
            International analysts Paul Nikodem andPratik Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nomura Estimate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 7 percent payout relative to past and projected losses
            on the loans is lower than the about 10 percent seen in a $8.5
            billion proposed deal reached in 2011 by Bank of America still
            being fought over in court, according to Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novick declined to comment on that settlement, whileKathy Patrick, a partner at Gibbs Bruns LLP
            representing the
            investor group, didn't return an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Novick said BlackRock isn't opposed to borrowers
            getting their balances lowered, the firm 'stands by' its view
            that the step should mainly occur under a mediation process in
            which borrowers' unsecured debt such as credit-card borrowing
            and second mortgages are extinguished first. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're in favor of the rule of law, and the forgiveness of
            debt in the order it should be under contract law,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Prosecutors Said to Seek JPMorgan Indictment on Paschi</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Siena prosecutors requested that JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) stand trial for obstructing regulators as
            part of a wider probe into Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA's purchase of Banca Antonveneta SpA,
            according to four people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege JPMorgan
            withheld information from regulators about a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) financing the New York-based bank
            arranged for Monte Paschi's takeover of Antonveneta in 2008, said the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the request is not public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan failed to oversee employees properly,
            according to the indictment request, the people said. A judge will review the request at a date that's to be
            determined. Prosecutors also are seeking indictments against former Monte Paschi managers for obstructing
            regulators, as well as market manipulation and falsifying filings, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            should have informed the Bank of Italy that Monte Paschi had guaranteed it against losing money on the bond
            sale, the central bank said in an April 19 letter to prosecutors. The Bank of Italy said it may have
            withheld approval for the deal had it known about the indemnity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'No claim was ever made
            under the indemnity, which only existed for a matter of days, including either for the benefit of JPMorgan
            or any of its employees,' the U.S. bank said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. 'We believe that JPMorgan
            and its employees acted correctly at all times. We will defend this action vigorously.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Unprecedented
            Effort' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monte Paschi bought Antonveneta from Banco Santander SA (SAN) in 2008 for 9
            billion euros, 36 percent more than the Spanish lender paid for the Padua, Italy-based bank two months
            earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, told employees on Sept. 17 to
            prepare for more legal woes while the bank undertakes an 'unprecedented effort' to comply with regulations.
            In the U.S., the lender is in talks to pay about $11 billion by state and federal authorities to end
            investigations into its mortgage-bond sales practices, a person familiar with the discussions said last
            week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Investment Bank Revenues to Fall 18% in Quarter, JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue at the world's biggest
            investment banks may be down 18 percent in the third quarter
            after a drop in their fixed-income, currencies and commodities
            divisions, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter FICC revenue may decline 24 percent from the
            previous quarter and by 35 percent from the same period last
            year, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote to clients today,
            citing lower trading volume and tighter credit spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equities sales are expected to fall by 13 percent from the
            prior quarter because of low volatility and weak volume in
            equity derivatives. Advisory and underwriting revenue may slip
            by 14 percent, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global investment banks tracked by JPMorgan are Credit
            Suisse Group AG (CSGN), UBS (UBSN) AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc., Morgan Stanley (MS), Barclays Plc (BARC), Societe Generale SA and BNP
            Paribas SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan recommends UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank,
            because of its business mix and Deutsche Bank, which is the
            cheapest among its peers based on price to earnings and price to
            net asset value, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fed Must Give Better Guidance to Market, JPMorgan's Frenkel Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve should give more
            subtle guidance to financial markets rather than pin its policy
            decisions on unpredictable targets, which can send confusing
            signals if these fail to materialize as anticipated, said Jacob Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase
            International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markets would benefit from a 'guidance of economic
            realities,' the former governor of the Bank of Israel said at
            the Global Economic Symposium in Kiel, Germany today. 'But you
            have to be very subtle when you go about it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank should also avoid giving dates for
            policy changes such as an end to its bond buying or a change in
            interest rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in June he expected the
            bank would complete its bond buying when the jobless level was
            around 7 percent, linking a policy decision to specific
            unemployment rates. Policy makers have pledged since December
            that they won't consider raising interest rates as long as
            unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After a decline in August to 7.3 percent for an unexpected
            reason -- Americans giving up on finding work -- the Federal
            Open Market Committee's Sept. 18 decided not to taper its $85
            billion in monthly bond buying, bucking economist predictions
            that it would scale back the purchases that have bolstered
            credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would be very nice to have a guidance of economic
            realities,' Frenkel said. Unemployment is not the right measure
            for guidance as 'U.S. unemployment declined much more
            rapidly than expected by anyone but growth is not generated by
            that as labor force participation shrank.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Confuse Matters &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For a long time the monetary authority decided not to
            discuss exits, as they did not want to confuse matters, but
            let's face it, if you go into a highway, wouldn't you like to
            know before you enter if it is a dead-end or it has an exit,'
            he said at a panel about the future of central banking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central banks must also be freed from the burden of
            'worrisome concerns about financial market stability,' he
            said. To rebalance the situation, the financial industry needs
            to increase banks' capital levels, while lowering their
            leverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Thirdly, liquidity must be higher than it used to be as
            much of the crisis arises when we have a lack of liquidity,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names McNamer to Oversee Expanded Charitable Giving</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, appointed nonprofit executive Bruce McNamer to run
            its global philanthropic initiatives as the company expands
            charitable giving. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McNamer will oversee all of JPMorgan's donations in newly
            created roles as chief executive officer of the JPMorgan Chase
            Foundation and the corporation's head of global philanthropy,
            the company said in a statement today. He's spent the last nine
            years running TechnoServe, a charitable group that helps build
            farms, businesses and industries in developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The private sector needs to step up and do its part to
            address the critical challenges we face,' JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dalila Wilson-Scott, who has run the foundation since the
            beginning of the year, will succeed Kimberly Davis as the
            permanent president of the foundation, the company said. Wilson-Scott came from the corporate merger office
            and served in
            strategic planning'in the'consumer and commercial banking
            businesses, according to the New York-based lender. McNamer and
            Wilson-Scott will report to Peter Scher, who oversees corporate
            responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Davis left in November, according to a person with direct
            knowledge of the matter who wasn't authorized to comment
            publicly on the departure. She's listed as a managing director
            on the website of Teneo Holdings, a New York consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Chase Foundation announced a partnership last
            week with the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation to finance
            technologies that fight killer diseases in low-income countries.
            Gates founded Microsoft Corp., the software firm. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Commodities Sale to Mercuria Said to Shrink</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.'s six-month-old agreement to buy JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s physical
            commodities business for $3.5 billion was revised to cover only
            $800 million of assets, according to people familiar with the
            change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to sell the rest of the business in separate
            transactions, said the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the final deal's terms haven't been made public. Some
            separate sales have already been agreed, one person said. The
            Wall Street Journal reported on the changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading houses such as Mercuria are filling the void as
            banks from JPMorgan and Barclays Plc to Deutsche Bank AG and
            Morgan Stanley (MS) withdraw from or scale back physical commodity
            operations amid increased regulatory scrutiny of lenders owning,
            storing and trading raw materials. Founded in 2004 by former
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi,
            Mercuria has grown to become the world's fourth-largest
            independent commodity trader with 2013 revenue of $112 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the assets not being purchased by Mercuria include a
            crude oil supply agreement to a refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota,
            the refinery's owner, Northern Tier Energy LP, said in a
            regulatory filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's physical commodity business, formerly led by
            Blythe Masters, has previously generated annual operating profit
            before compensation costs of $750 million, according to people
            who have seen documents related to the unit's sale. That would
            bring Mercuria, which posted net income of $273 million last
            year, closer to earnings achieved by competitors Vitol Group and
            Trafigura Beheer BV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria competed with Macquarie Group Ltd. and Blackstone
            Group LP to enter exclusive negotiations for the unit in
            February, people with knowledge of the bidding said at the time.
            The JPMorgan unit, put up for sale last year, was slated to give
            Mercuria gas and power trading operations on both sides of the
            Atlantic, physical assets spanning about 40 locations in North
            America and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian
            oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria also gets Henry Bath Sons Ltd., a 220-year-old
            metal-warehouse operator based in Liverpool, England, that will
            be operated as a stand-alone subsidiary separated from
            Mercuria's trading operations. Henry Bath was a founding member
            of the London Metal Exchange, and handles products that include
            aluminum, steel and copper as well as cocoa and coffee,
            according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria, which is registered in Cyprus and has its main
            trading operations in Geneva, offered jobs to about 200 people,
            or about half of the unit's staff, a person familiar with the
            matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Here's What You Need to Know About JPMorgan's Data Breach</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, today described the size of its previously disclosed
            data breach, ranking it among the year's largest-known cyber-attacks. Here's what customers need to know:
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. How big was the breach? A. JPMorgan estimated that data on 76 million households and
            7 million small businesses were compromised, without identifying locations. For perspective, the U.S. had
            about 115 million households total as of 2012. The breach affected people who visited the firm's websites,
            including Chase.com, or used its mobile app, said a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q.
            What information was taken? A. User contact information including names, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail
            addresses. Internal data identifying customers by category -- such as whether they're clients of the
            mortgage, auto, credit-card or private-bank divisions -- also were exposed, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic:
            Top U.S. Data Breaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. What wasn't taken? A. JPMorgan said there's no evidence hackers
            stole account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q.
            Are hackers draining accounts, and is my money safe? A. JPMorgan said it hasn't seen any unusual fraud
            linked to the breach. Customers aren't liable for unauthorized transactions if the bank is promptly alerted,
            the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internet Security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. What should I do to protect
            myself? A. Because account IDs and passwords weren't compromised, JPMorgan said it isn't necessary to obtain
            new credit or debit cards, change passwords or obtain identity or credit monitoring as a result of the
            incident. The firm said customers should alert it immediately if they spot suspicious transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Q. What can hackers do with contact information? A. Phishing scams are typically the biggest risk,
            according to JPMorgan. That's when criminals contact people and try to trick them into handing over account
            details or other sensitive information. The bank warned customers not to click links or download attachments
            on e-mails from unknown senders and to be wary of other suspicious communications. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said a previously disclosed data breach affected 76
            million households and 7 million small businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customer names, addresses, phone
            numbers and e-mail addresses were taken, the New York-based bank said today in a regulatory filing. Hackers

            breach affected anyone who visited the company's websites, including Chase.com, or used its mobile app, said
            the person, who requested anonymity because that information wasn't publicly disclosed. Some of those
            affected by the incursion are former clients of JPMorgan, which currently has 65 million customers and
            reaches half of all U.S. households, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic: Top U.S. Data Breaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, hasn't detected 'any unusual customer fraud' related to
            the attack, and clients aren't liable for unauthorized transactions that are promptly reported to the
            company, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There is no evidence that account information for
            such affected customers -' account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers
            '- was compromised during this attack,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Said to Relinquish Chairman Title at Bank Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon stepped down as chairman of the lender's
            main bank subsidiary at the start of July, according to a person
            briefed on the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, who serves as CEO and chairman of the parent
            company, handed off his post at the unit to William C. Weldon, a
            JPMorgan board member and former head of Johnson Johnson (JNJ), said
            the person, who asked not to be named because details of the
            move weren't announced. A regulatory document released yesterday
            listed Dimon as 'chairman emeritus' of the subsidiary, which
            runs JPMorgan's deposit and consumer banking operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sought to bolster corporate governance and
            rebuild its relationship with watchdogs after probes by
            regulators and a Senate panel faulted the firm for withholding
            information from U.S. overseers during trading losses last year.
            Dimon handed off the chairman title at the unit after company
            attorneys recommended it for technical reasons, rather than
            because of pressure from regulators or investors, said the
            person, who's familiar with the bank's thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
            Dimon's status as chairman emeritus at the unit was disclosed in
            JPMorgan's annual 'living will,' describing to regulators how
            the New York-based firm could be wound down in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mortgage-Investor Concerns Revive Amid JPMorgan Settlement Talks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A group of mortgage-bond investors
            urged U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder not to let banks saddle
            them with costs by pledging relief for borrowers to settle U.S.
            investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Association of Mortgage Investors, representing mutual
            funds and pensions, wrote a letter Oct. 7 to Holder after
            reports that JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) discussed settling government
            probes for $11 billion, including consumer relief. The letter,
            which doesn't mention the firm, asks that the group be included
            in talks with banks to ensure costs from the settlement aren't
            passed to buyers of the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We stand firmly behind the principle that parties sued by
            the government or third-parties should not be able to settle
            with assets that they do not own, namely other people's money,'
            the group wrote. 'We urge that any settlement must not allow
            bank-servicers to meet their obligations by using mortgages
            managed by them but which they do not 100 percent own.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-securities investors have criticized banks'
            previous settlements, saying that efforts to ease homeowners'
            burden can lower the value the instruments. The terms and size
            of New York-based JPMorgan's potential settlement changed
            repeatedly during talks last month, a person familiar with the
            matter said at the time. No deal has been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on the letter late
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Taps Taxpayer-Backed Banks for Bailout Rules</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, is using cheap funding from government-chartered
            institutions to meet new regulations designed to ensure it won't
            need a taxpayer bailout in any future crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank borrowed almost $20 billion in the first half of
            the year from Federal Home Loan Banks, according to filings,
            almost as much as it got from selling dollar-denominated bonds
            in 2013. New York-based JPMorgan, with $2.4 trillion of assets,
            obtained most of the loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
            Cincinnati, whose 740 members typically resemble the $139
            million-asset Bank of McCreary County in Kentucky and $40
            million-asset Rural Cooperatives Credit Union. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Set up during the Great Depression to help community
            lenders, FHLBs raise cash by selling bonds viewed by rating
            companies and investors as backed by the U.S. government.
            Lending by the Congressionally chartered banks is climbing at
            the fastest pace since the start of the financial crisis in
            2007. The growth has little to do with most of the 7,600 banks,
            thrifts, credit unions and insurers that are members. Without
            JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the three
            largest borrowers, lending by the FHLBs would be shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;With the deadline for avoiding a
            U.S. default looming, investors from Boston to Bangalore are
            moving to cash, extending the maturities of their short-term
            Treasury holdings and buying options to help protect themselves
            should stock and bond prices tumble. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) private bank clients are raising
            cash while others are dumping Treasury bills with maturities
            beyond the Oct. 17 debt ceiling deadline for longer-dated bonds.
            Stewart Capital Advisors LLC in Indiana, Pennsylvania, favors
            insurance companies, technology stocks and health-care
            providers, which now have lower valuations. Money is flowing out
            of an exchange-traded fund that tracks American banks and into
            overseas equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While most investors say a default will be averted, the
            potential for calamity should political leaders fail to renew
            U.S. borrowing authority before it runs out is moving some to
            take measures to safeguard their assets. A Treasury Department
            report on Oct. 3 said consequences would be 'catastrophic'
            should the U.S. fail to make payments, including higher interest
            rates, lower investment and slow growth for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We want to protect capital first,' said Kevin Kearns, a
            fixed-income portfolio manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles
            Co., which manages $188 billion. While Loomis is forecasting
            that a default will be avoided, the back-and-forth negotiations
            may provoke some investors to sell assets. 'We have our
            shopping list ready if things go on sale,' Kearns said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long Short &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kearns oversees $1.4 billion in a strategy known as long-short, where an investor can speculate on
            a security's price
            either rising or falling. The Standard Poor's 500 Index jumped
            2.2 percent to 1,692.56 at 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stocks rallied as U.S. House Republican leaders embraced a
            possible short-term deal to avoid default. The lawmakers will
            present their members with a proposal to raise the debt limit
            for six weeks without policy conditions, a congressional aide
            familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The House wants to 'offer the president today the ability
            to move' and ask 'for his willingness to sit down and discuss
            with us a way forward,' Speaker John Boehner said today to
            reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETF Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors withdrew $4 billion from ETFs that track U.S
            equities between Oct. 3 and 8, data compiled by Bloomberg on
            fund flows show. At the same time, they added $418 million to
            the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, which buys European, Australian and
            Israeli shares, the most for any ETF tracked by Bloomberg. The
            Vanguard FTSE Europe fund got $385 million, the second most. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, investors withdrew $780 million from the
            Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund tracking financial companies
            in the SP 500, the most since April 2010, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
            Index, used to hedge against stock swings, saw record volume of
            1.78 million contracts on Oct. 8. Traders bought almost double
            the number of calls to buy compared with puts to sell that day,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. Owning bullish options on the
            VIX, as the index is known, can offset losses when stocks drop
            because they become more valuable as price swings widen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Last Minute &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most investors have yet to become concerned that the debt
            ceiling will be breached, citing the last-minute resolution of
            the August 2011 showdown as a model that shows a deal will be
            achieved in time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'None of my investors have so far called me to say 'I want
            out,' or ask 'Is this really a crisis situation?'' Jim Paulsen,
            the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells
            Capital Management, which oversees about $340 billion, said in a
            telephone interview. 'The American psyche is in much better
            position today. They don't look at every issue as Armageddon.
            It's just another problem. They are not rushing to gold or U.S.
            Treasuries or to the dollar.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 41 percent of investors in a TD Ameritrade Holding
            Corp. survey said they haven't made changes to their investments
            as a result of the government shutdown that began Oct. 1 or a
            possible default. Twelve percent said they're 'taking advantage
            of opportunities,' and 10 percent said they've moved into cash
            in the immediate term, according to the poll of 693 consumers
            conducted Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Treasury Bills &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Concern that a default might happen is starting to show up
            in the market for short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasury bill rates rose after President Barack Obama
            rejected calls Oct. 8 to invoke the Constitution's 14th
            Amendment to skirt Congressional approval for issuing new debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rates on Treasury bills due on Oct. 17 fell 17 basis
            points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 0.31 percent at 5 p.m. New
            York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched
            0.51 percent earlier, the highest level since they were sold in
            October 2012. The yield was negative as recently as Sept. 26.
            The rate on bills maturing on Nov. 14 rose as high as 0.275
            percent yesterday, compared with 0.02 percent on Sept. 30. Rates
            on bills due Nov. 21 rose eight basis points to 0.12 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some investors have been 'rolling out those Treasury bills
            to future maturities' in December and into 2014, Megan McClellan, head of U.S. fixed income at JPMorgan
            Private Bank in
            New York, said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday.
            'For people that are nervous, rolling forward is OK, and also
            going to cash. We have seen, as we saw in 2011, some percentage
            going to deposits.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Money Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money-market mutual funds can cope with a short-term
            default in U.S. Treasuries as long as it doesn't trigger the
            kind of investor run that followed the collapse of Lehman
            Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, according to Fitch Ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The funds have high levels of short-term liquidity and have
            reduced their holdings of Treasuries that would be most
            immediately affected by the failure of the U.S. to extend its
            borrowing capacity, the ratings company said yesterday in a
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have avoided maturities in the time period toward the
            end of October,' Nancy Prior, head of money funds at Boston-based Fidelity Investments, said in an
            interview. Fidelity is
            the largest manager of U.S. money funds with $427 billion in
            assets as of Aug. 31, according to Crane Data LLC in
            Westborough, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Borrowing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market for corporate borrowing through IOUs expanded to
            the highest level in eight months as investors turned to
            alternatives to short-term Treasury bills amid the impasse over
            raising the U.S. debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
            outstanding climbed $11 billion to $1.066 trillion in the week
            ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
            That's the highest level since the market touched $1.085
            trillion for the period ended Feb. 13, according to Fed data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Fidelity has sought to avoid Treasury bills maturing
            near the deadline, Pacific Investment Management Co. has been
            buying them as their yields have risen, said co-chief investment
            officer Bill Gross, manager of the world's largest bond fund at
            Pacific Management Investment Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Their selling begets opportunistic buying on the part of
            Pimco,' Gross said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
            'We're picking up pennies on the street. This is a particular
            penny that we think is risk-free.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Equities Collars &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong's futures and options market operator, Hong Kong
            Exchanges Clearing Ltd., increased the discount on Treasury
            bills used as collateral for margin requirements today, citing
            concern that the U.S. is at risk of a default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Japan, investors sold 2.2 trillion yen ($22.5 billion)
            of foreign bonds in the week ended Oct. 4, the most on record,
            according to figures released by the Ministry of Finance in
            Tokyo. The report didn't reveal the amount of Treasuries sold by
            the Japanese bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney
            Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, the dip in stock prices
            may become a chance to increase his ownership of U.S. equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Where we are holding significant cash we have been
            nibbling,' Luschini said in an e-mail response to questions on
            Oct. 9. He added to his equity positions as the SP 500 fell to
            1,660 and 'we will buy more aggressively if we near 1,600, all
            things being equal.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;VIX Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors who are concerned about a default should use an
            options strategy known as a collar on their largest or most
            volatile equity holdings, according to Randy Frederick, managing
            director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab
            Corp. in Austin, Texas. To implement the trade, investors buy a
            put, or option to sell, with an exercise price below the current
            stock level, financed by selling call options with a higher
            strike price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Randall Warren, chief investment officer of Warren
            Financial Service, purchased options on the VIX as protection
            against surging stock volatility if the U.S. defaults on its
            debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warren said he bought calls that become profitable if the
            VIX rises 12 percent to 22 by Oct. 16, the day before U.S.
            borrowing authority lapses. He also purchased calls with a 32
            strike price for October to protect against bigger swings in the
            equity market, as well as 22 and 32 contracts that expire in
            November as a hedge if the talks are extended. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Buying these options very, very cheaply and getting the
            explosive upside if something serious does occur with the
            markets, then that is a way to hedge your bets without a whole
            lot of money,' Warren, who oversees about $100 million, said in
            a phone interview from Exton, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Worst Case' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has gained 0.7 percent since the U.S.
            government shut down last week. The VIX slid 0.7 percent to
            16.48 over the same period, as a 16 percent tumble today erased
            an advance to as high as 20.34 on Oct. 8. That compares to a
            level of 48 when SP cut the U.S. debt rating in August 2011,
            the highest since before the bull market started in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Supreeth S.M., the Bangalore-based chief executive officer
            at Quant First Asset Advisors India, bought put options on the
            nation's CNX Nifty Index stock gauge with an exercise price 10
            percent below the index level to protect against the 'worst
            case scenario' of a U.S. default. He's funding the trade by
            selling call options on the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A U.S. default is highly unlikely as we expect lawmakers
            to come around to avert a disaster,' Supreeth, whose firm
            manages about $100 million in options, said in a phone interview
            on Oct. 8. 'However, something bad may happen and we are
            advising clients to hedge.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Puts with a strike price 10 percent below the Nifty cost
            8.2 points more than calls betting on a 10 percent gain on Oct.
            8, the least since Sept. 19, one-month implied volatility data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. The Indian stock index, which has
            climbed 2 percent this year, tumbled 26 percent in October 2008,
            the month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
            bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Treasury Hedges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS Global Asset Management, a money manager that oversees
            $644 billion, said it has bought Treasury options to hedge
            against the U.S. defaulting should politicians fail to agree on
            raising the nation's debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company bought two-year Treasury puts and sold those on
            German two-year note futures to mitigate the risk, according to
            Brian Fehrenbach, the company's Chicago-based co-head of U.S.
            multi-sector fixed income. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's part of our defensive strategy and it's something
            we hope will not be tested,' Fehrenbach, a former derivatives
            trader, said in an interview in London. 'The uncertainty in
            Washington doesn't promote confidence. The longer they go
            without a resolution, the more risk there is for a last-minute
            mistake.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Money Funds Sold Default-Threatened Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the second-biggest provider of U.S. money-market mutual funds, said those
            products had divested of U.S. Treasuries that mature between
            Oct. 16 and Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said it took the action, which also applies to
            funds with scheduled coupon payments during the period, to help
            maintain the products' stable $1 a share value. The funds have
            also increased their levels of liquidity, the New York-based
            company said today in a statement, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Although JPMorgan Investment Management continues to
            believe that the probability of a U.S. government default is
            low, it has taken certain precautionary measures with respect to
            the money markets,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;House Speaker John Boehner today proposed a plan that would
            push the limit for U.S. borrowing to Nov. 22 from Oct. 17. The
            White House endorsed the short debt-limit increase with no
            policy conditions attached. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
            warned that 'uncertainty' over the debt limit is starting to
            stress financial markets, speaking in testimony to the Senate
            Finance Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. money funds held about $475 billion in Treasury
            securities as of Aug. 31, and an additional $156 billion in
            repurchase agreements collateralized by Treasuries, according to
            research firm Crane Data LLC in Westborough, Massachusetts.
            About $74 billion in Treasuries held by money funds matures from
            Oct. 24 to Nov. 15, Crane Data estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fitch Report &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money funds can cope with a short-term default in U.S.
            Treasuries as long as it doesn't trigger the kind of investor
            run that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
            in 2008, Fitch Ratings said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fitch based its conclusion partly on evidence that fund
            companies had reduced holdings in maturities most likely to be
            affected by a default and had boosted the level of assets that
            could be quickly converted into cash and returned to withdrawing
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Institutional investors in money-market mutual funds that
            focus almost exclusively on Treasury securities and other debt
            backed by the U.S. government withdrew $17.5 billion in the
            seven days through yesterday, according to Crane Data. That's
            about 2.6 percent of assets in those funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based company that is the
            largest U.S. money-fund manager, said earlier this week that it
            had moved out of Treasuries maturing in late October and early
            November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fund provider Federated Investors Inc. (FII), based in
            Pittsburgh, said it wasn't avoiding that time period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'No Threat' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to hold Treasury securities that mature in
            the upcoming weeks and are confident that they represent no
            threat to the liquidity or stability of the portfolio,' Meghan McAndrews, a Federated spokeswoman, said
            today in an e-mailed
            statement. 'We believe that, at the end of the day, the parties
            in this conflict will come to a resolution that will prevent the
            U.S. government from defaulting on its obligations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vanguard Group Inc., the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based
            fund company, doesn't expect a default, Chief Executive Officer
            William McNabb said today in an interview on Bloomberg
            Television. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Within the walls of Vanguard, we continue to be
            optimistic about cooler heads prevailing,' McNabb said. 'The
            idea that the U.S. would actually default on Treasuries seems
            almost unfathomable to us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Funding Standoff &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Republican lawmakers in Washington had vowed not to approve
            an increase in the government's debt limit unless President
            Barack Obama and his Democratic Party agree to change the
            Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, known as
            Obamacare. They have also refused to approve new funding for
            government operations, triggering a partial government shutdown
            since Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money-market funds give millions of households, companies
            and other institutions a safe parking spot for cash and channel
            $2.6 trillion to issuers of short-term debt including the U.S.
            government, financial institutions and companies. A run on funds
            that hold corporate debt after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
            in September 2008 helped freeze global credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>India in Talks With JPMorgan to Join Bond Indexes, Reuters Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Indian policy makers are in talks
            with JPMorgan Chase Co. and other companies for inclusion of
            the nation's debt in bond indexes to boost capital inflows,
            Reuters reported. The rupee surged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram and other
            officials plan meetings in the U.S. next week with fund managers
            including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Standard Life
            Plc, Reuters said without naming its sources. India may ease
            some restrictions on foreign purchases of its debt if necessary
            for inclusion, the report said. Reserve Bank of India Governor
            Raghuram Rajan said on Sept. 20 that talks would be held with
            index providers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An opening up of the bond market will lead to inflows,'
            said Paresh Nayar, head of currency and money markets at
            FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. 'There is an expectation that some
            real developments are now happening after Rajan had flagged the
            possibility earlier.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lombard Odier Investment Management and Aletti Gestielle
            Sgr SpA say India needs to remove all restrictions in its bond
            market, and Standard Chartered Plc estimates that inclusion in
            JPMorgan's GBI-Global Diversified Index could lure as much as
            $40 billion over 12 months. India caps foreign purchases of
            local-currency debt at $81 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan 'cannot comment on market speculation,' Mumbai-based spokeswoman Beverly Mathews said in
            an e-mailed reply to
            Bloomberg. E-mails sent to the media teams at Pimco and Standard
            Life didn't immediately get a response. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The potential meetings follow the announcement yesterday
            that International Finance Corp., the World Bank's investment
            arm, plans to sell a record $1 billion of rupee bonds offshore
            to fund its investments. The move 'should support investor
            confidence further,' Citigroup Inc. strategist Gaurav Garg
            wrote in a research report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas funds have cut holdings of rupee-denominated bonds
            to $25.9 billion as of Oct. 9, official data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee rose 0.9 percent today, reversing a drop of as
            much as 0.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            The currency is still 10.4 percent weaker this year, weighed
            down by a current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Shrinks Investment Bank Compensation Pool 4.4%</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and
            investment bank allocated 4.4 percent less for employee
            compensation in the first nine months of the year as the
            division's revenue climbed 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $8.69 billion in compensation fell to 31 percent
            of revenue, excluding accounting adjustments, from 34 percent in
            the same period of 2012, according to figures posted today on
            the New York-based firm's website. The amount equals $165,774
            for each of the division's 52,445 employees. The unit employed
            52,226 people a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, combined its
            investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and
            securities-services units last year under co-heads Mike Cavanagh, 47, and Daniel Pinto, 50. The group has
            more than
            twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
            years. Figures for average pay don't represent what individuals
            actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We really believe in pay for performance,' Cavanagh told
            shareholders in February. JPMorgan's scale can help keep the
            compensation-to-revenue ratio low while offering top employees
            pay at least as good as competitors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. lender, said it will halt clearing services for about 500
            foreign banks and discontinue checking accounts for
            'politically exposed persons' in other nations. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dimon Says JPMorgan Doing 'Very Little' Repurchasing of Shares</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which today
            reported its first loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, said it has scaled back stock
            repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank repurchased $739.7 million of shares in the third
            quarter, down from $1.17 billion in the three months ended June
            30 and $2.58 billion in the first quarter, according to a
            supplemental filing posted on the New York-based lender's
            website today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're doing very little stock buyback right now,' Dimon
            said today on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
            last month that the lender could be forced to halt its $6
            billion repurchase program as fines and penalties on the bank
            grow. The third-quarter loss was fueled by a $7.2 billion charge
            tied to litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank executives were asked today about the possibility of
            litigation expenses affecting capital plans submitted to
            regulators or altering the pace of share repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't expect or believe that there should be any
            repercussions, but they're ultimately up to the regulators'
            decisions,' Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan suspended a $15 billion buyback plan last year to
            boost capital levels after a bet on credit derivatives in London
            that ultimately cost the firm more than $6.2 billion. Dimon in
            March won conditional Federal Reserve approval for $6 billion in
            buybacks. The Fed required the company to 'address weaknesses'
            in its planning process. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Posts First Loss on $7.2 Billion Legal Cost</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. reported its first loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon after taking a
            $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            third-quarter loss was $380 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a profit of $5.71 billion, or $1.40,
            a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. The last time the bank failed to
            report a profit was the second quarter of 2004, when William Harrison was CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Over the
            last few weeks the environment has become highly charged and very volatile,' Chief Financial Officer
            Marianne Lake said on a conference call. 'Things have been very fluid and the situation escalated to the
            point where we are facing very large premiums and penalties, the level of which have gone far beyond what we
            reasonably expected.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, who led JPMorgan to record earnings in each of the past
            three years, is grappling with regulatory investigations and tightening internal controls following a
            trading loss last year of more than $6.2 billion. The legal costs contributed to a 54 percent surge in
            non-interest expenses to $23.6 billion, as revenue dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Very
            Painful' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is very painful for the company,' Dimon told analysts on the call.
            JPMorgan has spent $8 billion on litigation and set aside $20 billion toward legal and regulatory costs
            since January 2010. Those expenses will remain elevated for the next year or two, according to Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $5.12
            million of two-year notes that yield five times Banco Bilbao
            Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)'s gains, the first offering linked to the
            lender since at least January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Oct. 8, pay a maximum of 40 percent
            with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with
            the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan valued the
            notes at 95 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
            declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BBVA, Spain's second-biggest bank, issued $1.5 billion of
            contingent convertible bonds in April, the first European bank
            to sell the securities complying with new rules governing how
            they can be employed to bolster balance sheets. The bank is
            using the proceeds for its Tier 1 capital, the riskiest segment.
            The bonds automatically convert to stock if the bank's Tier 1
            ratio falls below 5.125 percent of assets weighted by risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bilbao-based bank rose 28 percent this year to 8.94
            euros ($12.14) at the close of trading in Madrid today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on U.S.
            SEC-registered structured notes in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create the securities by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley Funds Join JPMorgan in Shunning Some Treasuries</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) Investment Management
            told clients its money-market funds aren't holding Treasuries
            that mature in the next month as Congress debates whether to
            raise the U.S. debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's money-market portfolios don't own Treasuries
            that mature between tomorrow and Nov. 20, the Morgan Stanley
            unit said in its Investor Insights publication for this month.
            The prime portfolios have no Treasury exposure, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our portfolio management team has taken a conservative
            stance on U.S. Treasury bills and notes in anticipation of
            congressional gridlock around raising the debt ceiling,' the
            firm wrote. 'We felt it prudent to avoid the potential price
            volatility near the estimated deadline as well as eliminate any
            possible need to sell those securities later at potentially less
            favorable prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the second-biggest provider of U.S.
            money-market mutual funds, said last week that those products
            had divested Treasuries that mature between Oct. 16 and Nov. 6.
            Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based company that is the
            largest U.S. money-fund manager, also said it had moved out of
            Treasuries maturing in late October and early November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $100 Million Fine on CFTC London Whale Claim</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the largest U.S. bank, agreed to pay $100 million to resolve Commodity Futures
            Trading Commission claims that the company's London traders last year deployed a reckless strategy in
            derivatives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord, which stems from the bank's chief investment office's conduct
            on Feb. 29, 2012, brings JPMorgan's settlements from the London Whale trades to more than $1 billion, the
            CFTC said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's traders tried to defend their position in
            credit derivatives 'by dumping a gargantuan, record-setting, volume of swaps virtually all at once,
            recklessly ignoring the obvious dangers to legitimate pricing forces,' David Meister, the CFTC's head of
            enforcement, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank agreed in September to pay
            $920 million to resolve related U.S. and U.K. probes into its internal controls and handling of the trades,
            which inflicted at least $6.2 billion in losses on the bank last year. The accords don't end all of the
            investigations into the bets managed by Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale because his
            positions were large enough to move markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The selling cited by the CFTC was a
            'manipulative device' that disregarded consequences to the broader market, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe
            Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said the bank neither admitted nor denied the CFTC's legal conclusion
            that there was a violation, while admitting to 'certain facts set out in the order.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Middle
            Ground &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The admission of the facts represents a middle ground between settlements where
            a party neither admits nor denies anything and those where a party admits to a violation of the law, Dan
            Waldman, a Washington-based partner at law firm Arnold Porter LLP, said in a telephone interview. The accord
            preserves the bank's ability to defend against future civil claims related to the London trades, he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The London Whale in a Nutshell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It does make it easier for them to
            defend future cases,' said Waldman, a former CFTC general counsel who represents exchanges, brokerages and
            investment funds in regulatory matters before his former agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord following the CFTC's 17-month investigation relies on Dodd-Frank Act powers
            to combat market manipulation. The 2010 financial-regulatory law broadened the agency's ability to bring
            enforcement cases, allowing lawyers to demonstrate reckless trading instead of a higher standard of intent
            and success at actual manipulation of a market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Defending Position &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            traders on Feb. 29, 2012, tried to defend their position in credit-default swaps to stem losses, according
            to the CFTC. The bank sold more than $7 billion of swaps that day, including $4.6 billion in a three-hour
            period, the agency said. The sales accounted for more than 90 percent of the day's net volume traded by the
            entire market, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The facts as admitted by the bank are that they acted
            recklessly with regard to the fundamental precept that prices in the swap market be established by
            legitimate forces of supply and demand,' CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bart Chilton, a Democratic CFTC commissioner, said in a statement that he wouldn't have supported
            the order without the bank's admission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;O'Malia Dissent &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott
            O'Malia, a Republican commissioner, dissented from the decision and said the agency should have taken more
            time to demonstrate whether the bank is liable for price manipulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The commission's
            abbreviated investigation has failed to determine whether JPMorgan intentionally or recklessly manipulated
            the price of a particular type of credit default swap index,' O'Malia said in his statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Securities and Exchange Commission has said its inquiry remains open while the U.S. Justice Department runs
            a parallel probe. Iksil, who prosecutors have said is cooperating with their case, hasn't been charged. The
            CFTC's enforcement division decided against recommending an enforcement against against JPMorgan traders,
            according to the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April last year, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            initially dismissed reports that the derivatives bets were distorting markets, calling the attention a
            'tempest in a teapot.' The bank disclosed mounting losses a month later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank
            admitted in its SEC settlement that internal oversight of the trades suffered from lapses and that the firm
            violated federal securities laws. The company's handling of the trades also has been faulted by Senate
            investigators, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and U.K. Financial
            Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Resolving Probes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sought in the
            past few months to resolve probes into businesses including energy trading, credit-card lending and bundling
            of mortgages into bonds. The bank said Oct. 11 it took a $7.2 billion charge for expenses tied to regulatory
            matters and litigation, leading to its first quarterly loss during Dimon's tenure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            company has yet to resolve state and federal probes into its mortgage-bond sales, including a criminal
            inquiry. JPMorgan has been discussing a potential $11 billion deal with authorities looking into that
            business, a person with knowledge of the talks said in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has agreed to
            sell 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the tower built by David Rockefeller, to Fosun International Ltd., the
            investment arm of
            China's biggest closely held industrial group, for $725 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fosun, which invests in properties, pharmaceuticals and
            steel, is buying the 60-story, 2.2 million square-foot, lower
            Manhattan tower, according to a statement it filed to Hong
            Kong's stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's developers and companies are expanding in overseas
            property markets as the government maintains curbs on housing at
            home to cool prices. Greenland Holding Group Co., a Shanghai-based, state-owned developer, this month agreed
            to buy a 70
            percent stake in a residential and commercial real estate
            project in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a lot of excess capital in China that needs a way
            out at the moment,' Simon Lo, Hong Kong-based executive
            director for Asia research and advisory at property broker
            Colliers International, said in a phone interview today. 'Also,
            by investing in markets like New York, they believe they can
            gain from the recovery of the U.S. economy and real estate
            market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fosun (656), owned by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, fell
            0.3 percent to HK$6.79 at the midday trading break in Hong Kong.
            Shares in the Shanghai-based company have gained 37 percent this
            year, compared with the 2.6 percent increase in the benchmark
            Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil SA's pension fund,
            Latin America's largest, will invest in U.S. and European stocks
            through funds of money managers including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) as it seeks to diversify holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Previ, as the Rio de Janeiro-based pension fund is known,
            is setting up its first vehicle to invest in large foreign
            firms, Chief Investment Officer Rene Sanda said today, adding
            that it will also invest through funds run by Schroders Plc and
            Franklin Templeton Investments. The fund, in which Previ will
            have a 25 percent stake will be managed by BB Gestao de Recursos
            DTVM SA, the asset manager that is also a Banco do Brasil unit,
            he said. Other Brazilian pension funds will participate in the
            fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BB DTVM will invest in funds already constituted by these
            four managers, it's a feeder,' Sanda told reporters today in
            Rio. The objective is 'portfolio diversification, not
            returns.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Previ, which manages 164 billion reais ($75.4 billion) for
            Banco do Brasil employees, has approved global investments of as
            much as 340 million reais this year in foreign stocks that may
            include Google Inc. (GOOG), said Antonio Luiz Benevides, executive
            manager of the fund. The pension fund may also invest in fixed-income and private equity abroad in the
            future as it accelerates
            real-estate investments in Brazil, he said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund for international stocks is expected to be set up
            by mid-November, Sanda said today, declining to give an estimate
            of its size until completion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's pension funds reported an average loss of 0.7
            percent in the first half, according to to the Brazilian pension
            fund association, known as Abrapp. Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa
            index fell 22 percent during that period while Google, based in
            Mountain View, California, rallied 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan $13 Billion Accord Would Join Largest U.S. Pacts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is preparing to
            pay $13 billion to end U.S. civil probes of its mortgage-bond
            sales, an amount that ranks among the largest settlements by a
            single company and dwarfs fines previously imposed by the
            Justice Department. Past accords include: &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- The $246 billion settlement by the biggest U.S. tobacco
            companies in 1998 to resolve state government claims for the
            costs of treating sick smokers. Philip Morris Cos. and R.J.
            Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. were among firms that reached
            agreement with 50 state attorneys general to pay out the money
            over 25 years, scale back marketing and take steps to reduce
            youth smoking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- Pledges by Wall Street firms including UBS AG and Citigroup
            Inc. to repurchase more than $50 billion of auction-rate
            securities to settle state and federal complaints. Firms
            allegedly touted the instruments as safe, cash-like investments
            before the $330 billion market froze in February 2008, stranding
            investors who could no longer sell their holdings. The accords
            returned more than $67 billion to investors, the Securities and
            Exchange Commission has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- The $25 billion in payments and relief for troubled borrowers
            that five U.S. lenders -- JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp.,
            Citigroup, Wells Fargo Co. and Ally Financial Inc. -- pledged
            to resolve probes into mishandled foreclosures as part of a
            February 2012 deal with federal regulators and state attorneys
            general. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- BP Plc's $4.53 billion in settlements last year with the
            Justice Department and SEC, including a $1.26 billion criminal
            fine, relating to the April 2010 Macondo well blowout and
            explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 workers and set
            off the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, BP promised President Barack Obama it would set up
            a $20 billion trust fund for claims and costs. The company has
            so far spent at least $26 billion on the cleanup, reimbursements
            and other payments, and booked more than $42 billion in pretax
            charges related to the spill, according to statements on its
            website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- GlaxoSmithKline Plc's $3 billion to resolve criminal and
            civil allegations that it illegally promoted prescription drugs
            and failed to report safety data. The July 2012 settlement, the
            largest ever in a health-care fraud case in the U.S., included a
            $956.8 million criminal fine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- Pfizer Inc.'s $2.3 billion settlement in 2009, which included
            a $1.2 billion criminal fine, for illegally marketing the anti-inflammatory drug Bextra for uses that the
            Food and Drug
            Administration specifically had declined to approve because of
            safety concerns. The criminal fine was the largest ever imposed
            in the U.S. for any matter, then-Associate Attorney General Tom
            Perrelli said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- HSBC Holdings Plc's $1.9 billion deal to resolve charges it

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Executive Macris Challenges London Whale Report</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, a former JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) executive in Europe, will appeal findings by the
            U.K. markets watchdog that criticizes his actions after losses
            caused by Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Macris was 'deprived of the opportunity of responding' to
            the Financial Conduct Authority, a spokesman for his lawyers at
            Clifford Chance LLP said in an e-mailed statement today. Macris,
            who led the international Chief Investment Office, said the
            findings from September were 'made in error' and he will
            challenge them in a U.K. tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA's 'assertions fail to take proper account of the
            actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings with the
            Authority at the relevant time,' the spokesman, Michael
            Osborne, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of the New York-based bank, characterized the $6.2 billion
            loss last year as
            'the stupidest and most embarrassing situation I have ever been
            a part of.' The bad bets led to an earnings restatement, a U.S.
            Senate subcommittee hearing and $920 million in penalties from
            regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission and
            the FCA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July 2012, JPMorgan said it would restate its first-quarter net revenue by $660 million because
            it wasn't confident
            that the valuations of the bank's derivatives trades were
            accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Deliberately Misled' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'conduct of CIO London management deliberately misled
            the authority about the situation' according to the FCA's
            notice on the fine, which is published on the agency's website.
            Macris wasn't mentioned by name in the FCA's findings following
            its investigation into Iksil, who was known as the London Whale
            because the size of his bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA, declined to
            immediately comment. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on Macris. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iksil's former boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, and junior
            trader Julien Grout were indicted in the U.S. in September on
            five charges each, including securities fraud and conspiracy,
            for allegedly seeking to hide losses as they began to mount.
            Prosecutors have said Iksil, who wasn't charged, is cooperating
            with them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo and Grout are not in the U.S. and haven't
            returned to face the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Record JPMorgan Settlement Wouldn't Deter Some Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) tentative agreement to pay a record $13 billion to end civil claims over
            its sales of mortgage bonds, a deal that won't absolve the bank of potential criminal liability, hasn't
            shaken some investors' faith in Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Billionaire
            Home Depot Inc. founder Ken Langone said he sees the accord as a buying opportunity. The pact with the U.S.
            Justice Department would resolve claims that the bank, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.
            misleadingly packaged and sold mortgage-backed securities. JPMorgan, which acquired both lenders at the
            government's urging in 2008, fell 10 cents to $54.20 at 12:28 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            brunt of this misbehavior occurred before Jamie or JPMorgan had anything to do with these two companies,'
            Langone, 78, said yesterday in a telephone interview. 'I'm very, very comfortable as an investor in
            JPMorgan.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, personally negotiated the terms in a call with U.S. Attorney
            General Eric Holder after markets closed Oct. 18. The government's mounting demand for payments tied to Bear
            Stearns and WaMu had frustrated the CEO's push to end probes this year, driving legal reserves to $23
            billion and causing the New York-based bank's first quarterly loss under his watch. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Settlement Said to Include Money for Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s tentative $13
            billion settlement will include about $3 billion for states and
            federal regulators, much of which may be passed on to investors
            who bought faulty mortgage-backed securities, according to two
            people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement will also cover a $2 billion penalty against
            the bank, $4 billion for the Federal Housing Finance Agency,
            which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and about $4 billion
            to help homeowners in hard-hit metropolitan areas, according to
            the people, who asked not to be identified because the accord
            hasn't been finalized and negotiations aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
            settle multiple civil claims that the company misrepresented the
            quality of mortgage-bonds that were packaged and sold at the
            height of the U.S. housing boom by JPMorgan as well as by Bear
            Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc., both of which were
            acquired by the New York-based bank in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the settlement will help compensate investors who
            bought securities from all three entities, the bank won't pay
            fines for misdeeds committed by Bear Stearns and Washington
            Mutual, the people said. The accord wouldn't release JPMorgan or
            its executives from possible criminal liability, a person
            familiar with the settlement's terms said on Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is still working
            out final details of the record settlement with the U.S.
            Department of Justice, including a statement of facts, the
            people said. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New
            York, didn't reply to calls and e-mails seeking comment. Adora
            Andy Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New York &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some pieces might not be concluded by the time a deal is
            announced, they said. Both sides are still working out the
            details of how to disburse the relief to homeowners and
            investors, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $3 billion portion will be split between California
            Attorney General Kamala Harris, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the Federal Deposit Insurance
            Corp., National
            Credit Union Administration and possibly another state, the
            people said. New York state will receive about $500 million and
            will probably use it to reimburse investors, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported the
            breakdown of the settlement earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Guilty Plea Sought by Holder Shows Harder Stance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon went to Washington almost a month ago
            to see if U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder would settle a criminal probe of mortgage fraud at the bank if
            it paid more money to resolve related civil investigations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holder's team, which
            included Deputy Attorney General James Cole and Associate Attorney General Tony West, said ending the
            investigation by the U.S. attorney in Sacramento would require the bank to plead guilty to something,
            according to a person familiar with the talks, which were held in a conference room that was Robert F.
            Kennedy's office when he had Holder's job. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, the department proposed the bank plead
            guilty to making false statements related to sales of toxic mortgage bonds. The bank proposed a
            nonprosecution agreement, which Holder rejected, the person said. The bank agreed to assist the continuing
            criminal probe. The negotiation typifies the harder line the Obama administration is taking in its second
            term. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holder, 62, in an interview with Bloomberg News about the department's new
            aggressiveness on bank probes, said: 'It was clearly a priority for the president, it was a priority for me
            and for this Justice Department. One look at the magnitude of harm and the number of people suffering as a
            result of these acts that we're looking into made sense to me that my personal involvement was needed.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Eminence Seen Fading in Default Swaps: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s advantage
            over its Wall Street peers is fading in the eyes of credit-derivatives traders as fines and regulator probes
            hobble profits
            while firms from Citigroup Inc. to Morgan Stanley rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps traders are demanding 16 basis points
            less to protect against losses on JPMorgan bonds than the
            average cost to insure debt of the bank's five-biggest U.S.
            rivals, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The gap, a
            measure of the bank's credit strength relative to its
            competitors, has narrowed from an average 80 basis points since
            2008 and 152 in April 2012, the month before JPMorgan disclosed
            a trading loss that reached $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With regulatory fines and penalties that are poised to
            approach $15 billion, the playing field is leveling between the
            only Wall Street bank to stay profitable through the financial
            crisis and rivals that the credit seizure pushed to the edge of
            failure. Swaps tied to Citigroup, which last month removed the
            final vestiges of its government bailout, narrowed to within 6
            basis points of JPMorgan's for the first time since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'JPMorgan's Turn' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's JPMorgan's turn to have its own types of concerns,
            albeit ones that are much less severe from a credit perspective
            than the others' and in an improved economy, said Pri De Silva,
            a bank analyst at debt-research firm CreditSights Inc. in New
            York. For lenders such as Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan
            Stanley, 'the balance sheets are in much better shape now
            compared with credit-crisis days,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tentative JPMorgan Pact Said to Hit Snag Over FDIC Funds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) tentative
            agreement to pay a record $13 billion to end civil claims over
            its sales of mortgage bonds has hit a snag because of the bank's
            bid to make the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. liable for part
            of the payment, a person familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is opposing JPMorgan's request
            that the FDIC assume liability for investors' losses stemming
            from Washington Mutual Inc., the person, who sought anonymity to
            discuss the private negotiations, said today. JPMorgan acquired
            Washington Mutual's assets in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Resolving part of the $13 billion tentative agreement
            today, JPMorgan agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle Federal
            Housing Finance Agency claims related to home loans and
            mortgage-backed securities the bank sold to Fannie Mae (FNMA) and
            Freddie Mac. (FMCC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement includes $4 billion to resolve claims over
            mortgage bonds and $1.1 billion to settle claims that JPMorgan
            sold faulty mortgages directly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
            that the companies packaged into their own securities, the FHFA
            said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the FHFA agreement, JPMorgan preserved its right to seek
            FDIC reimbursement for FHFA claims stemming from Washington
            Mutual's estate, which is managed by the FDIC. JPMorgan has been
            in a legal battle with the FDIC over who should pay certain
            liabilities from the failed thrift, which the agency placed into
            receivership in 2008, selling JPMorgan the remaining assets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, co-head of JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and investment bank, sold $7.6 million
            in company stock in a pair of previously undisclosed
            transactions months ago, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A delay in reporting the sales, which occurred in April and
            July, 'was an error which we caught and corrected,' said Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the New York-based
            firm. The
            Securities and Exchange Commission requires transactions by
            corporate insiders to be disclosed within two business days,
            according to the agency's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pinto, 50, sold 73,000 shares valued at $3.56 million on
            April 29 and 73,247 shares valued at $4.06 million on July 15,
            according to yesterday's filing. The deals disposed of almost
            all of his direct holdings that would have been eligible for
            sale at the time, according to descriptions of his awards and
            their terms in January filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has risen 19 percent this year to $52.52 at 10:52
            a.m. in New York, trailing the 26 percent increase in the KBW
            Bank Index (BKX) of 24 U.S. lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pinto also exercised 400,000 stock options that gave him
            shares valued at about $22 million and sold 263,057 shares for
            $14.5 million to cover the cost of the transaction as well as
            his tax obligations on July 15, according to a July 17 filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Probe Prosecutor Put Away Tomato Racketeer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Benjamin Wagner, the top U.S.
            prosecutor for mostly rural eastern California, has busted the
            head of a tomato-packing company for racketeering and wrangled a
            settlement from a lumber company over a wildfire. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He's also prosecuted more than 250 people for mortgage
            fraud in a district that includes six of the 10 U.S. cities
            hardest hit by foreclosures since the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the typical bad guys Wagner targets are local
            mortgage brokers and foreclosure scam artists, he has one
            investigation that stands out. He's leading the criminal probe
            of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
            refused to close down when the government and the bank reached a
            tentative $13 billion settlement over mortgage-related
            malfeasance, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since Wagner's appointment by President Barack Obama in
            2009 as the U.S. attorney in Sacramento, the state capital, he's
            taken on the role of sheriff of the region's housing market.
            He's prosecuted people such as Eric Hernandez, a Bakersfield,
            California, home loan broker sentenced last month to about 11
            years in prison for cheating lenders, including JPMorgan, out of
            $6 million by submitting fraudulent applications to obtain
            loans. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has hired
            Andrew Castaldo from Bank of America Corp. (BAC) to help advise on oil
            and gas deals, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Castaldo will be based in New York report to Hernan Cristerna and Christopher Ventresca, JPMorgan's
            global co-heads
            of mergers and acquisitions, the document shows. The contents of
            the memo were confirmed by the bank's New York-based spokeswoman
            Tasha Pelio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Castaldo, who worked at Citigroup Inc. before joining Bank
            of America in 2006, helped advise Apache Corp. on its $7 billion
            purchase of assets from BP Plc in 2010. He also worked on
            Regency Energy Partners LP's $5.6 billion acquisition of PVR
            Partners LP, a natural gas pipeline and processing company,
            which was announced this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ventresca and Cristerna were named co-heads of global
            mergers and in May amid an overhaul of the top management of the
            team. Ventresca previously was JPMorgan's head of North
            American MA, while Cristerna oversaw MA for Europe,
            Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) are putting their top London currency dealers on
            leave after regulators probing the manipulation of foreign-exchange rates started investigating the traders'
            use of an instant-message group, three people with knowledge of the moves said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rohan
            Ramchandani, Citigroup's head of European spot trading, was told yesterday he will be placed on leave, said
            one of the people who asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorized to talk publicly. Richard
            Usher, JPMorgan's chief dealer in London, went on leave two weeks ago, said another person. Both are taking
            leave by mutual agreement with their employers and neither has been suspended, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) has also placed Matt Gardiner, its assistant chief dealer in the U.K.
            capital, on leave, a fourth person said Oct. 29. None of the traders has been accused of any wrongdoing.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulators are focusing on an instant-message group the traders set up to share
            information about their positions and client orders over a period of at least three years, four people with
            knowledge of the probe said this month. The roster of banks in the group changed as the men moved firms and
            also included Barclays Plc (BARC), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG (UBSN), three people with
            knowledge of the communications said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Operating Risk Rises With Past Seen as Prologue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has pledged billions of dollars to
            improve compliance and cybersecurity. That's not stopping regulators from treating the bank as if it were
            riskier than ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm's operational risk-weighted assets, a measure devised by
            regulators that determines how much capital the bank needs to hold against potential losses from human
            error, external threats, fraud and litigation, rose 6.7 percent in the second quarter to $400 billion,
            according to an August filing. Regulators can point to $23 billion of legal settlements last year and a
            cyber-attack discovered last month as they push JPMorgan to boost its buffer against unforeseen losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) that together racked
            up more than $100 billion in post-financial crisis legal costs are facing similar pressures. At JPMorgan,
            the largest U.S. bank, that means more than $35 billion that can't be used for dividends or buybacks,
            prompting Dimon to call it 'stranded capital.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Banks are saying, 'We've made huge
            investments in technology and compliance personnel and we aren't getting credit for it,'' said Justin
            Fuller, a senior director at Fitch Ratings in Chicago. 'At the same time, the only verifiable data points
            are these huge litigation costs they've just had, and it's hard to ignore those.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said it hired
            Naohisa Ando, a former managing director at Nomura Holdings
            Inc. (8604), as head of its new Japan capital market advisory
            department to boost its fundraising business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ando, 49, who helped lead equity capital markets operations
            at Nomura Securities Co., joined JPMorgan Securities Japan Co.
            last week, Yukako Yoshino, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for the
            U.S. firm, said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's stock rally and economic recovery helped companies
            raise 3.4 trillion yen ($34 billion) selling shares this year,
            more than triple the 901 billion yen issued a year earlier, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan is the No. 7 equity
            underwriter in the country, arranging offerings for firms
            including Suntory Beverage Food Ltd. (2587) and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ando began his career in 1987 as an analyst at Nomura
            Research Institute Ltd. after graduating from Hitotsubashi
            University in Tokyo, JPMorgan said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hackers who stole gigabytes of data from JPMorgan Chase Co. may have been trying to send a message
            that U.S. financial institutions can be disrupted, the former director of the National Security Agency said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FBI is investigating the cyberattack on JPMorgan and whether other banks were
            penetrated in retaliation for U.S.- backed sanctions on Russia, according to people familiar with the
            investigation who asked not to be identified because the probe is still underway. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic:

            U.S. banks. 'If it was them, they just sent a real message: 'You're vulnerable.'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As NSA
            chief and head of the U.S. Cyber Command, Alexander tracked and tried to thwart international hackers,
            giving him knowledge of their tactics. He was head of the NSA in 2008 when the country of Georgia was
            invaded by Russia and experienced a series of disruptive cyberattacks believed to be the work of Russian
            hackers. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Mary Callahan Erdoes got her first assignment managing money when she was 6
            years old. The eldest of four children, Erdoes showed an early aptitude for math that was fostered at her
            grandmother Kay's suburban Chicago breakfast table, where she helped balance her grandparents' checkbook on
            an adding machine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It was my first foray into money management,' Erdoes, 46, says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today, Erdoes oversees $2.2 trillion as chief executive officer of JPMorgan Asset Management, the
            sixth-largest money management operation in the U.S., according to data compiled by Pensions Investments, a
            publication that caters to the industry. Erdoes's unit includes everything from 401(k) assets to hedge
            funds, Bloomberg Markets magazine will report in its October issue. It produced a 24 percent return on
            equity last year compared with 9.7 percent at BlackRock Inc., the largest U.S. money manager, and 15.4

        <headline>Computers for Hire Send JPMorgan Data to Russia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s own investigators have found clues that a global network of computers
            available for hire by sophisticated criminals was used to reroute data stolen from the bank to a major
            Russian city, according to people familiar with the probe. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like street magicians using
            sleight of hand, the hackers tapped computers from Latin America to Asia to send commands and obscure their
            identity while ferrying malicious traffic past one of the most heavily guarded networks on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Graphic: Data Breaches in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank investigators working nearly around the
            clock have identified what they believe to be the assault's staging ground, called a 'bulletproof' hosting
            platform because of its resilience to other attackers and to law enforcement, according to one of the
            people, who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation. The constellation of computers was
            used in previous hacking attacks and is now being tapped by professional cybercriminals operating out of
            Eastern Europe to target banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Securing the Net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's
            investigators are only part of a larger group in the U.S. that includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation

            attack on JPMorgan and another this week on Home Depot Inc. and even the theft of nude photos from
            celebrities' online Apple Inc. accounts highlight how hard it is to defend against increasingly

        <headline>Rostelecom Said to Hire JPMorgan, Credit Suisse for Tele2 Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Rostelecom, Russia's state-run
            phone company, hired advisers to help it combine with wireless
            carrier Tele2 Russia to form a fourth mobile operator, a person
            briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The phone company hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Credit
            Suisse Group AG (CSGN) as advisers, said the person, who asked not to
            be identified as the discussions are private. State-controlled
            VTB Group (VTBR) acquired Swedish Tele2 AB's (TEL2B) Russian unit in a $3.55
            billion deal in April. While Rostelecom is majority owned by the
            state, it also has private shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A combination would help the two companies challenge market
            leaders OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT), OAO MegaFon (MFON) and VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)
            as the mobile-phone market in Russia expands with increased use
            of smartphones to browse the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rostelecom has almost 14 million mobile users, while Tele2
            Russia has 23 million. Working in different regions, the
            companies fit well together and would form a fourth countrywide
            wireless operator if combined, according to Konstantin Malofeev,
            a private shareholder in Rostelecom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks are proposing to combine the Moscow-based
            companies' wireless assets into a joint venture where Rostelecom
            would have control, Vedomosti reported today, citing
            unidentified sources. Rostelecom said last month it plans to
            finalize its strategy including wireless expansion in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrey Polyakov, a Moscow-based spokesman for Rostelecom,
            declined by phone to comment, as did Irina Rybakova, a
            spokeswoman for Tele2 Russia, and VTB's press office. JPMorgan
            and Credit Suisse press officials didn't immediately return
            calls requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Seeking Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rostelecom shares rose as much as 1.2 percent and traded up
            0.6 percent by 6:01 p.m. in Moscow, giving it a market value of
            $9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mobile TeleSystems and VimpelCom have said they've been
            seeking to acquire Tele2 Russia. Within Russia, MTS had almost
            72 million users at the end of the second quarter, while MegaFon
            had 64 million and VimpelCom had 57 million, according to
            researcher ACM Consulting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The potential integration of its mobile assets with Tele2
            will be a strategically logical development for Rostelecom,'
            Konstantin Chernyshev, a telecommunications analyst at VTB
            Capital, said in a note today. 'Any financial implications are
            hard to estimate at this point when the terms remain unclear.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and insurers
            reached a $300 million settlement with property owners who
            accused the companies of overcharging for hazard insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Assurant Inc. (AIZ) and other insurers will pay refunds
            valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium costs to homeowners who
            had the policies placed on their properties by the bank starting
            in January 2008, according to documents filed Sept. 6 in federal
            court in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Homeowners covered by the case stand 'to recover hundreds,
            if not thousands, of dollars as a result of the settlement,'
            lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a memorandum. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, was accused of placing
            mortgage borrowers' required hazard and wind coverage with
            Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates, covering costs of
            kickbacks to a JPMorgan unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The settlement will have no expected impact on our
            financials,' Amy Bonitatibus, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in
            an e-mailed statement. The insurance agreement at issue was
            discontinued this year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shawn Kahle, a spokeswoman for New York-based Assurant,
            didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
            settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Saccoccio v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 13-cv-21107, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of Florida
            (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Two to Board, Creates Lead Director Role</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the bank that
            incurred a $6.2 billion trading loss last year, will elect Linda B. Bammann and Michael A. Neal to its board
            and named Lee R. Raymond as lead independent director, giving him more powers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raymond, formerly presiding director, will have authority
            to call meetings at any time, approve agendas and add agenda
            items, and will guide the board in considering the succession of
            chief executive officers, New York-based JPMorgan said today in
            a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in May rejected a proposal to split the chairman
            and CEO roles, which advisory firms such as Institutional
            Shareholder Services said would improve oversight. The bank said
            today that the board will hold executive sessions without
            company management at every regular board meeting, make members
            available to meet with major shareholders and won't rotate the
            lead independent director position every year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bammann and Neal are 'proven leaders and will bring
            outstanding, risk, finance and management experience to our
            board,' Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
            year staved off a shareholder proposal to split the roles of
            Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein by agreeing to appoint an
            independent lead director. James J. Schiro, the former CEO of
            Zurich Financial Services AG and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP who
            joined Goldman Sachs's board in 2009, was named to the role in
            April 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BlackRock to JPMorgan See Deeper Emerging-Market Losses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street's biggest firms are
            predicting intensifying bond losses in emerging markets, where
            borrowing costs have already soared to the highest in more than
            four years versus U.S. corporate debt, as the Federal Reserve
            considers curtailing record stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not yet convinced that we've seen the worst in
            terms of flows out of emerging markets,' Jeffrey Rosenberg, the
            chief investment strategist in fixed-income at New York-based
            BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said in a
            telephone interview, expressing his own views. 'We see a lot of
            valuation change but we see the potential for even more
            valuation change.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have yanked $22.1 billion from emerging-market
            bond funds since the end of April, almost five times the amount
            pulled from U.S. corporate credit, according to EPFR Global.
            That's pushed the extra yield that buyers now demand to own
            dollar-denominated emerging-market debt instead of U.S. company
            notes to 1.4 percentage points, about the most since December
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs are soaring from record lows reached in
            January as speculation deepens that the Fed will curtail its so-called quantitative easing as soon as this
            month, signaling an
            end to the flood of cheap money that's propped up asset prices
            from India to China and Indonesia. The exodus from developing
            nations began after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress
            on May 22 that the central bank could scale back the pace of its
            $85 billion of purchases of mortgage bonds and Treasuries if the
            U.S. economy showed sustained improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan CEO Says 'Greener Pastures' in Trading Possible</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Record low volatility across equity
            and debt markets could ease next year, boosting Wall Street
            firms' trading operations, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unusually calm markets and low client activity that
            caused the worst first half in trading since the financial
            crisis will probably continue through the middle of 2015, Lake
            said today at a conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It may be a tale of two cities where the first half looks
            a little bit more like a continuation of some the things we'd
            been seeing this year, but there may be greener pastures in the
            second half,' Lake said. 'When things change, they can change
            very, very quickly, so we want to be positioned for that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, run by Daniel Pinto, posted a 12 percent revenue drop to
            $17.6 billion in the
            first six months of 2014. Firms may have to wait until 2016
            before markets significantly improve, Pinto said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will benefit from cost-cutting programs in retail
            and institutional units and 'more finality' on rules governing
            capital at the biggest banks, Lake said today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Madison Square Garden Enlists JPMorgan to Help Sell Fuse</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG), the
            sports and entertainment company that owns the namesake arena in
            Manhattan, hired JPMorgan Chase Co. to explore a sale of its
            music-TV channel Fuse. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been approached by certain parties expressing
            interest in Fuse and have retained JPMorgan to explore all
            strategic alternatives,' the New York-based company said today
            in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Selling Fuse would let the company's TV business focus on
            its more lucrative sports networks, which broadcast New York
            Knicks and Rangers games. Fuse could be worth $300 million to
            $400 million in a sale, said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie
            Group, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on MSG shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The music channel, which reaches about 64 million
            households, competes with networks such as Viacom Inc. (VIAB)'s MTV and
            VH1 and Mark Cuban's AXS TV. Fuse charges pay-TV providers about
            6 cents per month per customer, according to research firm SNL
            Kagan. That's far less than what popular sports networks fetch. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Madison Square Garden, which also owns real
            estate and sports teams, rose 1.6 percent to $55.99 at the close
            in New York. The stock has gained 26 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported earlier on the potential sale of
            Fuse. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Whale Fines Said to Reach at Least $750 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has agreed to pay at least $750 million to resolve U.S. and U.K.
            regulatory probes of its record trading loss last year, people with knowledge of the negotiations said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is seeking to settle as many inquiries as possible before the third quarter ends Sept. 30,
            the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Chief Financial Officer Marianne
            Lake told investors last week that the quarter's addition to legal reserves would 'more than offset' about
            $1.5 billion of consumer reserve releases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank's bad bets on derivatives, placed by
            U.K. trader Bruno Iksil, prompted authorities on two continents to open investigations into the firm's
            controls and disclosures last year as losses surpassed $6.2 billion. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the U.K.'s Financial
            Conduct Authority are among watchdogs planning to sanction the New York-based lender, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some settlements may be announced as early as this week, and total penalties may yet change, one of
            the people said. Iksil, who became known as the London Whale because his trading book was so large, agreed
            in June to testify against his colleagues after U.S. prosecutors promised not to charge him. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Stress Test Shows Lender Can Survive Shock</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, said internal stress tests show the company would
            come through an economic crisis with more than enough capital to
            stay in business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Tier 1 common ratio would be at least 8.5
            percent in a scenario designed to measure how the firm would
            perform during a severe crunch, the New York-based bank said
            today in a presentation on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank would show a net loss before taxes of $0.3 billion
            from the second quarter of 2013 through the middle of 2015, with
            $32.1 billion in loan losses and $17.5 billion in trading and
            counterparty losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks must run their own tests on how they
            would fare during a crisis to supplement those conducted by the
            Federal Reserve six months earlier. The central bank reports
            results each March based on different economic assumptions. The
            most recent round showed 17 of the 18 largest firms surviving a
            deep recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it would have been more conservative in its
            assumptions if it had been able to incorporate feedback from the
            Federal Reserve before running the results in late March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells
            Fargo Co. and Citigroup Inc. also concluded their firms would
            ride out a shock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it could handle a crisis that sends
            stocks down 40 percent and produces $20 billion in trading
            losses for the firm. Bank of America, ranked second by assets
            among U.S. lenders, foresaw a $26.1 billion cumulative deficit.
            Citigroup, ranked third by assets, found it would exceed capital
            minimums even after sustaining about $43 billion in loan losses
            and $10 billion in trading and counterparty losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are based in New York. Bank of
            America has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stock advanced 1.1 percent today to $53.14,
            bringing the gain for this year to 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

            Century Park property, a Los Angeles office complex where
            Creative Artists Agency has its headquarters, up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management is marketing the 3.2 million-square-foot (297,000-square-meter)
            Century Park on behalf of
            institutional investors, said Darin Oduyoye, a New York-based
            spokesman for the company. The property, located in the Century
            City business district, may fetch more than $2 billion, said a
            person with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be
            identified because the expected price isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complex has two 44-story towers housing high-end
            offices along with stores and restaurants, as well as a 4-acre
            (1.6-hectare) park and the Annenberg Space for Photography. A
            sale may come by the end of the year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC is the broker marketing the complex,
            Oduyoye said. Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil, didn't

            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) in April planned to market a 21-story
            building at 1888 Century Park East valued at more than $300
            million, two people with knowledge of the effort said at the
            time. &lt;/p&gt;

            legal woes while the bank undertakes an 'unprecedented effort'
            to comply with regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are all well aware of the news around the legal and
            regulatory issues facing our company, and in the coming weeks
            and months we need to be braced for more to come,' Dimon said
            today in an e-mail to JPMorgan's more than 250,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, increased spending on
            internal controls by about $1 billion this year and dedicated
            more than $750 million 'to address several of our consent
            orders,' Dimon said. At least 5,000 people at the New York-based company have been assigned to compliance,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will pay at least $750 million to close some
            regulatory probes into its record London Whale trading loss last
            year, people familiar with the matter said. That includes about
            $200 million to resolve Securities and Exchange Commission
            claims, a person with knowledge of the matter said today,
            requesting anonymity because the agreement isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has been
            investigating whether the bank manipulated trading in credit
            derivatives, is unlikely to announce a settlement at the same
            time as the other regulators, according to people familiar with
            the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit put its
            Century Park property, a Los Angeles office complex where
            Creative Artists Agency has its headquarters, up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management is marketing the 3.2 million-square-foot (297,000-square-meter)
            Century Park on behalf of
            institutional investors, said Darin Oduyoye, a New York-based
            spokesman for the company. The property, located in the Century
            City business district, may fetch more than $2 billion, said a
            person with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be
            identified because the expected price isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complex has two 44-story towers housing high-end
            offices along with stores and restaurants, as well as a 4-acre
            (1.6-hectare) park and the Annenberg Space for Photography. A
            sale may come by the end of the year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC is the broker marketing the complex,
            Oduyoye said. Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil, didn't
            return a telephone call seeking comment late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) in April planned to market a 21-story
            building at 1888 Century Park East valued at more than $300
            million, two people with knowledge of the effort said at the
            time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management's plans to market Century Park

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is poised to
            pay about $900 million to settle U.S. and U.K. claims that lax
            internal controls led the bank to provide inaccurate information
            about last year's record trading loss to the board, investors
            and regulators, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is set to announce deals today with four
            regulators over its handling of the trades by an employee known
            as the London Whale because his bets were so large, the people
            said, requesting anonymity because talks were private.
            Separately, the firm may also pay less than $80 million to
            settle two watchdogs' probes tied to consumer lending practices,
            two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, whose pay was cut in
            half last year after the board said he was partially responsible
            for faulty oversight of the trades, told employees in a Sept. 17
            memo the bank is making an 'unprecedented effort' to simplify
            its business, overhaul controls and improve relations with
            regulators. The firm has been beset by inquiries this year,
            including the emergence last month of an investigation into its
            hiring practices in Asia as well as criminal probes tied to
            mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The package of penalties to be announced today is a message
            to banks 'that regulators are going to really ratchet up the
            fines if the organization is deemed too big to manage in order
            to get the organization to simplify their structure,' said
            Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $389 Million Over Regulators' Card Add-On Claims</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, is paying $389 million in penalties and
            restitution to settle regulators' claims that it unfairly
            charged customers for credit-monitoring products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank will pay $60 million to the Office
            of the Comptroller of the Currency and $20 million to the
            Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in penalties for improperly
            billing customers for the 'add-on products,' the agencies said
            in a statement today. JPMorgan has already paid $309 million in
            refunds to more than 2.1 million customers, CFPB Director
            Richard Cordray said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Put simply, Chase was charging consumers for services
            they did not receive,' Cordray said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An investigation started by the OCC revealed that JPMorgan
            enrolled customers in credit-monitoring programs that were sold
            as add-ons to credit cards from October 2005 through June 2012,
            the consumer bureau said. The bank began charging customers for
            the programs before obtaining the necessary written
            authorization, the regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010,
            is conducting an industrywide inquiry into various aspects of
            the add-on market, including whether credit-card customers were
            unknowingly enrolled in products such as credit-monitoring
            services and whether banks properly oversaw contractors that
            helped sell them. The probe has yielded settlements with
            companies including Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which agreed to
            pay $210 million in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Wallace, the bank's head of operations for consumer
            and community banking, said in an e-mailed statement that the
            company's Chase Bank unit had stopped new enrollments in the
            products in mid-2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'High Standards' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
            committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
            to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,'
            Wallace said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank still faces a CFPB investigation, disclosed last
            month in a regulatory filing, over credit card debt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier today, the OCC was involved in two other
            settlements with JPMorgan. It was among several regulators in
            the $920 million agreement to settle allegations stemming from
            the bank's London Whale losses. The OCC also ordered the bank
            repay harmed customers and fix problems with its consumer debt-collections practices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asset Management Unit Buying Emerging-Market Securities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $1.5
            trillion asset management unit is buying emerging-market and
            convertible bonds as it seeks higher-yielding securities with
            the Federal Reserve maintaining its stimulus effort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'All asset prices are going to be underwritten by central
            banks for the foreseeable future,' Robert Michele, JPMorgan
            Asset Management's chief investment officer of fixed income and
            currencies, said today on Bloomberg Television's 'Market
            Makers' with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. 'There are
            many parts of the bond market that look attractive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michele said the firm is buying 'equity-like' fixed-income securities, including local
            emerging-market debt, bank
            capital contingent notes and convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are bolstered by the Fed's decision yesterday to
            maintain its $85 billion of monthly Treasury and mortgage-debt
            purchases, surprising economists who expected the central bank
            to start slowing the stimulus program. The greatest proportion
            of fixed-income buyers are more 'overweight' investment-grade
            corporate bonds since February 2011, according to a September
            survey by JPMorgan strategists led by Eric Beinstein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year government note plunged
            16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 2.69 percent
            yesterday, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the
            biggest drop since Oct. 31, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Defensive' Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds in the U.S. are returning 0.4 percent this
            month, paring a 4.3 percent loss in the previous four months as
            concern mounted that the Fed would start slowing its
            unprecedented stimulus effort. U.S. policy makers said yesterday
            they want more evidence of an economic recovery before reducing
            its quantitative-easing program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors had become very defensive over the summer and
            raised a lot of cash,' Michele said. 'You start to sense that
            the market is oversold.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds from developing nations are returning 1.3
            percent this month, the biggest gain since October, according to
            the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Emerging Markets Corporate
            Plus Index, as confidence increases that easy monetary policies
            will keep supporting riskier debt markets. A Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index of convertible notes is returning 4.5
            percent this month, the most since January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Agrees to Repay Customers in Credit-Card Settlement</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to
            repay harmed consumers and fix problems with its handling of
            credit-card debt collections under an agreement with the U.S.
            Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank violated rules regarding
            collections practices, debt documents and sales of consumer
            credit-card debt, the OCC said in a consent order. JPMorgan, the
            biggest U.S. bank by assets, must provide remediation to
            affected customers, improve its documentation procedures with
            non-home loans and review lending accounts since 2005 for
            deficiencies that need to be repaired, the OCC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to the sanctions without admitting or
            denying wrongdoing, according to today's order. The settlement
            was announced at the same time as a separate $920 million
            agreement with multiple regulators over the bank's London Whale
            trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The unsafe or unsound practices identified by the OCC
            were most prevalent in the Bank's consumer and community banking
            lines of business, including credit-card services, auto lending,
            and student lending,' according to the order. The bank's
            employees -- or those of hired third-party firms -- signed
            affidavits that they personally reviewed debt documents that
            'were not based on such personal knowledge or review of the
            relevant books and records.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will review files and submit a plan to the
            regulator on how it intends to repay those harmed. Because the
            plan isn't yet approved, the amount of remediation isn't set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Steps Taken &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have taken extensive steps over the past two years to
            remediate the issues that affected customers and redesign our
            practices,' said Bill Wallace, the bank's head of operations
            for consumer and community banking, in a statement. 'Although
            these issues affected less than 1 percent of Chase customers,
            any mistake is regrettable and does not reflect the high
            standards we set for ourselves.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The problems were discovered by the bank in its own
            internal reviews in 2010, it said in a statement. JPMorgan said
            it stopped filing credit-card collection lawsuits against
            customers in early 2011 and hasn't restarted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau, has also made the debt collection industry a
            top priority this year. His agency, which has been focusing on
            the accuracy of information used to collect debts, is
            investigating JPMorgan's practices, the bank said in a
            Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month. The
            consumer agency may write a regulation to create nationwide
            industry standards, Cordray said on July 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in its SEC filing that it had responded to
            formal and informal inquiries from both federal and state
            regulators on credit-card collections. In May, the bank was sued
            by the California attorney general for violating state laws on
            the use of sworn documents in debt collection and taking illegal
            shortcuts to pursue borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When Citigroup Inc. (C) announced a plan to fire thousands of workers and scale back international
            operations in December 2012, it looked like one more piece of bad news for the big bank, which went on to
            fail its second consecutive U.S. Federal Reserve stress test. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS)
            Inc. analyst Richard Ramsden didn't see it that way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 3, Ramsden lifted his
            rating on the New York'based bank to what Goldman calls a conviction buy, even though the shares were near a
            17-week high and some analysts thought they were poised for a downturn, Bloomberg Markets magazine will
            report in its October issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The strategy we had going into 2013 was to look for
            restructuring stories that we felt were mispriced, and Citigroup was one,' Ramsden says. 'We felt that the
            stronger banks had already done a pretty good job reducing funding costs and expenses and had less room to
            grow earnings.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: The Dumb Money Is Getting Smarter Every Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's
            shares surged 26 percent in the 11 months following his call, beating the Standard Poor's 500 Index.
            Ramsden's confidence in Citi didn't last out the year. On Dec. 3, he cut the rating to a hold and assigned a
            strong buy rating to U.S. Bancorp. (USB) He was right again. Citigroup slipped 8.5 percent through the end

        <headline>Abu Dhabi's Senaat Said to Hire HSBC, JPMorgan for Share Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi holding group Senaat,
            which owns companies including National Petroleum Construction
            Co., hired HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) for a
            share sale, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company appointed the banks as joint book runners for
            an initial public offering this year, the people said, declining
            to be identified because the matter isn't public. Senaat Chief
            Financial Officer Jassem Saleh Busaibe declined to comment, as
            did a spokesman for HSBC. Calls to JPMorgan's media office in
            London outside of office hours weren't immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senaat is among United Arab Emirates' companies planning
            share sales after stock values surged. Abu Dhabi's benchmark ADX
            General Index gained 45 percent this year, while the government
            forecasts average economic growth of 4.6 percent between 2012
            and 2015, more than twice as fast as the previous four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senaat, which also owns Emirates Steel Industries PJSC,
            posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to 12.3 billion dirhams ($3.3
            billion) in 2012, while assets rose 8 percent to 25.4 billion
            dirhams, according to a statement on the company's website.
            Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
            rose 8 percent to 2.3 billion dirhams in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Just Falafel, the U.A.E. fast-food chain, is weighing the
            sale of a 25 percent stake in an initial public offering, two
            people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Gulf
            Capital, the Abu Dhabi-based private equity firm, hired
            Rothschild to advise on a share sale of its Gulf Marine unit,
            while private equity firm Abraaj Group is planning an IPO of its
            Stanford Marine Group unit in London. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Mortgage-Unit Garry Cipponeri Said to Leave Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Garry Cipponeri, the head of
            capital markets for JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s U.S. mortgage unit,
            is leaving the bank to start a new company, according to two
            people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cipponeri, a senior vice president who joined JPMorgan in
            2004 from Citigroup Inc., is planning to start a firm called
            TradeRoom Capital Partners that will trade mortgages that
            haven't been packaged into bonds and do consulting, said the
            people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn't
            been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He declined to comment when reached by telephone, as did
            Jason Lobo, a spokesman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the second-largest U.S. home lender after Wells
            Fargo Co., according to newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.
            Cipponeri often represented the bank during panels at industry
            events, such as a Mortgage Bankers Association conference in New
            York in May and a workshop sponsored by the Federal Reserve
            Banks of Boston and New York in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mercuria Unit to Be Regulated by FCA as JPMorgan Deal Nears</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. said one
            of its trading units fell under the U.K.'s Financial Conduct
            Authority for the first time as it seeks to expand services in
            European financial commodity markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Europe Trading Ltd. is authorized and regulated by
            the FCA under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the
            Geneva-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria, nearing completion of a $3.5 billion deal to buy
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s physical commodity operation, joins
            Glencore Plc and Trafigura Beheer BV in having part of its
            business regulated by the FCA. After decades of operating in
            relative secrecy, the acquisition of physical assets is pushing
            independent commodity traders to increase disclosure as they
            seek new sources of financing, including bond sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As Mercuria's business model continues to evolve to
            expand its provision of services, so too does the regulatory
            oversight of Mercuria,' Victoria Attwood Scott, the firm's head
            of compliance, said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Attwood Scott, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive,
            said in April that Mercuria was in discussions with the FCA to
            determine whether the purchase of JPMorgan's European gas and
            power operations would require regulatory oversight by the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growing Fast &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded a decade ago by former Goldman Sachs traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, Mercuria is
            growing faster than
            Trafigura, Gunvor Group Ltd. and Vitol Group, the world's
            largest oil trader. As investment banks such as JPMorgan pull
            back from physical commodities because of rising regulatory
            scrutiny, Mercuria is seeking to combine such operations with
            investment bank-style commodity futures and options trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria's FCA application isn't the first by a foreign-based commodity trading firm. A unit of
            Baar, Switzerland-based
            Glencore Plc (GLEN) is regulated by the FCA as is the Galena Asset
            Management Ltd. hedge fund arm of Amsterdam's Trafigura, and
            energy and metals trading firms related to Wichita, Kansas-based
            Koch Industries Inc, according to the FCA website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA in February issued its first report on commodity-market regulation in the U.K. since 2007.
            The study raised
            concerns about the increasing role in global markets played by
            commodity trading houses and the ability to adequately regulate
            them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Non-governmental organizations like Switzerland's Berne
            Declaration have said there is a gap in regulatory oversight in
            relation to traders like Mercuria, which recorded revenue of
            $112 billion in 2013. The firm and other traders have said their
            businesses are already subject to regulation through exchange-traded options trading and oversight of their
            banking partners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mercuria has always been subject to regulations and
            oversight across the globe in all of its activities and takes
            these responsibilities very seriously,' Attwood Scott said in
            the statement. 'As such, Mercuria views this development as an
            extension of its existing obligations and regulatory
            relationships as we broaden the scope of our business.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects second paragraph to show Canada, Germany and
            Children's Investment Fund Foundation are among those
            contributing the $94 million.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and the Bill
            Melinda Gates Foundation formed an investment fund that will
            back late-stage development of technologies to fight killer
            diseases in low-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A group of investors including the Canadian and German
            governments and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation
            committed $94 million to the fund. The International Finance
            Corp., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Merck Co. (MRK), Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s
            foundation, Storebrand ASA (STB) and JPMorgan Chase also invested. The
            Global Health Investment Fund will tackle diseases including
            malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, as well as maternal and infant
            mortality, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The private financing seeks to address the fact that global
            health funding barely grew last year. The U.S. and other
            governments cut their aid to programs in developing nations by
            4.4 percent, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and
            Evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Global Health Investment Fund demonstrates the
            potential for innovative collaborations and thoughtful financial
            structures to mobilize new sources of capital for social
            challenges,' said Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive
            officer of JPMorgan Chase. 'This product brings a diverse group
            of investors together around the shared objective of developing
            life-saving technologies in a financially sustainable way.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given the risks of investing in the clinical development of
            new technologies, the Gates Foundation and the Swedish
            International Development Cooperation Agency will partially
            offset potential losses in the fund, which will seek a financial
            return for investors by targeting technologies with public
            health applications in both developed and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lion's Head Global Partners LLP, a London-based asset
            manager specializing in sustainable development, will be
            responsible for originating, managing and exiting the fund's
            portfolio investments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset-management business hired Gareth Haslip to lead U.K. strategy
            for a group that advises insurance clients on investments and
            oversees more than $90 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Haslip previously was a director at Aon Benfield Securities
            and Aon Hewitt's Insurance Asset Solutions, units of broker Aon
            Plc (AON), according to a statement today from New York-based
            JPMorgan. Prior to that, he worked in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
            asset-management business, focusing on insurance clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gareth's extensive experience of advising insurance
            companies on their investments will further strengthen our
            capabilities and deep working relationships with insurance
            companies in the U.K.,' Douglas Niemann, head of strategy and
            analytics for JPMorgan Asset Management's global insurance
            solutions team, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is adding staff as it vies with Goldman Sachs,
            BlackRock Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG for fee income from managing
            institutional client money. Insurance companies have outsourced
            oversight of some investment duties as they shift strategies
            amid new regulation and low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In June, JPMorgan said it hired Prashant Sharma from
            Goldman Sachs to head international fixed-income investments for
            insurance clients. Niemann joined the team in 2012 from insurer
            American International Group Inc. (AIG) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs announced the hiring of
            Neil Moge from JPMorgan to lead a London-based team overseeing
            insurer client money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Haslip holds a Ph.D. in actuarial science with a focus on
            derivative pricing from Cass Business School in London,
            according to the statement. David Prosperi, a spokesman for
            London-based Aon, declined to comment on the departure. &lt;/p&gt;

            its business in Turkey and Azerbaijan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bagriacik, who has run the German lender's investment
            banking operations in Turkey since 2009, will start his new role
            as senior country officer for the two nations on Oct. 1, the New
            York-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. He will replace
            Emre Derman who left the bank earlier this year, according to a
            spokeswoman for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment banking activity in the nation is recovering as
            mergers and acquisitions pick up after two elections wins by the
            ruling AK Party. Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604), Japan's largest
            brokerage, said in March it had received a license to open a
            representative office in Turkey. In March, Finance Minister
            Mehmet Simsek said that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was applying to
            the regulator to open a representative office in Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Bank of Greece SA has hired banks including
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to sell as much as 40 percent of
            Turkish unit Finansbank AS (FINBN) in a secondary share offering, four
            people familiar with the matter said Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
            told government negotiators working on a possible settlement
            with JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) that the company's initial proposal
            fell far short of an acceptable payment amount, according to a
            person with knowledge of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the early stages of the negotiations this week, the
            company was proposing a settlement of between $3 billion and $4
            billion, a separate person with knowledge of the negotiations
            said. Those numbers were rejected by the government, said the
            person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Subsequent proposals have reached higher dollar amounts,
            according to the person, who said that the numbers, as well as
            how the settlement money may be disbursed, are still subject to

            equity derivatives structuring in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alberici, who works on structured notes that the bank
            creates for sale to retail investors, started at JPMorgan this
            month, said Justin Perras, a company spokesman. He reports to

            &lt;p&gt;Alberici declined to comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;

            since July 2000, according to online records of the Financial
            Industry Regulatory Authority. Bank of America bought Merrill
            Lynch in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move was originally reported by

            that lost almost $2 billion during Chrysler Group LLC's 2009
            bankruptcy, is now its chief adviser as the automaker's two
            owners haggle over its value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will advise Chrysler in the event of its sale to
            majority shareholder, Fiat SpA, said people with knowledge of
            the matter who asked not to be identified because the
            information is private. The bank was also listed this week as
            the lead underwriter of an initial public offering of Chrysler
            shares owned by the company's other shareholder, a United Auto
            Workers retiree trust. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dual role highlights the complicated path Chrysler has
            been forced to take to resolve a dispute between its two
            backers. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive officer of both
            Chrysler and Fiat who has spent four years seeking to merge the
            companies, is at loggerheads with the UAW's trust over the value
            of its 41.5 percent stake in Chrysler. Letting public investors
            put a price on the stake, through the IPO process, is one way to
            resolve the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'From a banker's viewpoint, more transactions are
            preferred to less,' said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at
            the University of Florida. 'In either an IPO or a merger, the
            acquisition of the remaining stake offers opportunities to
            collect fees.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to HSBC Stall EU Euribor Case Amid Bias Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings
            Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) delayed by months the European
            Union's investigation into Euribor rigging amid scrutiny of
            possible EU bias, according to three people familiar with the
            case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trio gained more time to respond to the EU's May
            antitrust complaint after demanding to see files necessary for
            their defense, said the people who asked not to be named because
            the issue is private. These requests have been taken more
            seriously since the EU's ombudsman started inquiring into Credit
            Agricole's bias allegations, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The European Commission doesn't want to appear to have
            been too tough on Credit Agricole,' Adrien Giraud, a lawyer at
            Willkie Farr Gallagher LLP, said. 'That might explain why
            they were more lenient on deadlines than usually.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Euribor-rigging investigation has been strained since
            the three refused to join four other lenders including Deutsche
            Bank AG (DBK) and Societe Generale SA (GLE) who paid a total of 1 billion
            euros ($1.3 billion) to settle the case. The delays -- including
            the latest scrapping of a mid-September deadline for responses -
            - robbed Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, of the
            chance to impose another set of fines on the finance industry as
            he prepares to leave office at the end of next month, the people
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives for the commission, JPMorgan, HSBC and
            Credit Agricole all declined to comment on the Euribor
            investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Failed Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia said this month that time has run out in his two-year long quest to clinch an antitrust
            settlement with Google
            Inc. (GOOG) He's also conceded that he won't have time to complete an
            antitrust probe into credit derivatives trading by 13 of the
            world's biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's clear that Almunia has accepted that he won't be
            able to finalize several cases' and Euribor 'is just one more
            on his list,' Giraud said. 'The officials working on the case
            aren't therefore in as much of a hurry.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU ombudsman, the internal EU watchdog, opened a case
            on July 31 after Credit Agricole complained that public comments
            made by Almunia indicated he had already made up his mind about
            the conclusion of the Euribor investigation, Bloomberg News
            reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia's stance explains the banks' determination to try
            to delay the case until after his departure, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fairness and Transparency' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His successor, former Danish Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager, is scheduled to take over the EU
            antitrust brief and
            deal with the EU ombudsman's inquiry at the start of November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vestager said this month that all cases should be 'treated
            with fairness and transparency.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aside from examining Euribor, Vestager will inherit a
            preliminary probe into suspected rigging of foreign-exchange
            markets, which is part of a global scandal that tarnished the
            reputation of some of the world's biggest lenders. Oil
            benchmarks are also under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole were accused on May 20
            by the commission of colluding to rig Euribor rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The so-called statement of objections was the next step in
            the EU enforcement process after the banks dropped out of
            settlement talks last year. The EU procedure allows them to
            respond to the complaint in writing and request a hearing. If
            companies fail to deflect accusations in antitrust cases they
            are then usually fined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, and Libor, the
            London Interbank Offered Rate, gauge banks' estimated cost of
            borrowing over different periods of time. Libor alone is the
            benchmark interest rate for more than $300 trillion of
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banks Prejudged &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole haven't yet been
            found liable, the December settlements spell out their role in
            helping to manipulate Euribor, said another person familiar with
            the confidential EU documents. This suggested the EU had
            prejudged the three banks before they were given their full due-process rights, said the person who is
            familiar with the
            reasoning of a settling bank and raised the issue with the
            commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission shouldn't make 'any allusion to the
            liability' of companies in a final decision -- such as the
            December Euribor settlements -- before the firms are given a
            chance to fend off charges, according to EU case law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The companies could argue their case has been decided
            before they had the chance to defend themselves,' said Alfonso
            Lamadrid, a lawyer at Garrigues in Brussels who's not involved
            in the case. This would give them 'new procedural ammunition to
            challenge an eventual sanction' in court. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Citigroup Lose Bid to Throw Out FDIC Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
            Inc. (C) were among the banks that lost a bid to throw out a Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corp. lawsuit over $388 million in securities
            sold to a failed lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan today denied
            a motion to dismiss the suit, which also targets UBS AG (UBSN),
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) Stanton rejected defense
            arguments that FDIC filed the suit too late and that the agency
            failed to make a sufficient claim that could allow it to
            recover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the suit, filed last year, FDIC alleged that the banks
            misrepresented the quality of the loans underlying 11
            residential mortgage-backed securities that Colonial Bank
            purchased in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colonial Bank, of Montgomery, Alabama, was closed by the
            Alabama State Banking Department on Aug. 14, 2009, and the FDIC
            was named as a receiver for the institution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The misrepresentations included inaccurate loan-to-value
            ratios based on inflated property values, according to the
            complaint. Many of the properties at issue also had second
            mortgages that weren't disclosed, the FDIC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In many cases, the amount of the undisclosed additional
            liens was much greater than the owners' ostensible equity,
            putting the owner 'under water' on the day on which this
            securitization closed,' the FDIC said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for
            Colonial Bank v. Chase Mortgage Finance Corp, 12-cv-6166, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Nomura Selling Notes Linked to Peripheral Banks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of structured notes tied to
            the creditworthiness of banks in the euro region's periphery are
            the highest in six months as investors gain confidence lenders
            will benefit from the region's improving economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) led issuance
            of $42.3 million of the securities in September, the most since
            $167.2 million in March, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The notes are tied to the debt of lenders including
            Spain's Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP), Banco BPI SA of Portugal and
            UniCredit SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro area's economy emerged from its longest-ever
            recession in the second quarter and European Central Bank
            President Mario Draghi said this week he's ready to use another
            longer-term refinancing operation if needed to curb market
            rates. Bank credit risk is improving, with investors demanding
            102 basis points of extra yield to hold their debt instead of
            government bonds, down from 179 a year earlier, according to
            Bloomberg bond index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Peripheral banks have been beaten up over the past few
            years, but there is growing investor comfort with them and more
            willingness to take on that exposure, especially in Spain where
            the restructuring of balance sheets has been extensive and
            visible,' said Steve Hussey, head of financial institutions
            credit research at AllianceBernstein Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Spanish Lenders &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish banks took more than 200 billion euros ($270.6
            billion) of impairments between June 2008 and December 2012 amid
            the collapse of a decade-long property boom that sent home
            prices plunging and burdened banks with more bad loans,
            according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. The country's
            lenders, which have received 129 billion euros of capital
            injections since the end of 2007, are in a strong position to
            pass an ECB asset quality review next year, BBVA's chief
            financial officer Manuel Gonzalez Cid, said Sept. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan issued the first credit-linked notes tied to
            Portugal's Banco BPI since at least 1999, Bloomberg data show.
            The largest U.S. bank by assets raised $19.8 million from two
            offerings that pay 4.7 percentage points and 4.8 percentage
            points more than the three-month euro interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura sold $5.5 million of 15-year callable notes tied to
            UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, with coupons of 9.1 percent
            this month, as well as 2.28 million euros of 5.26 percent
            securities linked to Banco Popolare SC. Italian banks' gross
            non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending rose to
            7.2 percent in July from 5.7 percent a year earlier, according
            to the Italian Banking Association ABI. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Craig MacDonald, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
            declined to comment on the notes, while Nomura spokesman Rob
            Davies was unable to comment immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Interest in peripheral banks is emblematic of the risk-on
            environment, with investors looking to take advantage of wider
            credit spreads on offer in countries like Spain and Italy' said
            Michael Symonds, a credit analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets in
            London. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Citigroup Follows JPMorgan as Legal Target, Peabody Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) is poised to be the
            next U.S. bank to attract legal and regulatory scrutiny as
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) looks to settle a host of probes, according
            to an analyst at Portales Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup's $5 billion estimate of potential legal costs
            that weren't covered by reserves at midyear is second only to
            JPMorgan, Charles Peabody of Portales said yesterday in a
            Bloomberg Radio interview. That shows Citigroup may be bracing
            for more legal challenges, Peabody said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's very conceivable that Citigroup will be next in the
            firing line,' Peabody said. 'Their litigation costs have been
            accelerating faster than anyone else's.' Citigroup is the
            third-largest U.S. bank by assets and JPMorgan is ranked first.
            Both are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this month
            that announcements about banks other than JPMorgan would be made
            in the coming weeks and months. Citigroup Chief Executive
            Officer Michael Corbat has seen litigation costs climb to $1.44
            billion in the first half of 2013, putting this year on track to
            be the most expensive for such costs since the financial crisis,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mark Costiglio, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
            The lender is facing 'legacy issues' tied to mortgage
            products, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in July. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>McCain Pressures Justice to Hold JPMorgan Executives Accountable</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator John McCain pressured
            the Justice Department to hold JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) executives
            individually accountable while they work to settle claims that
            the bank packaged and sold bad mortgage bonds to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Will you seek to hold any top officer, director or key
            employees within JPMorgan personally accountable for the
            wrongdoing?' McCain, of Arizona, wrote in a letter today to
            Attorney General Eric Holder. McCain, the ranking Republican on
            a Senate subcommittee that probed JPMorgan's record trading loss
            last year, criticized Holder's Sept. 26 meeting with Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, calling it 'highly unusual.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender is in talks to pay about $11 billion to end
            investigations by state and federal authorities into its
            mortgage-bond sales practices, according to people familiar with
            the talks, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are
            private. The discussions are fluid and the size of the
            settlement keeps changing, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McCain asked Holder whether the settlement being discussed
            will preclude civil or criminal actions against JPMorgan
            executives and whether the structure of the deal will allow the
            New York-based bank to receive tax breaks on fines or penalties
            it may pay, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;

            U.S. Senator John McCain, the ranking Republican on a Senate subcommittee that probed JPMorgan Chase Co.'s
            record trading loss last year, criticized Attorney General Eric Holder's Sept. 26 meeting with Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, calling it 'highly unusual.' Close

        <headline>JPMorgan Fund Joins Tax Lawsuits Seen Costing U.K. $1.6 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. tax officials may have to pay
            out 1 billion pounds ($1.62 billion) to about 100 investment
            funds -- including some run by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Royal
            Bank of Scotland Group Plc -- suing for the return of overpaid
            taxes dating back two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her Majesty's Revenue Customs won't disclose what it may
            owe the funds in lawsuits stemming from a 2007 European Court
            ruling that investment trusts were improperly charged value-added tax on management fees. Marc Welby, a
            partner at
            accounting firm BDO LLP estimated the agency might have to
            refund about 1 billion pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The litigation 'is about investment trusts who feel short-changed over the way in which HMRC
            handled claims,' said Welby,
            a London tax specialist who isn't involved in the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmakers have publicly censured companies including
            Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for using legal loopholes to
            minimize taxes. At the same time, the agency in charge of
            collecting them is fighting in the courts to avoid refunds that
            could cost the government billions of pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 120 investment trusts, including others operated by
            BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Schroders Plc (SDR) and Investec Plc, have sued HMRC
            since May 2012, according to court filings that didn't show the
            reason for the suits. Two people familiar with the actions said
            at least 100 of them are related to overpaid VAT. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Loses Ruling on Class Certification in RMBS Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) lost a bid to
            block buyers of $10 billion worth of residential mortgage-backed
            securities it packaged in 2007 to proceed as a group with their
            lawsuit alleging the bank misled them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan today ruled
            that the claims of investors in nine separate offerings of the
            securities were similar enough for them to move forward as a
            class on the question of whether JPMorgan is liable for making
            false and misleading statements in the offering documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling only applies to liability. Oetken said he wasn't
            convinced at this stage that there's a damages calculation that
            would cover the claims of all the investors included in the
            group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last year agreed to a $13 billion settlement with
            the U.S. to resolve allegations the bank misled investors in
            mortgage-backed securities about the soundness and risks of the
            investments that helped bring on subprime-mortgage crisis of
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because the class is currently certified for liability
            purposes, this phase of litigation will focus on the issue of
            whether defendants made material false statements or omissions
            in the offering documents that affected the value of the
            certificates owned by the plaintiff class members,' the judge
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on today's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Class certification will allow individual investors who
            haven't filed a lawsuit to be represented by the lead plaintiff
            in a single case because their experiences and legal claims are
            similar. Class-action status is less expensive for plaintiffs
            than filing multiple lawsuits and provides leverage in
            settlement negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund v. J.P.
            Morgan Chase Co., 09-cv-3701, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
