        <headline>Moody's Review of Bailouts May Dent Banks, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A reduction in Moody's Investors
            Service's estimate of how much taxpayer support financial firms
            will receive in a crisis may result in credit ratings cuts for
            banks from Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
            according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moody's, which placed 'negative outlooks' on the holding
            company ratings of eight systemically important U.S. lenders in
            June, said last week that it expects to update its 'bank
            holding company support assumptions' by year-end. The firms'
            grades are as many as two levels higher because of the potential
            of a public backstop, according to Moody's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our base case assumption is that there will be a one
            notch reduction across the board,' JPMorgan analysts led by
            Kabir Caprihan said today in a report. 'We also see the
            potential for future upgrades in the standalone credit ratings
            for Bank of America and Citigroup,' the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks included in the Moody's review are Bank of New
            York Mellon Corp., State Street Corp., Wells Fargo, JPMorgan,
            Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of
            America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has made progress
            toward reducing the likelihood of future government support as
            the agency identifies obstacles to implement its so-called
            orderly liquidation authority, which gives the FDIC power to
            wind down, split up or sell off companies considered a potential
            systemic risk to U.S. financial stability, Moody's said in a
            March 27 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banks, Industrials &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our base case assumes that Moody's will remove some of
            the support from all or some of the holding companies under
            review, but will not completely remove the ratings uplift from
            support across the board,' the JPMorgan analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in the $5.2 trillion U.S. corporate bond market
            are wagering banks are safer relative to industrial companies
            even after Moody's cut the ratings of 15 of the world's largest
            banks in June, citing fragile confidence and tighter regulations
            that pinched revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders are poised to overtake industrial companies as the
            safest borrowers for the first time since the start of the worst
            financial crisis since the Great Depression, with investors
            demanding an extra 156 basis points in yield over benchmarks to
            buy bonds of banks, compared with 146 basis points for companies
            from Alcoa Inc. to Ford Motor Co., Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At 10 basis points, the gap has shrunk from a peak of 365
            in March 2009 and may invert as soon as this year based on the
            current pace of tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank bonds were seen as safer than industrial debt by
            investors until September 2007, the month after BNP Paribas SA
            marked the start of the credit seizure by halting withdrawals
            from investment funds that owned subprime mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Invest in Junk Bonds for New Reinsurer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will manage
            funds for a Bermuda-based reinsurer that raised $1.13 billion in
            capital, concentrating the investments in junk bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Highbridge Principal Strategies LLC will oversee
            the assets for Watford Re Ltd., the reinsurer said yesterday in
            a statement. Watford said it raised $907 million in common
            equity, including a $100 million investment by Arch Capital
            Group Ltd., and $226 million in preferred shares. The reinsurer
            is targeting an initial public offering in two to three years,
            Chief Executive Officer John Rathgeber said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reinsurer's portfolio will be 'comprised primarily of
            non-investment grade credit assets, which it believes will
            generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders
            over the long term,' Watford said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money managers including Dan Loeb have started Bermuda-based reinsurers in recent years to raise
            funds that are less
            subject to client withdrawals and can provide tax advantages.
            Pine River Capital Management LP, the hedge-fund firm founded by
            Brian Taylor, was seeking to raise $500 million to $750 million
            for a reinsurance company, a person familiar with the matter
            said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, owns Highbridge
            through its investment arm, JPMorgan Asset Management.
            Highbridge Principal Strategies is led by Chief Executive
            Officer Scott Kapnick, who came to the firm in 2007 after 21
            years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was global co-head
            of investment banking. HPS had about $19 billion of assets under
            management as of March, Watford said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Casualty Coverage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rathgeber was vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance
            Group. Jon Levy was named chief risk officer and Roderick Romeo
            will be chief financial officer. Reinsurers shoulder risk for
            primary carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Management is aiming for annualized returns of about 15
            percent over time, Rathgeber said. He plans to focus on casualty
            lines such as automobile liability, workers' compensation and
            medical malpractice coverage while limiting risks tied to
            natural disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It wouldn't make sense to have this kind of investment
            strategy and be heavily into that kind of volatile, capital-intensive reinsurance exposure,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Constantine Iordanou, the CEO of Bermuda-based Arch
            Capital, has been diversifying risk through deals including an
            agreement last year to add assets from bankrupt mortgage insurer
            PMI Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arch slipped 0.8 percent to $57.07 at 10:17 a.m. in New
            York, narrowing its gain to about 8.6 percent over the past
            year. JPMorgan climbed 0.3 percent and is up 27 percent in the
            past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Junk-rated corporate debt worldwide returned 2.9 percent
            since Dec. 31, beating global stocks and setting the stage for a
            sixth year of gains, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            index data. The bonds now yield 6.1 percent, compared with an
            average of about 10 percent in the decade through 2007. Junk
            bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt rated below BBB-by Standard
            Poor's and lower than Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe that non-investment-grade credit complements
            Watford's reinsurance strategy,' Purnima Puri, HPS's managing
            director, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan advised on the capital structuring,
            and Clifford Chance LLP was Watford's outside counsel. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Exploits 15-Year Ban With De Facto Munis: Brazil Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Credit
            Suisse Group AG (CSGN) are finding ways to profit from Brazil's 15-year
            ban on municipal bond sales, issuing notes tied to state loans
            guaranteed by the government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks last month sold notes backed by a $1.27 billion
            loan to the state of Minas Gerais yielding 4.216 percent. While
            the securities were sold at a lower rate than the 5.33 percent
            that Credit Suisse charged Minas Gerais in November and let the
            state pay back a portion of the principal along with interest
            payments, they yield 1.3 times more than similar-maturity
            government bonds and carry the same guarantee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street's biggest banks are capitalizing on Brazil's
            decision in August to ease some restrictions on state borrowing
            put in place after a $44 billion federal bailout in 1997 by
            securitizing the loans they extend as local governments seek to
            refinance bailout debt and fund investments. With virtually no
            outstanding muni bonds in Brazil, the Minas Gerais notes have
            risen 0.32 cent since they were issued at a premium of 109.18
            cents on the dollar, according to Cantor Fitzgerald. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's clear that the market likes it,' Ulisses de Oliveira, a money manager at Galloway Capital
            Management in Sao
            Paulo who helps oversee $400 million of emerging-market debt,
            said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

            repay debt owed to the state-owned electric utility, according to state Finance Secretary Luiz Carlos Hauly.

        <headline>Blythe Masters Ends 27-Year Run at JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, who rose from being a JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) intern to global head of a
            commodities powerhouse over 27 years, plans to exit after she helps the bank complete the $3.5 billion sale
            of units she oversees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Masters, 45, 'has informed us of her intention to leave the firm,
            take some well-deserved time off and consider future opportunities,' Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
            58, and investment-banking head Daniel Pinto, 51, said today in a memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            announced the sale of its physical commodities business to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. last month amid
            pressure from regulators and lawmakers concerned that banks handling raw materials and energy could
            manipulate prices or endanger the financial system. That raised the question of whether Masters would join
            Mercuria, a decade old Geneva-based trader, or remain at JPMorgan to manage a diminished business. She chose
            neither. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There was little reason for her to stay at JPMorgan given that her baby is
            being sold from underneath her,' said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York. 'I'm
            not shocked she didn't end up at Mercuria because they have a senior group that is probably tightknit, and
            she would've been a substantial person to try and integrate.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former JPMorgan and UBS Bankers Plan to Start London Hedge Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) former global
            head of equity finance and three other bankers have started a
            London hedge-fund firm, as they try to profit from Europe's
            economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrea Angelone, who spent 20 years at JPMorgan, and Amit Jain, previously an equity derivatives
            trader for the New York-based bank, both left last year to start a hedge fund with
            Simone Russo, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. managing
            director, and Guido Miani, previously a fixed-income trader at
            UBS AG. The firm, Amagis Capital Ltd., will invest in companies
            pursuing acquisitions, share buybacks and other transactions,
            hoping to benefit from an increase in corporate activity as
            Europe's sovereign debt-crisis fades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is an opportunity right now in the European market
            to deliver superior returns because of recovering activity,'
            Angelone, Amagis' chief executive offer, said in an interview.
            'After many years on the sell side we have the experience and
            knowledge to be able to deploy a slightly different approach in
            the event-driven space.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A growing number of traders have left banks for hedge funds
            since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008
            prompted regulators to try to limit risk-taking by lenders.
            Banks including JPMorgan shut proprietary trading desks after
            the U.S. Congress approved the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, which
            restricts lenders from using their own capital to make bets on
            stocks and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a gap that we can capitalize on' with banks
            moving away from proprietary trading, Angelone said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amagis will begin trading May 1 with $35 million from six
            investors, Angelone said. The firm, which plans to open an
            office in Monaco, seeks to manage $100 million by the end of
            2014 and $500 million in three years., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deepak Gulati, a former head of global equity proprietary
            trading at JPMorgan, begin investing at his hedge-fund firm last
            June after raising about $300 million. Argentiere Capital AG,
            based in Zug, Switzerland, focuses on volatility trades, betting
            on the rate at which stocks rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Avolon Said to Hire Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan for Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Avolon Aerospace Leasing Ltd., the
            private-equity backed aircraft financing company, has hired
            JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley to explore a possible
            initial public offering or sale, according to people familiar
            with its plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avolon, owned by Oak Hill Capital Partners LP, Cinven Ltd.,
            and CVC Capital Partners Ltd., may seek a U.S. listing should it
            opt for an IPO, said one of the people, who asked not to be
            named because the discussions are private. The company, with the
            youngest fleet of any large aircraft lessor and 198 planes in
            its portfolio and on order, also counts Singapore's sovereign
            wealth fund among its investors, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avolon Chief Executive Officer Domhnal Slattery said last
            year he was encouraged by transactions including Sumitomo Mitsui
            Financial Group Inc.'s $7.3 billion purchase of Royal Bank of
            Scotland Group Plc's aviation unit and that he would explore
            strategic options as early as 2014. Companies in Europe have
            raised about $17 billion in IPOs this year, more than triple
            what they did a year earlier in the same period, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives for Avolon, based in Dublin, Oak Hill,
            Cinven, CVC, Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growing Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Airfinance Journal reported earlier today that Avolon and
            lessor Awas Aviation Capital Ltd. are exploring options for a
            sale, with Awas hiring Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc. It didn't identify bankers hired by Avolon to explore
            options. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Airlines buying large commercial aircraft will require $100
            billion in financing this year, according to Avolon estimates.
            Lessors make up about 40 percent of the aircraft financing
            market now, a figure that is set to rise in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To support growth, the companies rely increasingly on
            external funding, including capital markets, and transactions
            including lessors have picked up. In December, AerCap Holdings
            NV (AER) agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp. from American
            International Group Inc. for $15 billion to create a lessor

            &lt;p&gt;Avolon has raised $7.2 billion in capital since its launch,
            with its four owners putting in $1.4 billion in equity
            investments. Its most recent financing closed last month, when
            it secured a $500 million debt facility to finance aircraft
            purchases this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mubadala Development Co., Abu Dhabi's investment and
            development company, is considering an initial public offering

            with knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other lessor transactions in the last 24 months include the
            purchase of Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)'s Jackson Square Aviation

        <headline>JPMorgan Wins Round in Dexia SA Mortgage-Bond Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, defeated most of a lawsuit brought by Dexia SA over
            about $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed securities it bought
            before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan narrowed the
            case to five securitization deals from 65 at issue in a
            complaint brought by Dexia, according to an order filed today.
            Rakoff said he would issue an opinion later explaining his
            reasoning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dexia, based in Brussels, sued JPMorgan in 2012 along with
            the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual businesses JPMorgan
            acquired, accusing the lender of 'egregious fraud' in the sale
            of mortgage bonds. Dexia claimed loans backing securities
            purchased between 2005 and 2007 were riskier than promised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dexia (DEXB) unit FSA Asset Management LLC said in court papers
            that JPMorgan received reports from independent mortgage-loan
            underwriters showing that 20 percent to 80 percent of the loans
            in samples used for testing didn't meet the underwriting
            guidelines, including fraudulent home appraisals or missing
            documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Rather than disclose these known defects to FSAM,
            defendants bought and sold massive quantities of defective
            loans,' FSAM said. 'Defendants secretly overrode the
            independent loan underwriters' determinations, creating a final,
            sanitized version.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rakoff granted part of JPMorgan's motion for a pre-trial
            ruling known as summary judgment. The judge dismissed claims
            brought by Dexia and said FSAM can pursue claims related to five
            securitizations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, didn't immediately comment about the decision. A
            lawyer for Dexia couldn't be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns Co., 12-cv-04761.
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells 401(k) Recordkeeping to Great-West Lifeco</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. lender, agreed to sell its large-market 401(k)
            recordkeeping business to a division of Canadian life insurer
            Great-West Lifeco (GWO) Inc. Terms of the transaction weren't
            disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal will make Great-West the second-largest
            recordkeeper of 401(k)-type retirement plans by participants,
            serving 6.8 million workers with a combined $387 billion in
            assets, the company said today in a statement from Winnipeg,
            Canada. The largest provider of retirement recordkeeping
            services, which include sending out account statements and other
            communications to participants, is Boston-based Fidelity
            Investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose recordkeeping business lags behind those of
            firms such as Fidelity, Vanguard Group Inc. and Prudential
            Financial Inc., is selling its unit as recordkeeping for
            workers' retirement accounts has become less lucrative for firms
            that don't have scale. The deal will catapult Great-West from
            the seventh-largest recordkeeper of 401(k)-type plans by assets
            in 2012, according to research firm Cerulli Associates, allowing
            it to compete with the biggest firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bringing together these platforms allows us to be a
            market leader,' said Robert Reynolds, who was named last month
            as president and chief executive officer of Great-West Lifeco
            U.S., which owns Great-West Financial and Putnam Investments.
            'You can make money in this business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Top Priorities' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale is a shift for New York-based JPMorgan, whose head
            of retirement, Michael Falcon, said in March 2011 that getting a
            bigger share of retirement assets was 'one of the top
            priorities' at the bank. JPMorgan at the time had roughly
            doubled its sales force dedicated to retirement plans including
            pitches for its recordkeeping services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's not easy to see anything like this,' Falcon, head
            of retirement at JPMorgan's asset-management unit, said in an
            interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will continue to sell investments to retirement
            plans, Falcon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a large and growing business on the investment
            side,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Americans held $23 trillion in retirement assets as of Dec.
            31, of which $4.2 trillion was in 401(k) plans. Administrators
            of 401(k)s are paid for their recordkeeping service also may
            make money from investments in the plan if they are managed by
            their own firm or through arrangements with other money managers
            known as revenue-sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cross-Selling &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many recordkeepers also see the administration of 401(k)
            accounts as an avenue for cross-selling other products to
            workers such as individual retirement accounts when they retire
            or change jobs. Those accounts usually have higher fees,
            according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability
            Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proliferation of lower-fee products and more cost-conscious employers have contributed to
            declining expenses for
            401(k) investments over the past 15 years, data compiled by the
            Washington-based Investment Company Institute show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to close during the third
            quarter of this year pending regulatory approval. More than
            1,000 employees of JPMorgan's retirement-services unit will move
            to Great-West. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal won't 'have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase's
            earnings, according to the bank's statement. The two companies
            said workers with accounts administered by JPMorgan should
            expect no disruption. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Unblocks Russian Payment to Sanctioned Bank's Affiliate</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is unfreezing a
            money transfer from a Russian embassy in Central Asia to an
            insurer linked to U.S.-sanctioned bank after getting a go-ahead
            from regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Following consultation with our regulators, we are
            processing this transaction,' JPMorgan said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reversal comes two days after Russia's Foreign Ministry
            decried the move by the biggest U.S. bank blocking a payment
            from its embassy in Astana, Kazakhstan, to Sogaz Insurance Group
            as 'illegal and absurd.' Sogaz is part-owned by OAO Bank
            Rossiya, a St. Petersburg-based lender under U.S. sanctions
            relating to the Ukraine crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama announced the action against
            Bank Rossiya last month as part of a broadening of sanctions
            that targeted government officials and allies of Russian
            President Vladimir Putin, whose associates own Bank Rossiya. The
            embassy's transaction was for less than $5,000, a person with
            knowledge of the dispute said, asking not to be identified
            because such transfers aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry said 'the hostile action' by
            JPMorgan bank was 'a grossest violation of international law,'
            according to its April 1 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Bank Rossiya unit reduced its stake in Sogaz to 48.5
            percent from 51 percent on March 11, according to a regulatory
            disclosure on the insurer's website. The U.S. added Bank Rossiya
            and its billionaire shareholder Yury Kovalchuk to an extended
            sanctions list on March 20 following Russia's annexation of
            Crimea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's Finance Ministry picked JPMorgan last year to help
            improve the country's standing among U.S. credit-rating firms.
            The bank was also short-listed to advise on the government's
            privatization program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As with all U.S. financial institutions that operate
            globally, we are subject to specific regulatory requirements,'
            New York-based JPMorgan said in an April 1 statement. 'We will
            continue to seek guidance from the U.S. government on
            implementing their recent sanctions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Largest Note Tied to Indian Rupee in 40 Months</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $24.1
            million of notes tied to the Indian rupee, the largest such
            offering since November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The one-year securities, issued March 28, yield a maximum
            of 16.3 percent if called after 12 months, according to a
            prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission. If the Indian currency strengthens at all or
            depreciates no more than 1.5 percent by quarterly intervals, the
            bank will automatically redeem the notes. Investors suffer
            losses if the rupee drops more than 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The South Asian country's currency gained 3.1 percent to
            59.89 per U.S. dollar during the first three months of the year,
            its biggest quarterly advance since September 2012. The currency
            strengthened because India raised interest rates and changed
            regulations to make it easier for foreigners to invest there,
            said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market strategy at Brown
            Brothers Harriman Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'India hiked rates, delivering several hawkish surprises
            last year,' Thin said in a telephone interview. The rupee could
            strengthen to around 58 per dollar in about three months, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee reached an eight-month high on March 28. It's the
            third-best performing emerging-market currency against the
            greenback, advancing 2.7 percent this year as of 5:48 p.m. in
            New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign investors have bought $11.1 billion of Indian
            stocks and bonds this year through April 2, the most among eight
            Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rates Rise &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India kept its benchmark repurchase
            rate unchanged at 8 percent at an April 1 review after lifting
            it 0.75 percentage point since September to counter price gains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, didn't
            respond to messages seeking comment about the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. sold $50 million of six-month notes linked
            to the rupee on November 12, 2010, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
            values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Monsanto May Attract Activist Looking at Breakup, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Monsanto Co. (MON) may attract an activist
            investor after its shares underperformed since a breakup of the
            world's largest seed company may create more value for
            investors, JPMorgan Chase Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think there is a reasonable possibility of an activist
            appearance at Monsanto, although we have neither intimations nor
            knowledge of any activist intentions,' JPMorgan analysts led by
            Jeffrey J. Zekauskas said today in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Monsanto could explore the sale of its Agricultural
            Productivity segment, which makes Roundup herbicide, said
            Zekauskas, who raised his rating on the stock to buy from hold.
            The St. Louis-based company could also take on $11 billion in
            debt to buy back shares, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Activist shareholders have already targeted Monsanto's two
            largest U.S. competitors in the past year. Daniel Loeb's Third
            Point LLC has called for a breakup of Dow Chemical Co., which
            produces genetically modified seeds as well as petrochemicals.
            DuPont Co., another chemicals-and-seeds conglomerate, is
            spinning off its titanium-dioxide business after Nelson Peltz's
            Trian Fund Management LP amassed a stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;No one at Monsanto could immediately be reached for
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Monsanto rose 1.6 percent to $116.30 at 8:47 a.m. before
            the start of regular trading in New York. It gained 9.5 percent
            in the year through yesterday while the Standard Poor's 500
            Index climbed 22 percent. Monsanto yesterday posted fiscal
            second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Leon Black, who made billions by
            buying up debt of companies in the U.S. and Europe that others
            deemed worthless, is turning to emerging markets as the next
            source of growth for his $161 billion money management firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC (APO), the private equity and
            distressed debt specialist co-founded by Black, is starting a
            unit to primarily buy investment-grade and high-yield corporate
            debt from Latin America and Asia, according to Tolga Uzuner, the
            41-year-old heading the group. The New York-based firm will also
            invest in infrastructure, project financing and special
            situations, said Uzuner, a former managing director in the
            London branch of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s chief investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apollo and firms such as Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) that
            have largely focused on developed-market credit, are turning to
            emerging markets, where the amount of corporate debt outstanding
            tripled to $1.1 trillion over the past five years, according to
            data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For Apollo, which
            increased its credit business to more than $100 billion in
            assets from $4 billion seven years ago by scooping up everything
            from distressed assets to leveraged loans, this is one of the
            largest untapped frontiers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There was a strategic decision that this was an asset
            class that has the potential to move the needle at Apollo,'
            said Uzuner. 'A lot of the credit-underwriting skills and
            requirements for emerging markets are similar to those in the
            firm's other areas of focus.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Background &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This will be the first time Apollo has created funds
            dedicated to developing countries, though some investments were
            previously made from buyout and credit funds, said Uzuner, who
            Apollo recruited in October as he was looking to raise money for
            his own hedge-fund firm, Brocade Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Uzuner left JPMorgan last year, where his duties included
            investing the bank's excess cash in high-quality emerging market
            corporate debt. The investment office was at the center of the
            London Whale trading strategy that caused a $6.2 billion trading
            loss for the New York-based bank. JPMorgan has said it will fold
            the operation into its Treasury unit, according to an internal
            memo obtained yesterday by Bloomberg. Uzuner, who also worked at
            Bankers Trust and Credit Suisse Group AG, wasn't involved in the
            trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve triggered a pullback from
            emerging-markets in June, when the central bank signaled it
            would reduce stimulus prompting international investors to pull
            money out of assets considered more risky. The shift accelerated
            as slowing economic growth in Brazil and China led to ratings
            cuts and an increase in non-performing loans, with money only
            recently returning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Apollo Hires &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apollo also hired Stuart Firth, who worked at Brocade and
            previously ran European distressed-debt trading at Credit
            Suisse, and Richard Martin, founding partner of Longwood Credit
            Partners LP. The firm plans to start multiple funds during the
            next several years, said Uzuner, declining to comment on the
            potential size of Apollo Emerging Markets LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apollo is expanding as some of the largest emerging
            economies -- including Brazil -- decelerate, geopolitical
            tensions escalate and corporate defaults increase, often in
            countries where legal frameworks can heighten investment risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Even places like Chile and Brazil, which are very highly
            rated countries, have encountered a lot of defaults for a
            variety of reasons, mainly failed government policies,' said
            David Hinman, the chief investment officer of SW Asset
            Management LLC, a Newport Beach, California, firm that invests
            in emerging-market corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Brazil Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The challenges in those markets were highlighted by one of
            Carlyle Group LP's first investments in Brazil. Real-estate
            developer Urbplan Desenvolvimento Urbano SA, has been hit with
            hundreds of lawsuits, in part for failing to complete home sites
            across Brazil, according to court and regulatory filings.
            Partners at the private equity firm have reached into their own
            pockets to help rescue the investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dollar-based default rate on Latin American corporate
            debt soared to 7.6 percent last year from 2.5 percent in 2012
            and 0.8 percent in 2011, according to data from JPMorgan. Hinman
            estimates there is about $50 billion of distressed debt now
            available in the region, including some $3.6 billion of dollar-denominated debt issued by Eike Batista's
            Oleo Gas
            Participacoes SA (OGXP3), the Rio de Janeiro-based energy company that
            filed for bankruptcy protection in October. The average yield on
            a JPMorgan index of emerging market corporate bonds rose to 6.1
            percent in September from a low of 4.4 percent in January 2013.
            The yield has since dropped to 5.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Headline Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are a lot of unknowns and a lot of headline risk,'
            said Ted Neild, chief investment officer of Gresham Partners
            LLC, which manages almost $5 billion for some 80 family offices
            and set up Gresham Emerging Markets Strategies LP to increase
            its allocation to the sector. 'But if we can get the right
            companies at the right prices, we think there is a good long-term opportunity.' The Chicago-based firm will
            primarily invest
            in stocks instead of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York and Chicago-based
            manager that oversees more than $1 billion of emerging-market
            debt in separate accounts, anticipates continued pressure on the
            sector. Still, it plans to increase the number of debt and
            equity funds it devotes to developing economies. The firm is
            adding capabilities as most other firms don't commit new
            resources, Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer for
            Guggenheim Partners LLC, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Oaktree Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A small number of distressed debt specialists are joining
            that bet. Oaktree has raised $842 million for emerging market
            corporate debt and has about $1 billion under management in
            emerging-market equities, the Los Angeles-based firm said in
            February. Cerberus Capital Management LP, the New York-based
            firm run by Stephen Feinberg, incorporated Cerberus South
            American Investments LLC this year to make potential investments
            in the region, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our emerging market debt strategy may well become one of
            the most substantial parts of our business,' John Frank,
            Oaktree's managing principal, said on an earnings call in
            February. The firm had $83.6 billion in assets under management
            as of Dec. 31, a figure that has more than doubled since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apollo prides itself on being a contrarian. It got its
            start from one of the best-known distressed debt opportunities
            of the early 1990s, when the firm received financial backing
            from the French bank Credit Lyonnais to bid on a portfolio of
            junk bonds held by the insolvent Executive Life Insurance Co.
            Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. banker, won the
            auction with a bid of $3.25 billion, or about 50 cents on the
            dollar, and ultimately reaped fees totaling as much as $350
            million from the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year the firm exited its investment from
            LyondellBasell Industries NV, capping a gain of more than $10
            billion, the largest ever for a private-equity deal, after
            buying debt in the chemicals maker at the height of the
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apollo now oversees $161 billion, as of Dec. 31 and Black
            has an estimated net worth of $6.2 billion, according to the
            Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Apollo shares fell 2.5 percent to
            $31 at the close in New York, paring the gain to 29 percent in
            the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's clearly a large market opportunity,' Uzuner said.
            'Emerging markets is deemed an asset class that has size, depth
            and breadth.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Probably Join Morgan Stanley on Mall IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will probably
            join Morgan Stanley (MS) as global coordinator on the initial public
            offering of Emaar Properties PJSC's (EMAAR) shopping malls and retail
            business, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks were informally hired, though no documents have
            yet been signed, said the people, who asked not to be named
            because the information is private. Emaar is also appointing
            lead managers for the sale, the people said. An official at
            Emaar who didn't want to be identified said no advisers have
            been appointed. Spokesmen for JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emaar, developer of the world's tallest tower in Dubai,
            hired Morgan Stanley to advise on what will be the largest share
            sale in the Middle East and Africa since 2008, Chairman Mohamed Alabbar said in a March 18 interview. The
            company plans to raise
            8 billion dirhams ($2.2 billion) to 9 billion dirhams from the
            sale as a tourism boom adds to retail sales in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Middle Eastern companies are taking advantage of rebounding
            stock markets and asset prices to raise funds through IPOs and
            secondary offerings. Emirates Reit, the United Arab Emirates'
            first real-estate investment trust, said last week it increased
            its share sale to $175 million to accommodate investor demand
            for Dubai's first IPO for at least five years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank Said to Manage Potential Greek Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Greece tapped JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            and Deutsche Bank AG to manage an expected debt offering as it
            seeks a return to the capital markets, according to people with
            knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms will underwrite the deal as the nation with the
            worst jobless rate in the euro area attempts to sell bonds for
            the first time since being shut out in early 2010, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
            authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greece's Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras suggested last
            week that the government would issue notes in the first half of
            2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growing confidence among officials on the prospect of
            selling debt has risen as bond yields have fallen to a four-year
            low. Their optimism rests on the premise of persuading investors
            that Greece will shake off a six-year recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Greek 10-year bonds has dropped below 6.2
            percent from more than 30 percent in 2012. Greek securities have
            returned 31 percent this year, the best performance among the 34
            sovereign debt markets tracked by the Bloomberg World Bond
            Indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Germany has welcomed the planned bond sale as evidence that
            'confidence of the financial markets is returning' to Greece,
            Nadine Kalwey, a spokeswoman for Germany's Finance Ministry,
            said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greece's financing situation has already benefited from a
            budget surplus before interest costs of almost 3 billion euros
            ($4.1 billion), which the government expects the European
            Union's statistics agency to confirm this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, three officials said that the government planned
            to sell 2 billion euros of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase Co. and the U.K.'s
            Department for International Development will contribute a
            combined $20 million to a private-equity fund investing in
            startup businesses operating in East Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DFID's Impact Fund, which is managed by CDC Group, a
            development finance institution owned by the U.K. government,
            will provide $15 million to Novastar Ventures and JPMorgan the
            rest, the companies said today in an e-mailed statement. The
            money will finance health care, education, housing, energy and
            sanitation projects that are expected to reach as many as 2
            million people over the next decade, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Private sector capital is crucial to economic growth in
            East Africa,' Peter Scher, head of corporate responsibility at
            JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. 'There
            is a recognition that governmental and aid organizations cannot
            do this alone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should accelerate investments to build
            infrastructure in Africa and form public-private partnerships
            that will help improve economic and social conditions, Kenyan
            President Uhuru Kenyatta said on April 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It marks the first investment released from the 75 million-pound ($124 million) Impact Fund
            announced by the U.K. in 2012
            to provide capital to companies and programs that will generate
            returns in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Social Good &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novastar is focusing its investments on 'early-stage
            businesses that offer massive social benefits to low-income
            households,' Managing Director Steve Beck said on April 5 by
            phone from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Novastar will accelerate the existing investment program
            of SpringHill Equity Partners, an informal investor circle that
            has been making venture investments in East Africa,' Beck said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novastar in March made its initial investment in Bridge
            International Academies, which has built more than 250 schools
            in Kenya, according to the statement. The Nairobi-based chain of
            nursery and primary schools charges students an average of $5 a
            month, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Market-based approaches, along with interested investors,
            can attract the private sector capital necessary to create
            change,' Scher said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private equity funds invested more than three times as much
            in sub-Saharan Africa last year as they did in 2012 as the
            number of deals during the period rose to 84 from 58, according
            to the 2014 East Africa Private Equity Confidence Survey
            released by Deloitte. In East Africa, the number of deals in
            Kenya last year was 12, five in Rwanda, and three each in Uganda
            and Tanzania, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Pinto Shuffles Deputies, Names Hernandez Unit Co-Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named Carlos Hernandez co-head of global banking with Jeff Urwin as
            corporate
            and investment-banking chief Daniel Pinto overhauls the
            division's leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hernandez and Urwin, 58, will manage corporate banking,
            investment banking and treasury services, according to a staff
            memo today from Pinto. Hernandez previously led New York-based
            JPMorgan's investor-services team. Don McCree, 52, who was named
            head of corporate banking and treasury services in a 2012
            reorganization, is leaving the firm, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pinto, 51, became sole investment-banking chief of the
            biggest U.S. lender by assets last month after Mike Cavanagh,
            48, left to join private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP. The
            surprise departure forced Pinto to restructure reporting lines,
            promoting veterans including Hernandez, who joined JPMorgan in
            the 1980s and rose to head of global equities and other roles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Horner, who managed the markets and investor-services
            financing units, will succeed Hernandez as head of investor
            services. Joyce Chang was named global head of research, filling
            the position after Tom Schmidt asked for a new role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oversight of the bank's remaining commodities operation
            will be shared by James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, who were named
            co-heads of global rates, foreign exchange, commodities and
            emerging markets, according to the memo. Blythe Masters, 45,
            said last week she planned to leave the firm after helping
            complete the $3.5 billion sale of its physical commodities unit
            to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

            co-op unit on the ground floor of his Manhattan apartment

            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, and his wife, Judy, completed the purchase of
            the property at 1185 Park Ave. on March 22, according to records
            made public today by the New York City Department of Finance.
            The couple own a 16th-floor residence in the building. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sellers of the commercial co-op were listed as Stephen
            Marks and George Ellis, cardiologists whose practice was located
            at the address. The unit is one of 11 on the ground floor of the
            building, located between 93rd and 94th Streets. &lt;/p&gt;

            book, or just a place to work, or have a private office.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miller's firm has appraised other ground-floor offices in
            the building. He wasn't involved in Dimon's deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniela Kunen, a broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate
            who listed the property for sale, didn't immediately return a
            telephone message seeking comment on the deal. Mark Kornblau, a
            JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Collateralized loan obligations will
            raise $3 billion to $5 billion in Europe this year, according to
            a forecast from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CLO formation in the region will increase global issuance
            to as much as $75 billion, JPMorgan analysts led by London-based
            Rishad Ahluwalia wrote in an April 5 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The spread for the AAA rated portion of European CLOs may
            be at about 120 basis points by the end of 2013, according to
            the research report, which cited the results of a survey from 81
            clients. For U.S. deals, the respondents see spreads at 90 basis
            points to 100 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC and Pramerica Investment
            Management Ltd. are marketing European CLOs which may price the
            top-ranked notes at about 135 basis points more than the euro
            interbank offered rate, people with knowledge of the matter
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;London-based Cairn Capital Ltd. sold its 300.5 million-euro
            deal in February with the AAA piece at 140 basis points more
            than Euribor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis
            point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
            high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
            varying risk and return. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dimon Exit Seen Hastened If JPMorgan Names Separate Chairman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) investors risk
            shortening Jamie Dimon's tenure as chief executive officer if
            they appoint a separate chairman to help lead the bank,
            according to Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the board is forced by a shareholder vote to strip
            Jamie Dimon of his chairman's role, then shareholders may find
            that Jamie Dimon decides to move on, maybe not immediately but
            within the year,' Peabody wrote in a note to clients today.
            'If that were to occur, is there someone with Mr. Dimon's
            talents capable of stepping into the breach?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon, 57, to give up the chairmanship have been
            building since the bank disclosed risk-control lapses on
            derivatives bets last year that fueled more than $6.2 billion in
            losses. In March, the New York-based firm's board urged
            investors to vote against naming a separate chairman at the next
            shareholder meeting, saying that Dimon's dual role remains the
            'most effective leadership model.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon told investors in February that he wouldn't have
            agreed to take a previous job, leading Bank One Corp., if the
            board hadn't given him both roles, Peabody recalled. JPMorgan
            acquired Bank One in 2004 to create the company it is today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Structured Notes Mirror JPMorgan's London Whale Credit Trades</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are boosting sales of
            structured notes based on derivative bets similar to those that
            cost JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) more than $6 billion in the so-called
            London Whale loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nordea Bank AB (NDA), SEB AB and BNP Paribas SA (BNP) sold more than
            $60 million of notes this year tied to portions of credit-
            default swap indexes protecting against losses on company debt.
            The tranches offer investors varying degrees of risk among a
            pool of companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil became known as the London
            Whale because of the size of his trades in tranches of the
            Markit iTraxx CDX North American Investment Grade index of
            swaps. Nordea and SEB's structured notes are mainly linked to
            portions of the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of investment-grade
            companies and the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index, which tracks
            mainly junk-rated companies in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Sophisticated investors should run far and fast from
            this,' said Janet Tavakoli, founder of Chicago-based consulting
            firm Tavakoli Structured Finance Inc. Wealthy individuals, who
            are the main buyers of the securities, are unlikely to
            understand all the risks they are taking or be appropriately
            compensated for them, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuers of the notes generate income by selling default
            insurance on portions of the credit indexes that have various
            levels of risk and reward. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;iTraxx Europe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nordea sold $35.5 million of notes tied to the 4 percent to
            12 percent tranche of the latest series of the Markit iTraxx
            Europe index. That means investors start losing money when
            losses on the index reach 4 percent, and that they're wiped out
            when they exceed 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes pay as much as 5 percent, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The largest Nordic lender also issued
            46.1 million Norwegian kroner ($8 million) of securities
            yesterday linked to the 10 percent to 100 percent tranche of the
            Crossover index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors are looking for additional yield through
            leverage and these notes are one way of achieving that,' said
            Antti Parviainen, head of investment products for Finland at
            Nordea in Helsinki. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in the note linked to the Crossover tranche would
            start losing money when eight companies on the index default,
            according to Abel Elizalde, European credit derivatives
            strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London. His calculations are
            based on a 40 percent recovery rate, the amount bondholders
            would get back in a default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Significant Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Structured notes tied to index tranches can have
            'significantly higher' risks than notes tied to whole indexes
            or single companies, said Elizalde. Potential returns on the
            securities can also be higher, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Norwegian papermaker Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG) is the
            company in the Crossover index with the highest perceived risk
            of failure, with credit-default swap prices signaling an 82
            percent chance the company won't be able to meet its liabilities
            within the next five years, Bloomberg data show. Spanish gaming
            company Codere SA has an 78 percent probability of default,
            swaps show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global speculative-grade default rate is forecast to
            end this year at 2.8 percent, compared with an average of 4.7
            percent since 1983, Moody's Investors Service said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SEB also sold notes tied to tranches of the Markit's iTraxx
            Europe and Crossover indexes, said Holger Cassens, head of
            structured derivatives at SEB's German unit in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Capital Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Stockholm-based lender issued 5 million euros ($6.5
            million) of notes in November that are linked to the 12 percent
            to 50 percent tranche of the Crossover index and pay 8.75
            percent, Bloomberg data show. Investors' capital is protected
            for up to five credit events, after which their principal will
            be reduced by 5 percent for every additional credit event, said
            Cassens. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also sold $6.2 million of five-year notes on Feb.
            12 linked to the 16 percent to 35 percent tranche of the Markit
            CDX North American High Yield Index, Bloomberg data show. The
            securities were sold via two offerings in dollars and euros with
            coupons of 6 percent and 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Demand is rising for these notes because investors get
            more attractive yields and they are protected for a few credit
            events,' said Cassens. 'You can't predict what will happen in
            the future, but so far clients feel comfortable with the
            buffer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sold the first structured
            notes tied to a credit default-swap index tranche in November
            2005, when it issued 15 million euros of 10-year securities tied
            to the 3 percent to 6 percent portion of the fourth series of
            the Markit iTraxx Europe Index, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes were unsecured and investors lost their money
            when the U.S. bank collapsed in September 2008. Note holders
            would be creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Job Cuts as Banks Seek to Bolster Profit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Rising stock prices, rebounding profits, restored dividends and a growing economy are signaling to
            U.S. banks it's time for more job cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even after the industry posted its best results
            since 2006, the six largest U.S. banks announced plans in the first three months of this year to eliminate
            about 21,000 positions, or 1.8 percent of their combined workforce, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            That's the most since 2011's third quarter. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), whose 259,000 people produced three
            straight years of record profit, topped the list with 17,000 reductions scheduled by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are under pressure to keep profit climbing amid weak revenue growth, and employees are among
            the biggest expenses after interest costs. The most vulnerable people work in units where demand is waning
            such as mortgage foreclosures. Their departures would come on top of 320,000 jobs culled from U.S. financial
            companies in the past five years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They have a better feel for what their
            business model looks like and they are starting to align headcount,' said Robert Dicks, a principal at
            Deloitte Touche LLP in New York who advises financial firms on staffing. 'We were out of whack for a couple
            of years, but we're balanced right now.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Go Daddy Operating Co., the website
            registration and hosting company, has picked Morgan Stanley (MS) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. to manage an initial public offering this
            year, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Go Daddy, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, is aiming to be
            public in the fall, one of the people said, asking not to be
            identified discussing private information. The size of the
            offering hasn't been determined, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, which has raised its profile in recent years
            with an advertising campaign featuring celebrities like race-car
            driver Danica Patrick and Israeli model Bar Refaeli, is enjoying
            high levels of customer retention and strong subscriber growth,
            according to Moody's Investors Service. Chief Executive Officer
            Blake Irving said in a July interview that sales could reach $5
            billion in two or three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Go Daddy's sales in the year through June were about $1

            Daddy could approach public markets as soon as this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment firms KKR Co., Silver Lake Management LLC and
            Technology Crossover Ventures bought a stake in Go Daddy in July

        <headline>Dimon Says JPMorgan Had 'Tin Ear' Dealing With Regulators</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; April 9 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, had a 'tin ear' when dealing with
            regulators before settling probes into mortgage lapses and
            trading losses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our response generally was, 'We know what we're doing,''
            Dimon wrote today in a letter to the New York-based bank's
            investors. 'Well, we should have done more self-examination. We
            need to be better listeners.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon is seeking to improve relations with overseers after
            lamenting in prior years that regulation could thwart growth.
            JPMorgan's earnings last year were marred by more than $20
            billion in legal settlements that contributed to the first
            quarterly loss under Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank missed signals when rivals faced scrutiny and must
            'do a better job at examining critiques of others so we can
            learn from other people's mistakes, too,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Says Cyber Intruders Could Breach Bank Defenses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is facing
            'increasingly complex and more dangerous' cyberattacks and
            some of the intruders may get through, Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is going to be a continual and likely never-ending
            battle to stay ahead of it -- and, unfortunately, not every
            battle will be won,' Dimon wrote today in his annual letter to
            shareholders of the New York-based bank. The company will boost
            spending on cybersecurity to $250 million this year from $200
            million in 2012, with future efforts expanding
            'exponentially,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global corporations have increased their focus on how to
            repel hackers since breaches were revealed by retailers
            including Target Corp. (TGT) JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets, is building three cybersecurity operations centers in
            regional headquarters to coordinate information and respond to
            threats, Dimon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators have pressed lenders to strengthen measures
            against cyber intrusions, and Richard Davis, the CEO at U.S.
            Bancorp, said in November that when a cyberattack does succeed
            against a bank, the impact probably will be big. &lt;/p&gt;

            with a risk of spinoff from universal banks,' JPMorgan analysts
            led by London-based Kian Abouhossein wrote in a research note
            today. They cited potential rule changes and curbs on capital
            and funding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should avoid Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), once the
            world's most profitable securities firm, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
            Germany's largest bank, because of pressure on earnings and the
            unknown impact of new regulations, according to the report. Both
            firms rank among the biggest sales and trading rivals for New
            York-based JPMorgan, which isn't mentioned in the report. The
            bank is scheduled to report first-quarter results tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead, the analysts favor UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group
            AG (CSGN), Switzerland's first and second-largest banks, and New York-
            based Morgan Stanley, owner of the world's biggest brokerage,
            because of their restructuring potential and ability to release
            capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue will continue at 2005 and 2006
            levels and will be led by fixed-income, currencies and
            commodities, which will account for half of the industry's sales
            by 2015, JPMorgan's analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asset Preparing for Emerging Stocks Rebound in 2nd Half</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management, the
            investing arm of the largest U.S. bank, is preparing for a
            rebound in emerging-market equities in the second half of this
            year spurred by improved earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset is buying Korean automaker shares hurt by
            investor concern that a weaker yen will limit their ability to
            compete against Japanese exporters,Richard Titherington, chief
            investment officer and head of emerging markets, said in an
            interview yesterday. The company favors consumer discretionary
            stocks with 'very low valuations' and has its biggest
            overweight position in China, he said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A strong recovery in the second half' for emerging
            market equities will 'significantly close the gap' with
            developed-nation shares, said Titherington, who manages $47
            billion in emerging-market stocks. 'We've entered some of the
            Korean auto companies where the share prices have fallen sharply
            when the yen has weakened' on expectation 'that's a temporary
            headwind,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) has dropped 2.5
            percent this year, lagging behind an 8.8 percent surge in the
            MSCI World Index (MXWO) of advanced-country stocks, as 58 percent of
            developing-nation companies reported worse fourth quarter
            earnings than estimated by analysts, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hyundai Motor Co. (005380), South Korea's biggest automaker,
            extended its decline to 8 percent this year as the Japanese yen
            reached its weakest level versus the dollar since April 2009
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The yen is around fair value now, so I would expect this
            headwind to reverse in the second half of the year,'
            Titherington said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bond Traders From JPMorgan to RBS Said Placed on Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond traders at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
            Plc (RBS) were placed on leave in recent weeks or months, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Ben Morganstein and Inga Norton, Morgan Stanley's Nicholas Bonacci, and Adam Siegel of
            RBS were told not to come to work, the people said, asking for anonymity because the matter is private. It's
            unclear why or if the actions are connected, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Jefferies Group LLC
            bond trader Jesse Litvak, 39, was convicted last month of securities fraud for lying to clients about what
            he charged them to trade mortgage bonds. Other banks including New York-based JPMorgan received requests for
            information from U.S. officials about mortgage-bond trading after Litvak's arrest, people briefed on the
            matter said in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asset-Backed Alert, an industry newsletter, reported earlier
            today that Morganstein and Siegel had been placed on leave. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norton, Morganstein and
            Siegel declined to comment when reached by phone. Bonacci didn't respond to calls and messages. Mark Lake, a
            spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), RBS's Sarah Lukashok and JPMorgan's Justin Perras declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Executive Macris Wins London Whale Report Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, a former JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) executive who oversaw the unit where a trader known
            as the London Whale caused $6.2 billion in losses, won the
            chance to respond to allegations he misled regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Macris won a ruling that he should have been allowed to
            provide comments to the Financial Conduct Authority before the
            regulator published a report on Bruno Iksil's losses. While
            Macris wasn't named, he had third-party response rights because
            his identity could be determined, a finance tribunal in London
            found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Macris, who led the international chief investment office
            at the bank, challenged the regulator over its findings in
            October. The FCA found in September that the 'conduct of CIO
            London management deliberately misled the authority about the
            situation,' according to the regulator's notice on the fine. He
            wasn't mentioned by name. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Macris 'looks forward to challenging the findings made
            against him in the final notice, which fail to take proper
            account of the actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings
            with the FCA,' a spokesman for his lawyers at Clifford Chance
            LLP said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator is seeking permission to appeal the ruling,
            it said in a statement today. If the request is rejected or
            Macris wins on appeal, then he'll be able to dispute the FCA's
            findings against him at the tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bad Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The findings 'clearly identify and criticize him,' his
            lawyers said in a statement in October. 'Macris strenuously
            denies the assertions made by the authority in the final notice
            as being factually wrong. Those assertions fail to take proper
            account of the actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings
            with the authority at the relevant time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iksil's bad bets led to $920 million in penalties from
            regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            and the FCA, which levied a 138 million-pound ($231 million)
            fine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, a former JPMorgan banker fighting
            extradition to the U.S. from Spain over the trading losses, is
            also challenging the FCA at the finance tribunal. Martin-Artajo,
            who oversaw synthetic credit trading at the CIO in London, filed
            the case last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was indicted in Manhattan federal court in
            September for allegedly helping to hide the losses caused by
            Iksil. The SEC said in a parallel lawsuit that Martin-Artajo and
            Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, engaged in a scheme
            to enhance the portfolio's apparent performance and thereby
            curry favor with supervisors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Profit Falls 19% on Trading, Mortgage Declines</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said first-quarter profit fell 19 percent on lower
            revenue from fixed-income trading and mortgages, themes that may be repeated across Wall Street next week.
            The shares declined 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income dropped to $5.27 billion, or $1.28 a share,
            from $6.53 billion, or $1.59, a year earlier, according to a statement today from New York-based JPMorgan.
            Ten analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $1.46 a share on average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the
            first of the top U.S. banks to post results for the period, said profit fell in every major division, amid a
            42 percent drop in mortgage revenue and a 21 percent slide in fixed-income trading. Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon, 58, warned investors in February that trading had fallen 15 percent for the first two months of
            2014, a decline analysts including David Konrad of Macquarie Group Ltd. blamed on a reduction in the Federal
            Reserve's bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            CreditSights Inc. in New York. 'I'm not overly worried about JPMorgan unless I see something else going on
            apart from what we already know is lower fixed-income trading and mortgage results.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) tumbled as much as 5 percent, the most in 17 months, after reporting
            first-quarter profit that fell short of analysts' estimates on lower revenue from fixed-income trading and
            mortgages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, declined 3.2 percent to $55.59 at 10:32
            a.m., after dropping to $54.55 earlier today. Excluding one-time items, profit at the New York-based company
            was $1.35 a share, David Konrad of Macquarie Group Ltd. said today in a note, falling short of the $1.46
            average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earnings slumped in every major
            division at JPMorgan, the first of the top U.S. banks to post results for the period, amid a 42 percent drop
            in mortgage revenue and a 21 percent slide in fixed-income trading. The results fell short of analysts'

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JBS SA (JBSS3), the world's largest beef
            producer, hired units of JPMorgan Chase Co. and Banco Bradesco
            SA for a 3 billion-real ($1.3 billion) initial public offering
            of its poultry and processed food unit, according to two people
            with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander
            SA (SAN), Grupo BTG Pactual (BBTG11) and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the
            share offering of JBS Foods, the people said, asking not to be
            identified because negotiations are confidential. The timing of
            the sale will depend on market conditions, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exame magazine reported the hiring of the banks on April 10.
            JBS, Banco do Brasil, Santander, JPMorgan, Itau BBA, Bradesco
            BBI SA and BTG declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JBS Foods, the second-largest producer and exporter of
            poultry and pork in Brazil, was formed after JBS agreed to buy
            Seara food processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods SA for
            5.85 billion reais in June 2013. Seara sales totaled 7.1 billion
            reais in 2012, according to Marfrig regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IPO would help unlock value by separating the unit from
            the parent company, a third person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Levin Panel Plans to Refer JPMorgan Whale Loss to Justice, SEC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Carl Levin said he
            plans to forward results from his panel's nine-month
            investigation into JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s record trading loss to
            the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission to
            review for possible wrongdoing by company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When you say criminal referrals, there will be referrals
            to the Justice Department and to the regulators, the Securities
            and Exchange Commission,' Levin, chairman of the Senate
            Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said today in an
            interview on Bloomberg Television's 'Political Capital With Al Hunt.' 'We've laid out hundreds of pages of
            what I consider to
            be wrongful practices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The committee said last month that New York-based JPMorgan,
            led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, dodged regulators
            and misled investors as losses swelled on a derivatives bet by a
            trader known as the London Whale because of the size of his
            bets. Managers at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, manipulated
            risk models and pressured traders to overvalue their positions
            in an effort to hide growing losses, according to the
            committee's report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said referrals to the
            Justice Department and the SEC are 'fairly routine' following
            a review by his panel and, if staff hasn't already sent their
            report to investigators, they should. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While he wouldn't say whether he believed there was
            criminal activity at JPMorgan, Levin said, 'I'm very
            disappointed, though, that there has not been action taken
            criminally against some of the higher-ups' on Wall Street,
            declining to name individual companies or executives. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan 33% Profit Jump Beats Estimates on Reserve Releases</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s first- quarter profit rose 33 percent to a record on expense reductions
            and an improvement in consumer credit quality that allowed the bank to boost earnings by reducing loan-loss
            reserves. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income climbed to $6.53 billion, or $1.59 a share, from
            $4.92 billion, or $1.19, in the same period a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
            statement. Twenty-eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated earnings per share of $1.39 adjusted for a
            one-time accounting item. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, lifted
            profit by shrinking expenses 16 percent, as he grappled with a 4 percent reduction in total net revenue.
            Earnings also were buoyed by a drop in late payments, which helped the consumer bank reduce its loan-loss
            reserve by $1.2 billion. The shares fell 0.6 percent as some analysts questioned whether JPMorgan can
            continue posting record earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The reserve releases aren't sustainable,' said

            estimates that the reserve releases, a tax-benefit and a one-time accounting adjustment resulted in about 26
            cents per share of 'non-quality' earnings in the quarter, without which JPMorgan would have missed
            estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

            After three straight years of posting record net income, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is cutting
            expenses, responding to sluggish global growth and low interest rates that compress profit margins on
            lending and yields on investments. Close

        <headline>JPMorgan Shrinks Compensation Pool 7% at Investment-Bank Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and investment bank set aside 7 percent less money for
            employee compensation in the first quarter while the division generated 9 percent more revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $3.38 billion in compensation costs amounted to 34 percent of revenue, excluding
            accounting adjustments, down from 35 percent a year earlier, according to figures posted today on the New
            York-based firm's website. The pay pool is large enough to give each of the division's 51,634 employees
            $65,383 for the three months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investment banks have faced pressure to cut costs as
            revenue from trading, advisory and underwriting at the nine largest global firms fell almost 10 percent from
            2010 through 2012. Executives have sought to lower compensation-to-revenue ratios while retaining top
            bankers and traders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We really believe in pay for performance,' Mike Cavanagh, co-head
            of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, told shareholders in February. The bank's scale can help it
            keep that ratio low while offering top employees pay that's at least as good as 'anybody else in our
            industry,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm's corporate bank
            and treasury and securities-services units last year, and put Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto in charge of the
            division. The group has more than twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Switches Risk Model Again After Whale Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), whose trading
            loss of more than $6.2 billion last year was fueled by the
            adoption of a formula that understated risks, has adopted yet
            another model. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said today it employed a new formula to judge the
            risk of its credit derivatives position, at least the fourth
            such model it's used since January 2012. The portfolio was built
            by Bruno Iksil, known as the London Whale because his bets were
            so big they moved markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank changed its measurement of value at risk, or VaR,
            for the credit derivatives book in the first quarter of this
            year 'to achieve consistency with like products' within the
            corporate and investment bank, JPMorgan said today in a
            supplement. 'This change had an insignificant impact' to
            average VaR for fixed income and the investment bank's trading
            and credit portfolio, the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously changed the VaR model, which
            estimates the most amount of money a trading position can lose
            on 95 percent of the trading days, when the corporate and
            investment bank took over most of the credit book from the chief
            investment office last year. That change last year reduced
            JPMorgan's estimated risk by 24 percent to $115 million in the
            third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named Bo Zethraeus as head of investment banking for Sweden as dealmaking
            picks up in the Nordic region, replacing Johan Lustig, who left
            to join Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zethraeus, who was the New York-based bank's head of equity
            capital markets for the Nordic countries, has more than 25 years
            of experience as an investment banker in Sweden and built
            relationships with companies, private-equity firms and the
            government, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo and said
            Zethraeus will report to Jake Donavan, senior country officer
            for the Benelux and Nordic nations. The memo was written by
            Donavan as well as Klaus Hessberger and Achintya Mangla, co-heads of the equity capital markets team in
            Europe, the Middle
            East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zethraeus joined JPMorgan from Skandinaviska Enskilda
            Banken AB (SEBA) in 2001. JPMorgan plans to announce his replacement as
            head of Nordic equity capital markets soon, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advised Nets Holding A/S on its sale to Advent
            International Corp., Bain Capital LLC and Danish pension fund
            ATP last month, as well as Jyske Bank A/S on its acquisition of
            BRFkredit A/S for about $1.36 billion in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America hired Lustig to be head of global corporate
            and investment banking in the Nordic region, according to a memo
            to the bank's staff on April 7. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>A&amp;amp;E Networks Said to Tap JPMorgan Media Banker as New CFO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;David Granville-Smith, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s media investment banker, is joining AE Television
            Networks LLC as chief financial officer, said two people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granville-Smith,
            also known as 'Digger,' resigned last week as a managing director at JPMorgan, where he oversaw the media
            investment banking group, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the job change hasn't been
            announced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nancy Dubuc, chief executive officer of the company, which goes by A+E
            Networks, is hiring Granville-Smith to bring new thinking into the senior executive team, one person said.
            While A+E Networks, a joint venture between Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Hearst Corp., isn't seeking immediate
            acquisitions, it wants to create new networks out of its less-watched channels, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As the pay-TV business evolves, with more people viewing programming on the web, Dubuc was seeking
            a finance chief who could offer strategic advice, said the person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Granville-Smith,
            A+E Networks is gaining an executive who has worked on large media deals. At JPMorgan, he advised A+E
            Networks on the repurchase of a stake held by Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s NBCUniversal in 2012. He also
            represented Madison Square Garden Inc. (MSG) on the sale of its Fuse TV network. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            hiring requires the approval of A+E Network's board, which is scheduled to meet in a couple weeks, said one
            of the people. Granville-Smith is expected to start in July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael Feeney, a spokesman
            for New York-based A+E Networks, declined to comment, as did Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan.
            Granville-Smith didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gerard Gruosso, who has
            been A+E Network's finance chief since 2002, announced his retirement two months ago, according to an
            internal company memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Gruosso is remaining through a transition period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A+E Networks operates the AE, History and Lifetime channels, which carry the popular 'Duck Dynasty'
            and 'Pawn Stars' series. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named Luis Oganes as global head of emerging markets research amid a

            &lt;p&gt;Oganes was promoted from head of Latin America research to

            markets Asia research, and Michael Marrese, the head of emerging
            Europe, Middle East, and Africa research, will report to Oganes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's corporate and investment-banking chief Daniel
            Pinto announced 15 staff changes in a memo April 7, including
            the promotion of Carlos Hernandez and Jeff Urwin to co-heads of
            global banking. Chang succeeded Tom Schmidt, who had asked for a

            average VaR for fixed income and the investment bank's trading
            and credit portfolio, the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had previously changed the VaR model, which
            estimates the most amount of money a trading position can lose
            on 95 percent of the trading days, when the corporate and
            investment bank took over most of the credit book from the chief

            JPMorgan's estimated risk by 24 percent to $115 million in the
            third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's switch of risk models in January of last year
            may have helped fuel the trading loss at the chief investment
            office, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told the Senate
            Banking Committee in June. The January 2012 switch and the
            timing of the firm's disclosures are the focus of an inquiry by
            the Securities and Exchange Commission as the U.S. examines how
            long executives knew about the CIO's swelling bets and losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, U.S. Senator Carl Levin said he plans to
            forward results from his panel's nine-month investigation into
            JPMorgan Chase's record trading loss to the Justice Department
            and SEC to review for possible wrongdoing by company executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Levin made the remarks in an interview on Bloomberg
            Television April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
            comment on Levin's remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said referrals to the
            Justice Department and the SEC are 'fairly routine' following
            a review by his panel and, if the staff hasn't already sent
            their report to investigators, they should. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Europe Moves Toward Tax-Evasion Clampdown After Six-Nation Push &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Union moved closer to agreement on a
            coordinated clampdown on tax evasion as a total of nine
            countries backed an initiative for automatic sharing of bank
            details across borders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bloc's six biggest nations won support from the
            Netherlands, Belgium and Romania for their proposal to adopt the
            U.S.'s FATCA information-exchange program, EU Tax Commissioner
            Algirdas Semeta said in Dublin yesterday. Semeta also said the
            27-nation EU is closing in on updates to a savings tax accord as
            holdouts Luxembourg and Austria show willingness to compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Governments from the U.K. to Poland are eyeing what the
            commission estimates is 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) of lost
            tax revenue as many European nations struggle to narrow budget
            deficits. Politics is also spurring the initiative, notably in
            France, where President Francois Hollande's popularity has
            slumped after his budget minister resigned and admitted having
            an offshore bank account following months of denials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luxembourg, one of the countries that previously resisted
            giving up its banking secrecy rules, dropped its opposition
            April 10, though Finance Minister Luc Frieden said April 13 that
            he wants Europe to win broader global support for the initiative
            within the Group of 20 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The position of Austria, the other EU nation that has
            defended banking secrecy, may also be shifting. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division said it
            will stop publicly naming individuals associated with corporate
            antitrust plea agreements who aren't believed to be culpable in
            any alleged wrongdoing, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The names of so-called carved-out employees, which included
            those who refused to cooperate with a probe, are currently
            included in publicly filed corporate plea deals, Assistant U.S.
            Attorney General Bill Baer said April 12 in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Employees against whom the government is still developing
            evidence, or employees with 'potentially relevant information'
            who can't be located, will be omitted from the publicly filed
            portion of plea agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the past, corporate plea agreements have included a
            provision offering non-prosecution protection to those employees
            who cooperate and whose conduct didn't warrant prosecution.'The
            division excluded, or carved out, employees who were believed to
            be culpable from such receiving non-prosecution deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baer said the division will continue to exclude from non-
            prosecution agreements any employees whose conduct may warrant
            prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those decisions will be made on an 'employee-by-employee
            basis' depending on the evidence, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will continue to demand the full cooperation of anyone
            who seeks to benefit from the non-prosecution protection of a
            corporate plea agreement, and will revoke that protection for
            anyone who does not fully and truthfully cooperate with division
            investigations,' Baer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;CBRC Orders Banks to Control Loans to LGFVs, Sina.Com Says &lt;/h2&gt;

            control their total outstanding loans to local government
            financing vehicles, or LGFVs, Sina.com reported, citing
            guidelines dated April 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks also must cap the proportion of LGFV loans at last
            year's levels to vehicles that have cash-flow coverage ratios of
            less than 100 percent or liability-to-asset ratios higher than
            80 percent, the report cited the guidelines as saying. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Banks are leaving the panel that sets ISDAFix, the
            benchmark for the $379 trillion swaps market, as regulators
            probe suspected manipulation of the rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Europe's largest bank by assets, and
            Japan's Mizuho Financial Group (8411) stopped contributing to the
            ISDAFix dollar rate between November and January, and haven't
            been replaced, documents on the International Swaps and
            Derivatives Association's website show. The industry group
            didn't give any reason for the lenders' departure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Firms are pulling out of rates such as the London interbank
            offered rate, Euribor and ISDAFix on growing concern that they
            may face lawsuits, fines and criminal penalties if found to have
            engaged in wrongdoing. Without data from a large number of
            firms, benchmarks risk becoming unrepresentative and losing the

            &lt;h2&gt;Barclays Received Most U.K. Bank Customer Complaints, FCA Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) topped the list of the most-complained about
            U.K. financial institutions in the second half of last year,
            according to data compiled by the markets regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank, based in London, received 414,302 complaints, a 6
            percent decrease from the first half of 2012, the Financial
            Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. Lloyds
            TSB Bank Plc was second with 349,386, a 19 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. banks have been buffeted by a series of consumer
            scandals in recent years, including improper sales of loan
            insurance and some derivatives products. The sales of the loan
            insurance, known as PPI, topped the list of complaints, followed
            by checking accounts, general insurance products, credit cards,
            and savings accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays said in a statement that it is continuing to make
            improvements to its customer service and has seen complaints
            fall by 184,000 in comparison to 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our sole focus is on helping our customers and getting it
            right so they don't feel the need to complain in the first
            place,' the bank said in a statement. 'These actions will
            make a big difference going forward.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Google Offer to Settle EU Antitrust Probe Unacceptable to Rivals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)'s offer to settle an antitrust probe with the
            European Union by labeling its own services more clearly in Web
            search results is a 'non-starter' for competitors such as
            Microsoft Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, French legal search engine Foundem and at least
            10 other companies that filed complaints against Google with the
            EU will be able to give feedback on the remedies submitted by
            the Mountain View, California-based company to settle the almost
            three-year-old investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google, operator of the world's largest Internet search
            engine, told the Brussels-based EU that it would create more
            distinction in searches between its own services and
            competitors, a person familiar with the negotiations said last
            week. Google also proposed to offer links to rival search
            engines, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
            the details of the offer aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU is preparing a market test based on Google's formal
            submission, Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for EU Competition
            Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said last week while declining to
            comment on the specifics of Google's offer. Al Verney, a
            spokesman for Google in Brussels, said that the company
            continues to cooperate with the commission. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Standard Chartered in Talks With Zimbabwe on Black Ownership &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), the U.K.'s second-largest bank by
            market value, said it's in talks with Zimbabwe's government on
            plans to increase black ownership of its business in the
            southern African nation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vicki Robinson, a spokeswoman for the London-based bank,
            made the statement in an April 12 e-mailed response to
            questions. 'Standard Chartered has taken the conscious decision
            to continue to maintain our long-standing commitment to doing
            business in Zimbabwe,' she said in the e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the country's law, foreign-owned companies must sell
            or cede 51 percent of their operations to black Zimbabweans or
            the state-owned National Indigenization and Economic Empowerment
            Board. The head of the board, Wilson Gwatiringa, said Standard
            Chartered may lose its license if the bank doesn't comply with
            the law, the state-owned Herald newspaper reported April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That came after Harare-based Newsday April 11 reported that
            Zimbabwe Central Bank Governor Gideon Gono said there were no
            plans to force Standard Chartered to close. Impala Platinum
            Holdings Ltd. (IMP) and Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS), the world's
            biggest platinum producers, have agreed to cede 51 percent of
            their Zimbabwe operations to black ownership, while Barclays Plc
            and Standard Bank Group Ltd. have also submitted plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered, which operates in 16 African countries,
            said earlier this year that income from Africa rose 15 percent
            to $1.59 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BlackBerry Asks Regulators to Probe 'False' Returns Report &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry (BBRY), the Canadian smartphone maker, said it will ask
            securities regulators to investigate a report that its new
            phones have high return rates, arguing that the 'false'
            information may have been released in a deliberate attempt to
            manipulate its stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Detwiler Fenton Co., a financial-services firm in Boston,
            said April 11 that U.S. retailers were seeing a significant
            increase in customers returning their Z10 phones because they
            don't find them easy to use. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In several cases, returns are now exceeding sales, a
            phenomenon we have never seen before,' Detwiler Fenton said.
            The report contributed to a 7.8 percent plunge in BlackBerry
            shares April 11, marking the stock's worst one-day drop in
            almost two months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry, based in Waterloo, Ontario, responded that
            sales are meeting expectations and return rates are in line with
            the rest of the industry. It asked both the U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission to
            review the Detwiler report, saying it was either 'a gross
            misreading of the data or a willful manipulation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd. (BB), is
            counting on the new Z10 phone -- and its pending companion
            device, the Q10 -- to fuel a turnaround after years of market-
            share losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anne Buckley, a spokeswoman for Detwiler Fenton, didn't
            immediately return a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;MT Says Fed Money-Laundering Review Delays Hudson City Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MT Bank Corp. (MTB) said a Federal Reserve review of its
            compliance with anti-money-laundering rules has delayed its
            planned purchase of Hudson City Bancorp. (HCBK) Both lenders declined
            in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MT hired an outside consulting firm as part of its effort
            to respond to the Fed, the Buffalo, New York-based bank said
            April 12 in a statement with Hudson City. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In view of the potential timeframe required to implement
            this initiative, demonstrate its efficacy to the satisfaction of
            the Federal Reserve and otherwise meet any other regulatory
            requirements that may be imposed in connection with these
            matters, MT and Hudson City believe that the timeframe for
            closing the transaction will be extended substantially,' the
            companies said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks postponed until Jan. 31 the date at which either
            party can terminate the deal if a combination hasn't already
            been closed, and said 'there can be no assurances that the
            merger will be completed by that date.' The prior deadline was
            Aug. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MT announced the agreement in August, valued at $3.7
            billion at the time, as part of an effort to expand into New
            Jersey. Hudson City has said record-low interest rates are
            pressuring profits from residential lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MT said it will discuss the status of the Hudson City deal
            at a conference call scheduled for today to discuss first-
            quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman, declined to comment on the
            regulator's interactions with MT. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Societe Generale Faces French Regulator Probe, Les Echos Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Societe Generale (GLE) faces a probe by Autorite des Marches
            Financiers, the French market regulator, Les Echos reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An official from the regulator called for an 800,000 euro
            ($1.05 million) fine and an official warning for the bank, the
            newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Societe Generale doesn't have enough employees in its
            custodian bank unit to carry out relations with and audits of
            fund management companies correctly, the AMF official said,
            according to Les Echos. The regulator's sanctions committee will
            decide on the case in 'a few weeks', according to the
            newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-Altium Banker Charged With Insider Trading by U.K. Regulator &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A former managing director at Altium Capital Ltd. was
            charged in an insider-trading ring and will face trial next year
            along with a former Deutsche Bank AG broker and four other men. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grant Harrison was charged today with one count of
            conspiracy to commit insider trading, said Joseph Eyre, a
            spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority. Harrison's case
            was transferred to a higher criminal court for a hearing in
            September. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harrison will be added as a defendant in the case against
            Martyn Dodgson, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank, a
            lawyer for the regulator said at a hearing last month. The case
            is scheduled to go to trial in September 2014 and last as long
            as three months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The charges stem from the FSA's biggest insider-trading
            investigation, known as Operation Tabernula, Latin for little
            tavern. The U.K. regulator arrested seven people and raided 16
            addresses in London and southeast England in March 2010 as the
            FSA sought to crack down on insider trading among bankers and
            traders in London's financial district. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Altium said in a statement last month that the allegations
            relate to a period when Harrison worked with a previous
            employer. Harrison's lawyer, Gary Bloxsome, didn't immediately
            respond to a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Targeting Gulf Leaps to No. 2 for Bonds: Arab Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. is gaining
            ground in the debt markets of Gulf Cooperation Council states
            after the biggest U.S. bank helped manage this month's Islamic
            bond sale by Saudi Arabia's utility. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest bond underwriter after HSBC
            Holdings Plc (HSBA) in the six-nation GCC in 2014, its best start to a
            year since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            New York-based lender advised on six deals, including Saudi
            Electricity (SECO) Co.'s $2.5 billion sukuk sale on April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Its jump from sixth place in the rankings at the end of
            2013 partly reflects the rise of Islamic finance, which will
            become a $2.7 trillion market by 2017, according to
            PricewaterhouseCoopers. Sukuk made up more than 70 percent of
            total bond issuance this year in the GCC, which supplies one-fifth of world oil, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Islamic finance now has the biggest slice of the bond
            market,' Samer Mardini, a vice president of fixed income at SJS
            Markets Ltd. in Dubai, said in a phone interview yesterday.
            'Issuers are more comfortable with big names like JPMorgan.
            They can act as market-makers and bookrunners to ensure a
            successful issuance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan hired former UBS AG banker Hussein Hassan last
            year to head global Shariah-compliant financing. It has also
            'intensified its focus on corporate clients' needs in the Gulf
            region over the past few years,' Hani Deaibes, head of Middle
            East and North Africa debt capital markets at the bank, said in
            an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rate Clarity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This effort, combined with more market certainty, has
            better positioned us to assist them in raising funding across
            the international and domestic markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;International bond-market conditions have become
            'conducive' since the start of the year as the U.S. Federal
            Reserve provided more clarity on interest rates, encouraging
            companies to raise long-term funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Electricity raised $1 billion in 30-year sukuk and
            $1.5 billion in 10-year securities. HSBC and Deutsche Bank AG
            also worked on the transaction. Deutsche Bank is the region's
            third-biggest underwriter this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The GCC has become a battleground for international banks
            as other parts of the Middle East and North Africa struggle to
            recover from political turmoil following a series of popular
            uprisings that first erupted in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Economic growth in the oil-rich Gulf region is set to
            accelerate to 4.4 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent
            for non-oil producers, according to HSBC forecasts released in
            January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sales Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's performance has come even as bond sales dropped
            almost 50 percent this year to $8 billion as some regular
            issuers, such as cash-flushed banks, refrain from tapping the
            market and offer cheaper loans to companies, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
            of Islamic structuring for UBS, is focusing on clients in
            countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
            e-mailed statement at the time of his appointment in January
            2013. Malaysia hosts the world's biggest market for Islamic
            bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts the world's biggest
            share of Shariah-compliant assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More Saudi borrowers may still issue debt after Fitch
            Ratings upgraded the kingdom one level in March to AA, the
            third-highest investment grade, according to John Sfakianakis,
            chief investment strategist at MASIC in Riyadh. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The recent sovereign upgrade should also help issuers who
            are looking for more competitive pricing,' he said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. Economic
            growth in Saudi
            Arabia may accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2014, from 3.8 percent a
            year earlier, according to economists' estimates provided to
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has helped arrange bond sales for Saudi Arabia's
            National Commercial Bank, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, Qatar
            National Bank QD, as well as Kuwait Projects Co., data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At the end of the day, it's all about being competitive
            in pricing against the rest,' Sfakianakis said. 'That's the
            only way it can be done in a market that is price sensitive.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wells Fargo Joins JPMorgan to Raise $3.5 Billion After Earnings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), the most profitable U.S. banks, are selling a
            combined $3.5 billion of debt and preferred stock after
            generating record income in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo issued $1.15 billion of five-year debt that
            pays 63 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
            offered rate and an additional $850 million of its 1.5 percent
            securities due January 2018 that yield 75 basis points more than
            similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is planning to issue $1.5 billion of perpetual
            preferred stock to yield 5.15 percent, according to a person
            familiar with that transaction who asked not to be identified,
            citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo's 2018 securities traded at 100.5 cents on the
            dollar April 11 to yield 1.4 percent, or 67 basis points more
            than Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
            system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offerings follow first-quarter earnings that relied on
            cost cuts and smaller loan-loss reserves with lending less
            lucrative. JPMorgan's net income rose 33 percent to $6.53
            billion and Wells Fargo's profit climbed 22 percent to $5.17
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Relative borrowing costs have been declining, with the
            extra yield investors demand to own bank debt instead of
            industrial company obligations narrowing to 8 basis points
            yesterday, from 103 a year ago, according to Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;China's economy will stay commodity-oriented even amid slower growth, according to JPMorgan Chase
            Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raw-material markets in the medium term will still be driven by China,Michael
            Camacho, chief executive officer of commodities for Europe, Middle East and North Africa, told the FT Global

            grows at 6 percent or 8 percent a year, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the shale-gas revolution in the
            U.S. and China's transistion to consumer-driven economy, the U.S. will become the 'next big exporter,' and
            China will be 'the next big importer' in the years to come, according to Camacho. Europe will need to find
            its place in this new order, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Cencosud Bonds Drop as JPMorgan Cites Possible Cut to Junk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cencosud SA dollar bonds fell to a
            two-week low after JPMorgan Chase Co. lowered the debt of
            Latin America's third-largest retailer to hold, saying a
            downgrade to junk would force some funds to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities due in 2023 dropped 0.47 cent to 96.38 cents
            on the dollar at 4:40 p.m. in New York, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The yield rose seven basis points, or
            0.07 percentage point, to 5.40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan reduced its recommendation on Cencosud's bonds
            maturing in 2021 and 2023 to the equivalent of hold, citing the
            possibility that Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings may
            lower their ratings on the Santiago-based company from Baa3 and
            BBB-, just one level above junk. The ratio of adjusted net debt
            to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
            is 4.1, compared with 3.5 or less for an investment-grade
            company, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is worth taking profits given the higher uncertainty
            around a potential downgrade,' JPMorgan analysts Daniela Savoia
            and Julio Arantes said in an e-mailed research note to clients.
            A rating cut below investment grade would require some funds to
            sell the securities and 'drive spread widening in the short
            term,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's total debt rose to $7.4 billion at the end of
            2012 from $1.3 billion at the end of 2006 during an acquisition
            spree in Peru, Brazil and Colombia. Total debt decreased to $5.6
            billion at the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fitch affirmed today its rating for Cencosud at BBB- and
            maintained a negative outlook, as the company's capital
            structure remains weak amid an economic slowdown in Chile and
            Brazil, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cencosud's Chief Executive Officer Daniel Rodriguez pledged
            on an April 1 conference call to sell drugstores and service
            stations, or 'noncore' assets, to reduce leverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A deal to sell a controlling stake in its credit card
            operations to Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) fell apart when the
            Brazilian bank decided to focus on a takeover of Chile's
            Corpbanca SA. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Aids U.S. Agency With Market-Based Foreign Aid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign aid has long been one of
            the most unpalatable dishes on the federal plate. Why should
            U.S. taxpayers give billions of dollars to ungrateful countries
            that will waste it and whose people don't like America anyway? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quietly, though, the U.S. Agency for International
            Development has been undergoing a market-oriented sea change
            that has attracted fans such as Amy Bell, an executive director
            of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), and hundreds of Wall Street veterans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're really showcasing the power of business to do
            well and do well in a prudent way,' said Bell, the head of
            principal investments for JPMorgan's Social Finance unit in New
            York, in a telephone interview. 'I think they've done a
            remarkable job.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government's global anti-poverty agency backs a
            private equity fund that Bell's JPMorgan unit runs for African
            agriculture businesses. It helped General Electric Co. (GE) secure
            $10 million in local financing for small maternal-health clinics
            in Kenya. It's supported loans by Root Capital, a social-investment fund, to help coffee farmers in Latin
            America supply
            Starbucks Inc. (SBUX) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's a sea change for an agency that for years simply gave
            out money. The program, called the Development Credit Authority,
            was begun in 1999 under President George W. Bush with authority
            from Congress to provide loan guarantees, but in the 10 years
            before 2011 it backed only $2.2 billion in credit. Since 2011,
            the authority has issued $1 billion in guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shrinking Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's still a fraction of the aid agency's effort. AID has
            seen its funding shrink from $22.5 billion in fiscal year 2010
            to $20.4 billion in fiscal 2014, not adjusted for inflation. The
            Obama administration has asked Congress for $20.1 billion in
            fiscal 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our developmental objectives -- ending extreme poverty in
            15 years, ending preventable child death, ending large-scale,
            widespread child hunger -- will only be achieved if we can
            effectively harness and deploy massive amounts of private
            investment against those goals,' said Rajiv Shah, the agency's
            administrator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Shah and Ben Hubbard, former director of the credit
            authority, arrived in January 2010, they saw an underutilized
            asset. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't look at these problems and say, 'How do we get
            the appropriations budget to solve this?'' Hubbard said in an
            interview. 'It's, 'How do I attract the private sector to get
            this done, because it's inherently more sustainable?' Rather
            than building and paying for solar power plants, we can attract
            private capital to pay for them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Former Bankers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency's credit authority, with a few dozen 'private
            sector, deal-oriented' former bankers and financial analysts,
            has brought tools from Wall Street to hone a model that Shah
            said he hopes will transform not only development work, but also
            the thinking in his agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the credit unit has leveraged private capital
            to help companies expand while assisting some of the world's
            most vulnerable people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The credit authority guaranteed an $8 million loan by New
            York-based JPMorgan to the African Agricultural Capital Fund,
            which helped attract equity investors and boost the Uganda-based
            fund to $25 million. The arrangement allowed the bank to
            experiment with a new market, lending to the small- and medium-sized businesses that are the engine of
            economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Republican Applause &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The private-sector approach has drawn applause from critics
            of foreign aid such as Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who's praised the credit
            agency's 'proven
            track record of significantly leveraging private financing in
            support of development aid,' even as she's called for cuts to
            other parts of the foreign aid budget. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The development credit agency works in a number of ways.
            Most often, it encourages banks in developing countries to loan
            to smaller businesses, usually in underserved sectors such as
            farming that align with U.S. development goals, by sharing the
            risk if there's a default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a lot of wealth in these banks, but they're risk-averse,' said Hubbard. 'We don't take out
            all the risk, so
            they have skin in the game, but we lower it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Nereus Capital LLC was struggling for funds, the
            credit authority partnered with U.S.-based institutional
            investors to help raise a $100 million investment in the Mumbai-based company's fund for clean-energy
            projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deploying Wealth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Learning how to deploy that wealth to tackle development
            challenges, environmental challenges in India, is how we will
            solve extreme poverty and its consequences of child hunger and
            child death there,' said Shah, 41, who earned a medical degree
            from the University of Pennsylvania and previously was chief
            scientist for the U.S. Agriculture Department and worked for the
            Bill Melinda Gates Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The credit authority's default rate has been 1.89 percent,
            with the aid agency paying out $11.6 million in claims since
            1999 and collecting $14.1 million in bank fees. It also provide
            credit enhancement to companies such as Cambridge,
            Massachusetts-based Root Capital, which identified a gap in
            financing for farmers' cooperatives that were too large for
            microcredit loans and too small for bank loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cooperatives use the funding to help small farmers
            improve their yields, reduce post-harvest losses -- enhancing
            food security -- and earn more by selling collectively to
            companies such as Seattle-based Starbucks, the world's largest
            operator of coffee shops. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Loan Guarantees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year, the president has asked Congress to raise the
            annual cap on the credit authority's loan guarantee program to
            $2 billion from $1.5 billion. It's an idea whose time had come,
            Hubbard said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, change is sometimes difficult, Shah acknowledges.
            The aid agency, created in 1961 by an executive order from
            President John F. Kennedy, has 9,421 people worldwide who are
            steeped in a culture of giving money away, not raising it. Now,
            Hubbard said, overseas missions are being held accountable to
            targets for attracting private capital to fund their programs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a huge amount of enthusiasm and excitement, and
            also resistance in any system to doing things in new and
            innovative ways,' Shah said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One solution has been to recruit Wall Street veterans to
            the government aid agency, with almost 1,000 joining since the
            end of the Bush administration, Hubbard said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reasons for signing up vary, said Hubbard, who has left the
            agency to start a firm funding businesses in Africa. 'Some lost
            their jobs because of the financial crisis and found purpose in
            our mission,' he said. 'Others could command a bigger salary
            elsewhere, they just didn't have a lot of purpose and meaning in
            those positions.' As a group, he adds, they're 'very counter-cultural inside the agency.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cairo Reality Show &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These 'field investment officers' work across the
            agency's 'silos,' Hubbard said, bringing a financial viewpoint
            to help health or agricultural specialists figure out how to
            bring private capital into their programs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chris Lee, a former energy trader from Newtown,
            Connecticut, now works as a field investment officer in Cairo,
            where he's developed a loan program for small- and medium-sized
            businesses, helps run a local reality TV show about
            entrepreneurs, and is looking at ways to support business people
            in the informal economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's amazing how simple ideas can be effective,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Looks to Uber, Seamless to Plot Mobile Future</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) digital chief
            Gavin Michael, who joined the firm a year ago, has a certain
            disdain for some competitors' staid mobile-banking apps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While functional, the apps aren't intuitive or personalized
            enough. So when it came time for the New York-based company to
            update its app, with a new iPhone version available today,
            Michael, 49, said he studied software produced by technology
            startups. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'How do I make this simple, human, cohesive? How do we
            change the principles we're chasing?' he said in an April 15
            interview. 'We looked at what a lot of the startups are doing,
            whether it's Seamless and the way I order takeout food, or Uber
            and the way I catch a cab, or OpenTable and the way I book
            restaurant reservations, or the way Apple iOS is shaped.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders including JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets, are leaning on mobile and online offerings to win
            loyalty while lowering the cost of retail services. The firm's
            mobile users rose 24 percent from a year ago to 16.4 million.
            Bank of America Corp., the No. 2 U.S. lender, said mobile
            customers increased 19 percent to 15 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael, who reports to consumer-banking chief Gordon Smith, joined JPMorgan from consulting firm
            Accenture, where he
            was head of technology innovation. He has since hired executives
            from outside finance, including Tim Parsey, a former senior vice
            president of design at Yahoo! Inc. and Josh Klenert, a former
            designer for the Huffington Post. Both are based in San
            Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior versions of the bank's mobile app for the iPhone drew
            3 1/2 out of five stars on Apple Inc.'s App Store as of late
            yesterday. Bank of America's had a similar rating. Apps from San
            Francisco-based Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and New York-based Citigroup
            Inc. both had three stars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Greetings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's redesigned app for the iPhone has a simpler
            login and location-based greetings to give users a more
            personalized experience, Michael said. The background photo
            shown to a customer in New York may feature the Brooklyn Bridge,
            for example, while a client in San Francisco sees streetcars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People work on an emotional level before they go to the
            rational level,' Michael said. 'What we're trying to do with
            banking is create that emotional experience inside the way which
            images are used, the way we greet and the way we understand how
            customers bank with us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Future versions will probably detect users' location to
            tailor their experience and ease transactions including in-store
            purchases and pulling cash from automated teller machines, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cutting Branches &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When I'm near an ATM, how do I get the two to work so I
            can preload transactions?' Michael said. 'We want a cohesive
            experience across our digital and live interactions. So things
            should work together and feel like they belong together.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mobile technology has helped firms including Charlotte,
            North Carolina-based Bank of America reduce bank branches.
            Customers 'effectively carry a branch in their pocket,' Chief
            Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, 54, said yesterday on a
            conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, branches will remain a key fixture for lenders,
            Michael said. They are evolving into places where customers seek
            financial advice, while performing routine activities like
            depositing checks with mobile phones or ATMs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It changes the relationship you have with the branch, as
            opposed to replacing it,' Michael said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Raises $1.5 Billion Offering Fixed-, Floating-Rate Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, raised $1.5 billion in an offering of two-
            year fixed- and floating-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's $1.25 billion of floating-rate securities yield
            45 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
            offered rate and its $250 million of 0.8 percent debt yields 59
            basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds may be rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service,
            according to a person familiar with the transaction, who asked
            not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
            publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $1.65 billion of 3.4 percent notes due June 2015
            traded yesterday at 105.7 cents on the dollar to yield 0.77
            percent, or 54.2 basis points over Treasuries, according to
            Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
            Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Predicts Plunge in Argentina Reserves to $37.5 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's international reserves
            will drop to $37.5 billion as capital controls erode the
            country's trade balance, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's estimate of a $5.5 billion decline in central
            bank funds this year assumes that capital controls will prevent
            a pickup in private-sector outflows. Reserves dropped to $39.8
            billion yesterday, below $40 billion for the first time since
            May 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Capital controls threaten to exert an adverse toll on
            expectations of economic performance,' JPMorgan analysts
            including New York-based Vladimir Werning wrote in an e-mailed
            research report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's merchandise trade balance will be $9.6 billion
            this year, according to JPMorgan, down from a previous estimate
            of $11.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut its 2013 'agro bonus' forecast, the
            estimated increase in agriculture-related exports, to $4.8
            billion from $6.7 billion. It projected soy crop output of 45
            million tons, down from a prior estimate of 51.5 million tons.
            The bank raised its corn output estimate for this year to 25
            million tons from 24 million tons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;YPF SA (YPFD), the oil company that the Argentine government
            seized in April 2012, was projected to import $600 million worth
            of fuel this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Barclays Seen Topping OTC Commodity Derivatives Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Barclays
            Plc (BARC) were the top firms for providing over-the-counter commodity
            derivatives to companies hedging energy and metals exposure,
            while investors favored Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), a Greenwich
            Associates survey found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays and JPMorgan, which tied for No. 1 position, had
            relationships with 39 percent of the global corporations
            surveyed about their OTC dealers to hedge energy exposure, ahead
            of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS), the survey found. JPMorgan
            also led in metals. Among investors, 59 percent said they had a
            relationship with Goldman Sachs, 54 percent named JPMorgan and
            47 percent used Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Banks are rethinking their approach to the commodities
            business in light of new capital requirements and regulations,'
            Andrew Awad, a consultant with Stamford, Connecticut-based
            researcher Greenwich Associates, said in a statement today.
            'The landscape is becoming far more fragmented, as few banks
            want to be all things to all people and more find specific
            segments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
            percent last year to $6 billion amid low volatility and client
            flows as Goldman ranked No. 1, followed by JPMorgan, according
            to a Feb. 15 report from analytics company Coalition. Increasing
            concerns about regulation and capital sensitivity also led banks
            to re-examine commodity strategies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fifty-five percent in the Greenwich survey said they used
            JPMorgan to hedge their metals exposure, while 34 percent used
            Barclays. Thirty-three percent named Citigroup and Deutsche Bank
            AG (DBK) and 26 percent said they hedged with Societe Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Ranking &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan led the ranks in energy because of its dominance
            in the U.S. and Asia, according to the survey. Barclays tied
            with Morgan Stanley for the top position in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculation about investors leaving commodities because of
            regulatory changes 'appears to be overblown,' according to
            Greenwich Associates. Investment managers will continue to use
            OTC markets for index business, while hedge funds are likely to
            move to futures over time as regulations are enforced, Awad
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
            declined to comment for this story. Greenwich Associates
            surveyed 276 corporations that hedge their energy exposure and
            98 that hedge metals, as well as 68 commodity investors that use
            OTC derivatives between September and November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Russian Stocks Drop as JPMorgan Cuts on Gazprom, Putin Policies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russian stocks retreated, erasing
            earlier gains, as OAO Gazprom (GAZP) slid after JPMorgan Chase Co.
            cited the natural gas export monopoly's dividend plans in a
            report downgrading the country's equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex Index (INDEXCF) sank as much as 1 percent and closed down
            0.1 percent at 1,336.84 in Moscow, extending last week's 3.4
            percent drop. Gazprom fell for a sixth day, retreating 0.5
            percent to 119.55 rubles as it had its longest losing streak in
            more than two months. Russian equities have the cheapest
            valuations on an estimated profit basis among 21 emerging
            markets tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia was cut to underweight from neutral at JPMorgan,
            which said Gazprom's proposed dividend cut, falling oil prices
            and 'policy stasis' in President Vladimir Putin's government
            overshadow low valuations. State-run Gazprom, Russia's largest
            company by market value, proposed this month reducing its annual
            dividend by about 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Fund manager sentiment towards Russia remains very
            brittle,' Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF
            Global Trading in London, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex Index climbed as much as 1.2 percent earlier,
            advancing with European stocks after Group of 20 nations offered
            no opposition to Japan's policy stimulus, spurring optimism that
            the measures will help boost a global recovery. Brent crude
            added 0.2 percent to $99.82 a barrel in London. Oil and gas
            contribute about 50 percent of Russia's state budget revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investor Questions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors point to low valuations on Russian stocks as a
            bull case, but they cannot really answer our questions about
            what improvements they have seen recently in the policy
            environment or the expectations of future improvements,' Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan's chief Asia and
            emerging-market strategist,
            wrote in a report dated April 20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Spot Index of commodities fell 0.1 percent to
            606.87. The dollar-denominated RTS Index (RTSI$) lost 0.6 percent to
            1,329.14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex trades at 5 times estimated earnings and has lost
            9.4 percent this year, compared with 10.6 times for the MSCI
            Emerging Markets Index (MXEF), which has slid 4.3 percent in the
            period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD) dropped 0.9 percent to
            1,531.91. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
            swings in stock futures, rose 4.8 percent to 24.47 today. The
            Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated Russian
            exchange-traded fund, declined 1 percent to 25.52, while the
            Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) declined 0.5 percent to 89.29. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Predicts Dollar Drain Worst Since '02: Argentina Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is starting to run low on dollars to pay
            the nation's bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central bank reserves fell six percent in the first
            quarter, the most for the period in six years, and sank below
            $40 billion this month for the first time since 2007. As
            investors await a U.S. court ruling on whether the nation must
            pay holdout creditors including billionaire Paul Singer from its
            2001 default, the extra yield they demand to own Argentine debt
            instead of Treasuries rose to 12 percentage points this year.
            That's almost twice the premium similarly rated Belarus and
            Ukraine pay, leaving Argentina as the only distressed borrower
            among 55 emerging markets tracked by JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drain on Argentina's reserves, which Fernandez has used
            for public spending and payments to bondholders since 2010, is
            set to accelerate as revenue growth from agricultural exports
            slows, JPMorgan estimates. Reserves will tumble at the fastest
            rate in a decade by year-end, leaving Argentina with just $37.5
            billion. That would only cover 75 percent of the country's
            foreign-currency debt obligations due from 2014, Economy
            Ministry data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What the market looks at is the country's ability to pay
            in the future,' Mariano Tavelli, president of brokerage Tavelli
            Cia., said in a phone interview from Buenos Aires. 'For now,
            we don't see a genuine stream of dollars coming in that will
            replenish the reserves we're losing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Debt Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government has made about $755 million in debt payments
            this year by drawing down central bank reserves. The treasury
            gets money from the central bank in exchange for a non-
            transferable 10-year note that pays maximum interest of the one-
            year London interbank offered rate minus one percentage point.
            Libor was at 0.715 percent on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After 2013, the government's foreign currency debt
            obligations will total $50.3 billion, excluding the $27.9
            billion in non-transferable notes sold to the central bank,
            according to the latest Economy Ministry data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Fernandez has banned most foreign-currency purchases,
            the reserve decline is prompting more Argentines to try to buy
            dollars as central bank president Mercedes Marco del Pont pumps
            pesos into the economy to keep borrowing costs low, said
            Tavelli. With a 37 percent increase in the money supply over the
            past year, the 304 billion peso ($59 billion) monetary base is
            within 2 percent of its record high on Dec. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Weakening Peso &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Expectations of a steeper decline in the peso, which will
            weaken a further 12 percent this year to 5.84 per dollar,
            according to the median estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
            Bloomberg, may tempt exporters to hoard their grain until then,
            according to Hernan Yellati, a strategist at BancTrust Co. in
            Miami. Argentines pay as much as 8.9105 pesos per dollar in a
            parallel exchange market compared to the official rate of
            5.1673. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government's revenue from export duties fell in March
            for a fourth month, declining 30 percent from a year earlier,
            the only tax segment to post a drop. Vladimir Werning, an
            economist at JPMorgan in New York, estimates exports will total
            $87.1 billion this year, an 8 percent increase from last year on
            a better harvest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to fewer dollars being sold to the central
            bank, Argentines withdrew $665 million from their dollar-
            denominated savings accounts this year, contributing to the loss
            in reserves, according to Werning. Banks deposit foreign
            currency that is not loaned to exporters in Argentina's central
            bank, so when savers make withdrawals, the central bank returns
            the cash to the bank and reserves decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Investor Attention' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The decline in gross international reserves continues to
            be a focus of investor attention,' Werning wrote in a report.
            'The time that policymakers have bought with controls has not
            been invested to resolve fundamental macro concerns, such as
            high inflation and ongoing real exchange rate appreciation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices rose 24.4 percent in March from a year earlier,
            opposition lawmakers, citing estimates from economists, said
            April 11, as the peso weakened 14.7 percent in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inflation and the peso's decline led Vale SA (VALE5), the world's
            biggest iron-ore producer, to shelve a $5.9 billion potash
            project in Argentina last month. The cost to develop the project
            almost doubled to $11 billion, while Argentina refused to give
            the Rio de Janeiro-based company any tax breaks, Chief Executive
            Officer Murilo Ferreira said on March 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'No Problem' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation's savings are also being squeezed by state-owned
            oil company YPF SA (YPFD), which will have to spend an additional $400
            million to import fuel to supply service stations after a flood
            and fire at its La Plata refinery reduced output. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, the government will have enough reserves to pay debt
            at least through 2016, according to Luis Celasco, who manages
            1.7 billion pesos of Argentina bonds at RJ Delta, a unit of
            Raymond James Financial Inc. in Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think the drop in reserves below $40 billion is a
            trigger for people to sell bonds,' Celasco said in a telephone
            interview. 'With the current picture, now that capital flight
            has decelerated because of currency controls, there's no
            problem.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost to protect $10 million of Argentine debt against
            non-payment during five years with credit-default swaps plunged
            1,037 basis points, or 10.37 percentage points, this month to
            2,072 basis points, data compiled by CMA Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
            underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails
            to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Commodity Cycle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In commodity-dependent Peru, the central bank's foreign
            currency holdings have risen eight percent this year. In Brazil,
            the world's biggest shipper of coffee and orange juice and the
            second-biggest exporter of soybeans, reserves have dropped just
            0.4 percent to $377 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're underperforming relative to what their neighbors
            are doing, so you kind of expect as a commodity producer in this
            commodity cycle, they should be doing a little bit better,'
            Gabriel Torres, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said in
            a telephone interview from New York. 'It's just purely because
            of a lack of confidence in the government.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan CMBS Deal With Sales at Post-Crisis Peak</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is marketing
            $500 million of commercial-mortgage bonds, capping what probably
            will be the busiest month in the $550 billion market in more
            than five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender plans to issue securities linked to 82
            properties spanning the U.S. from California to Kentucky,
            according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not
            to be identified because terms aren't public. Hotel loans
            account for 64.2 percent of the deal, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of bonds tied to commercial real estate in April
            is poised to surpass the $8.3 billion sold in January, which
            marked the highest monthly volume since December 2007, according
            to JPMorgan. Volume was $6.9 billion through April 19, the bank
            said. Investors are reversing course after pulling back amid the
            glut of offerings, debt analysts at New York-based JPMorgan said
            in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'After some weakness to start the month, pricing spreads
            have begun to snap back despite the uptick in supply,' the
            analysts led by Ed Reardon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc sold
            top-ranked securities maturing in about 10 years to yield 81
            basis points, or 0.81 percentage point, more than the benchmark
            swap rate on April 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            That compares with 85 basis points on similar debt issued by the
            lenders on March 6, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Risk Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for riskier portions of the deals is building. Wells
            Fargo and RBS sold bonds rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
            ranking, to pay a spread of 310 basis points more than swaps
            this month, compared with 375 basis points in March, people
            familiar with the transaction said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are buying the bonds as the Federal Reserve's
            effort to stimulate economic growth by suppressing borrowing
            costs pushes investors toward riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Insurance companies boosted purchases of lower-ranking
            commercial-mortgage debt this year by nine percentage points,
            accounting for 33 percent of subordinate debt purchases from new
            deals, the JPMorgan analysts said in a separate report on April
            12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of commercial-mortgage bonds is poised to climb 50
            percent to $70 billion in 2013, according to Credit Suisse Group
            AG. Banks have arranged about $28.6 billion in sales this year,
            Bloomberg data show. A record $232 billion was issued in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UBS Joins JPMorgan in Lowering Deutsche Bank on Capital</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) joined JPMorgan Chase Co. in recommending investors stop buying shares in Deutsche
            Bank AG, saying the company may delay efforts to cut costs and build capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;UBS cut
            Deutsche Bank to neutral from buy and lowered its price estimate for Deutsche Bank's shares to 33 euros from
            47 euros, analysts including Daniele Brupbacher and Mate Nemes in Zurich said in an e-mailed report today.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is contending with a global slowdown in trading revenue as clients hold
            off investing amid uncertainty over monetary policy and geopolitical crises. The company is among banks that
            have shrunk assets to allay investor concern about capital levels and to meet stricter regulatory
            requirements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The weaker than expected year-to-date revenue environment is particularly
            relevant for Deutsche Bank,' UBS said. 'In order to protect the bottom line, Deutsche could push out the
            non-core clean-up as well as restructuring by about one year.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christian Streckert, a
            spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank, declined to comment on the UBS report by telephone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 0.3 percent to 31.98 euros at 11:41 a.m. in Frankfurt. Before the UBS downgrade,
            twenty-one of 45 analysts recommended buying Deutsche Bank's shares with 17 saying hold and seven saying
            sell, according to Bloomberg data. The average price estimate was 41.3 euros. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former JPMorgan Banker Ian Hannam Joins Strand Partners</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, the former JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) banker advising mining companies, has joined
            corporate-advisory firm Strand Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, 57, started with Strand Partners this month,
            according to the Financial Services Register records. His
            private firm Elgin Partners has bought Strand Partners,
            according to Financial News, which reported the story earlier.
            Hannam declined to comment when contacted by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, a former JPMorgan chairman of equity-capital
            markets, stepped down in April last year to appeal a decision by
            the U.K.'s financial-services regulator to fine him 450,000
            pounds ($686,000) for market abuse. He e-mailed a potential
            customer in 2008 with details of a bid for his client Heritage
            Oil Plc (HOIL), as well as news of an oil find, it said at the time.
            Hannam said in a statement then he would appeal and planned to
            continue his financial career after the dispute is over. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Based in London, Hannam was among bankers advising Xstrata
            Plc (XTA), the subject of a bid by Glencore International Plc (GLEN) last
            year. At JPMorgan, which also served as a broker to Xstrata,
            Hannam helped the mining company first sell shares in 2002, and
            was involved in many of its subsequent transactions, including
            the $18.1 billion purchase of the Canadian nickel producer
            Falconbridge Ltd. in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Latam Airlines Gains in Chile After JPMorgan Removes Sell</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Latam Airlines SA (LAN), Latin America's
            worst-performing carrier this year, rose to a four-week high as
            JPMorgan Chase Co. raised its recommendation on the stock from
            the equivalent of sell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Latam advanced 1.7 percent to 10,300 pesos at 12:13 p.m. in
            Santiago, the highest price since March 27 on a closing basis.
            The benchmark Ipsa index increased 0.4 percent. The airline's
            American depositary receipts gained 1.2 percent to $21.53. Both
            the Chilean shares and ADRs fell 10 percent this year through
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan increased its rating to the equivalent of hold,
            saying the stock's drop in 2013 gives it room to rise toward the
            bank's target price, analysts Fernando Abdalla, Jamie Baker and
            Carlos Louro wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. They forecast
            that the ADR's will reach $25 by December. Latam was formed last
            year from Lan Airlines SA's $3.3 billion takeover of Brazil's
            Tam SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We still believe that the current valuation premium to
            its Latin American peers is a bit excessive due to execution
            risks related to the Lan/Tam integration,' the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Latam's enterprise value trades at 12.5 times earnings
            before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and rentals, or
            Ebitdar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ratio is
            67 percent higher than the average of five Latin American
            airlines. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Japanese Pensions Selling JGBs on Abe's Stimulus, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese pensions are selling
            domestic bonds as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to spur
            inflation stoke concern rising interest rates will erode the
            value of their holdings, a JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Retirement funds held 29 percent of their assets in
            Japanese bonds at the end of March, down from about 31 percent
            the previous year, a survey by JPMorgan's Tokyo-based asset
            management unit showed. Alternative asset holdings including
            hedge funds increased 2.3 percentage points to 11.8 percent,
            according to the survey, which was based on 128 pension plans
            overseeing a total 11.7 trillion yen ($117 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese pension funds, which have traditionally invested
            mainly in bonds, are seeking other assets to maintain steady
            returns and fund retiree benefits in the world's most rapidly
            aging society. The country's public pension fund and insurers
            including Nippon Life Insurance Co. plan to cut their JGB
            holdings after Abe's called for unlimited money printing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Abenomics is changing their attitude toward risk,' said
            Hidenori Suzuki, the head of the strategic advisory group at
            JPMorgan Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. in Tokyo. 'It's become
            clear that pension funds are reducing domestic bond holdings and
            adding assets with higher returns such as foreign bonds and
            alternative investments, as they become more concerned about
            interest rate increases from monetary easing measures.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Currency Hedges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Expectations for action by Abe's administration and the BOJ
            have led the Topix index of shares to rally 61 percent and the
            yen to slump 24 percent against the dollar in the past five
            months. The yield on Japan's 10-year government bonds will rise
            to 0.92 percent by September 2014 from 0.595 percent as
            inflation picks up, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pension funds are also planning to raise infrastructure
            investments, while increasing foreign exchange hedging, the
            survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Government Pension Investment Fund, one of the biggest
            buyers of JGBs, said in February that it may reduce its holdings
            of the bonds and buy more emerging market stocks and alternative
            assets on concern Abe's policies will reduce its returns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nippon Life Insurance, Japan's biggest life insurer, said
            earlier this week it may buy more foreign debt and cut holdings
            of long-term domestic securities if yields in Japan stay low. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, sold $2 billion of 10-year subordinated
            debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank issued the 3.375 percent notes due May 2023 to
            yield 175 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They may be rated A3 by
            Moody's Investors Service, said a person familiar with the
            offering, who asked not to be identified because the terms
            weren't set at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering will be used for general

        <headline>Raymond James Beats JPMorgan as Best Brokerage: Riskless Return</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Raymond James Financial Inc., the
            brokerage that posted profits for 100 straight quarters, is
            showing investors that simplicity is key to generating gains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With headquarters 1,200 miles from Wall Street, the St.
            Petersburg, Florida-based company produced the best risk-
            adjusted return of nine U.S. brokerages, banks and advisory
            firms since 2009, the BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows.
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, ranked third as
            Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) were among the worst performers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors compare Raymond James, which has a business model
            that's easy to grasp and shields the balance sheet from risk, to
            an asset manager as it mainly relies on fees. Unlike larger
            rivals, the brokerage gets most of its sales managing investor
            money, earning 64 percent of annual revenue in the last fiscal
            year from its private-client group. That gave Raymond James the
            stability to weather a financial crisis that caused larger banks
            to write off billions of dollars in loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You threw everything but the kitchen sink at the
            financial-services industry and this company sailed through
            rather successfully,' said Dan Veru, chief investment officer
            at Palisade Capital Management LLC, which owns Raymond James
            shares and manages $3.8 billion. 'That largeness that used to
            be an advantage, I don't think it's such an advantage anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Braskem SA, Latin America's largest
            petrochemicals maker, rose to a two-year high as Citigroup Inc. (C)
            and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) recommended buying the stock after the
            government cut taxes for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares gained 3.2 percent to 16.70 reais at 1:38 p.m. in
            Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since
            September 2011. The Ibovespa stock benchmark added 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government temporarily reduced a tax on raw
            materials used in the chemical industry to 1 percent from 5.6
            percent, effective May 1. The levy will be gradually restored
            through 2018, Finance Minister Guido Mantega told reporters in
            Brasilia yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The change should boost Braskem's earnings excluding
            interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 650 million
            reais ($321 million) this year, according to Citigroup, which
            raised its recommendation from sell. JPMorgan analysts Caio Carvalhal and Felipe dos Santos lifted their
            rating from hold,
            citing a benefit from the tax stimulus that 'is not fully
            priced into Braskem shares, leaving room for further upside,'
            according to a research note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Sao Paulo-based company's Ebitda fell to 3.5 billion
            reais in 2012 from 3.6 billion reais in 2011, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. The shares have gained 30 percent this year,
            while the Ibovespa declined 9.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

            unit for $3.5 billion, reported the largest increase in annual
            revenue among big closely held commodity-trading houses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria's 2013 revenue rose 14 percent to $112 billion,
            according to an update on the Geneva-based company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That beats a 10 percent increase to $133 billion reported
            by Trafigura Beheer BV for its fiscal year ended Sept. 30.
            Annual revenue at Vitol Group, the world's largest independent
            oil trader, rose 1.3 percent to $307 billion, the company said
            last month. Gunvor Group Ltd. said last week that 2013 sales
            fell to $91 billion from $93 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The results show Mercuria, which was founded in 2004 by
            former Goldman Sachs (GS) traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, is
            growing its trading business faster than competitors. In the
            past three years, revenue has more than doubled as Mercuria
            expanded beyond oil into metals, concentrates and agricultural
            commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's 2013 trading volumes rose 7 percent from a
            year earlier to 195 million metric tons of oil or oil
            equivalent, the company said on the website. Mercuria didn't
            disclose a profit figure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income in 2012 was $343 million, according to a copy of
            the company's consolidated financial statements obtained by
            Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Staff &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gunvor, which is also expanding into non-oil commodities,
            said April 16 that its 2013 net income rose to $308 million from
            $301 million the year before as trading margins improved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2013, Mercuria hired 570 people, including
            executives from investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and
            Barclays Plc. That boosted staff to 1,200 from about 10 in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After agreeing to purchase JPMorgan's unit on March 19,
            Mercuria is now deciding which employees will be offered
            positions. The unit has about 500 staff. Blythe Masters, the
            head of the bank's global commodities operations, will leave
            once the sale is completed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit will give Mercuria gas and power trading
            operations on both sides of the Atlantic, physical assets
            spanning 40 locations in North America, an oil-trading book with
            a supply and offtake contract at the largest refinery on the
            U.S. East Coast, and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the
            Canadian oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Help Oversee $12 Billion for Resolution Life</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) won a contract
            to help manage about $12 billion in bonds for Resolution Life
            Holdings Inc., a startup insurer that plans to acquire policies
            from other U.S. carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The partnership represents a comprehensive investment
            management relationship that includes fixed-income portfolio
            management, asset-liability management and product hedging,'
            according to a statement today from Resolution. It will also
            cover 'asset-allocation strategy and investment accounting and
            reporting support.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Resolution said last month that it plans to initially
            invest $2 billion to build a "lasting, sizable and
            differentiated" insurance company in the U.S. comprised of
            businesses that are no longer adding new clients. The
            announcement followed its agreement to buy Lincoln Benefit Life
            from Allstate Corp. (ALL) in July. Insurers including Hartford
            Financial Services Group Inc. have been looking to sell U.S.
            life operations as low interest rates pinch profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Resolution Chairman Clive Cowdery pursued a similar
            strategy in the U.K., where he amassed a personal fortune
            consolidating the industry. Over the last decade, his Resolution
            Group bought 25 insurers, comprising more than 10 million
            policyholders and $200 billion in policy assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money managers including New York-based JPMorgan, BlackRock
            Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been vying to win
            contracts with insurance clients to boost fee income. Insurers
            have sought Wall Street investment expertise to diversify their
            portfolios and meet regulatory requirements. Outsourcing also
            allows the insurers to focus on underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said March 31 that its Highbridge Principal
            Strategies LLC will manage funds for Watford Re Ltd., a Bermuda-based reinsurer. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) has named
            Christopher Conoscenti a managing director in its oil and gas
            group, as the investment bank builds up its energy team in the
            Americas, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Conoscenti, who was previously at JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            will join Credit Suisse's Houston office in July reporting to
            Tim Perry and Brian McCabe, co-heads its oil and gas team for
            the Americas, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Credit Suisse spokesman confirmed the contents of the
            memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Conoscenti, who focuses on mergers involving U.S.
            exploration companies, first joined JPMorgan in 2001, according
            to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He helped advise
            Concho Resources (CXO) Inc. on its purchase of Three Rivers Operating
            Co.'s oil and gas assets in 2012, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in December hired McCabe, a pipeline merger
            specialist, from Morgan Stanley to help run its Americas oil and
            gas group. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Spanish Bond Gains as Liquidity Fuels Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish and Italian bonds are
            poised to extend gains as a recovery in liquidity lures
            international investors back to the markets they fled during
            Europe's debt crisis, JPMorgan Chase Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The periphery's performance has been very strong this
            year and we still expect to see more,' said Carl Norrey, the
            head of European rates securities at JPMorgan Chase and Co. in
            London in an interview on April 22. 'Lower yields, less
            volatility, tighter bid-offer spreads and more turnover breed
            confidence.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish bonds have returned 21 percent since European
            Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged on July 26 to do
            'whatever it takes' to safeguard the monetary union, according
            to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
            Financial Analysts Societies. Italy's bonds gained 16 percent.
            The nation's two-year note yield dropped to a record low on
            April 23 as it moved closer to appointing a new government after
            inconclusive elections two months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gap between the yield at which traders say they will
            buy and sell Spain's benchmark 10-year bond narrowed to less
            than two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, this week from
            more than 12 basis points in June 2012, according to closing-
            market data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average daily trading of Spanish government bonds increased
            to 44 billion euros ($57 billion) in February from 36 billion
            euros in December, according to data from Spain's Treasury. The
            share of securities held by overseas investors rose to 37.9
            percent, from 33.5 percent in August. In 2011 it was more than
            50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Conviction Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spain's 10-year bond yield is headed for an eighth-straight
            monthly decline, falling to 4.28 percent at 4:12 p.m. London
            time today from 6.86 percent at the end of August. Italy's 10-
            year yield was at 4.07 percent today, from 5.85 percent on Aug.
            31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It feels like the market is caught between respecting
            that performance and not having huge conviction to necessarily
            go long Italy or Spain,' said Norrey, referring to a bet that
            the price of the securities will rise. 'If you have a
            resolution to a grand coalition in Italy in coming days, I see
            no reason why we can't end up having Italian yields at 3.50
            percent to 3.75 percent in the next two-to-three weeks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Italy's prime minister-designate Enrico Letta met
            representatives from various political parties yesterday in a
            bid to form a government. The country is still without a new
            government after elections in February failed to produce a
            conclusive result. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Italian government bonds fell for a third day today after a
            rally that took the 10-year yield below 4 percent for the first
            time since November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market has a lot of momentum and every time this year
            when there's been a selloff in peripheral bonds, losses have
            been reversed within a week,' Norrey said. 'Over the last few
            years, a lot of people have tried to have a maximum short
            position in the periphery because they thought the euro zone
            would fall apart,' he said, referring to bets the bonds would
            drop. 'It hasn't happened and investors got hurt.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold the first
            structured notes tied to Hong Kong's largest property trust in
            more than 15 months, as rising rents in the city fuel gains in
            real estate investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank on April 3 sold HK$4.5 million ($580,000) of
            securities tied to The Link (823) Real Estate Investment Trust, Hong
            Kong's biggest REIT, and Wharf Holdings Ltd., the owner of the
            Times Square and Harbour City malls, according to an e-mail from
            the lender's staff handling structured products in the city. The
            product pays monthly coupons for days when the prices of the two
            underlying assets remain in certain ranges, according to the e-
            mailed response to queries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Link REIT, which owns and manages shopping centers and
            parking spaces, and Wharf (4) both rose to all-time highs this
            month. Average Hong Kong rents for prime shopping locations may
            rise 8 percent this year, according to property broker CBRE
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Polly Leung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on why the bank chose to link the notes to
            the property investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc had last issued notes tied to the Link
            REIT, along with other stocks, in December 2011, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>LightSquared Plan to Benefit JPMorgan, Ergen Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;LightSquared Inc.'s plan to
            reorganize will improperly benefit lenders including JPMorgan
            Chase Co., which will own all of the wireless-spectrum
            company's assets after bankruptcy, Dish Network Corp. (DISH) Chairman
            Charles Ergen said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plan was devised in talks where LightSquared's
            controlling shareholder, Philip Falcone, 'made it clear that he
            was interested in using the plan to enrich himself and equity
            holders,' Ergen said yesterday in a bankruptcy court filing in
            Manhattan. Falcone stated that he wanted to protect three
            parties: his investment firm Harbinger Capital Partners LLC,
            Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) and JPMorgan, Ergen said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP Special Opportunities Inc., an Ergen fund that invested
            $1 billion in LightSquared debt, made the allegations following
            an eight-day trial on whether LightSquared can reorganize under
            a plan that puts Ergen's debt behind other lenders and equity
            holders to be repaid. In yesterday's filing, the fund dissected
            how much JPMorgan, Fortress, Harbinger and another investor,
            Melody Capital Advisors LLC, stand to benefit compared with what
            money they put at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Falcone made it clear in numerous e-mails that the
            primary purpose of the plan and its subordination or
            disallowance of SPSO's claims was to enrich Mr. Falcone and
            Harbinger,' Ergen said. Closing arguments in the trial are
            planned for May 5 and 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Falcone has said he had a fiduciary duty to advocate for
            Harbinger's investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Affiliate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) affiliate SIG Holdings Inc. currently holds all of
            LightSquared's series B preferred stock. The New York-based bank
            also has put $360 million into LightSquared through operating
            loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investments may be worth 'hundreds of millions of
            dollars,' and JPMorgan will own all of LightSquared's equity
            and assets after the bankruptcy, Ergen said. JPMorgan also may
            benefit from LightSquared tax-loss benefits estimated at more
            than $2 billion, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LightSquared, based in Reston, Virginia, sought court
            protection after the Federal Communications Commission blocked
            the company's wireless service, saying it might interfere with
            global-positioning-system navigation equipment. The company
            listed assets of $4.48 billion and debt of $2.29 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Junk-Bond Skeptics Squeezed as JPMorgan Sees Tears in '15</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;It's a painful time to be a junk-bond skeptic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may seem inevitable that the
            riskiest corporate debt will lose value, since investors are getting paid about the least ever to own such
            bonds. Yet after bearish wagers on the biggest junk-bond exchange-traded funds surged to a record last
            month, the market just keeps on rallying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Will the search for yield come to tears?'
            JPMorgan Chase Co. strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote in an April 25 report. 'Eventually, yes.' But not, at
            least, until probably next year, according to the strategists, who are sticking to a positive outlook for
            now on U.S. speculative-grade debt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The volume of borrowed shares -- usually used for
            short selling -- on BlackRock Inc.'s $13.3 billion ETF (HYG) soared to an all-time high of almost $3.6
            billion on March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For State Street Corp.'s similar fund, the
            bets approached $1.3 billion, also a record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How did the market respond? BlackRock's ETF
            has gained 0.3 percent this month, while State Street's (JNK) is up 0.4 percent. Yields on the debt as
            measured by a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index dropped to 6.02 percent, about the same rate buyers were
            paid to own 10-year Treasuries (USGG10YR) during the past three decades. Investors have since pared their
            bearish ETF wagers a bit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hating Junk &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aversion to the market was
            on display at a hedge-fund conference last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We hate high-yield -- we're actually
            short high-yield,' Andrew Rabinowitz, Marathon Asset Management LP's chief operating officer, said March 19
            on a panel at the Absolute Return Symposium 2014 in New York. 'It's trading at dangerous levels.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DoubleLine Capital LP's Jeffrey Gundlach trimmed allocations to the debt earlier this year, saying
            last month that 'if they start to suffer losses, you really wonder who's going to buy them.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
            investors have learned over the past five years, it hasn't paid to fight Federal Reserve stimulus, which is
            still supporting values that by any historical measure seem expensive. There's a growing sense that the tide
            will turn. Many are losing confidence that the time is now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Lender Curbs Daily Risk in Triparty Repos</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), one of two
            banks that dominate clearing in the $1.8 trillion tri-party
            repurchase agreement market, said it curtailed daily credit risk
            that regulators blamed for fueling the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All clients have been moved to a system that includes
            rolling settlement, simultaneous exchange of cash and collateral
            and creation of a secured committed clearance advance facility,
            JPMorgan said today in a statement. Collectively, the changes
            provide the bank with more protection against losses while
            reducing the need of Wall Street dealers for intraday loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has been urging JPMorgan and Bank of
            New York Mellon Corp. to speed improvements in repo markets,
            which are used by the Fed's primary dealers for short-term
            funding. The system neared collapse in 2008 amid the demise of
            Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Bankers had
            pledged to finish upgrades by 2016, prompting the Fed to say
            industry-led efforts were too slow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Every new piece of functionality introduced over the last
            four years has allowed us to reduce materially the systemic risk
            previously created by over-reliance on clearing-bank credit,'
            Michael Albanese, head of JPMorgan's U.S. tri-party repo
            clearing and collateral management, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon, the industry leader, and JPMorgan act as
            middlemen to process repo transactions and keep charge of
            collateral. The role required the two New York-based banks to
            temporarily extend hundreds of billions of dollars in credit for
            several hours during the day, which puts their safety at risk if
            the market breaks down before the deals are unwound. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Curbing Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed's goal was to curb the need for the lenders to
            finance the deals, people familiar with the plans have said. The
            market is the biggest source of financing for primary dealers,
            the 22 firms that act as counterparties for the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon is 'fully on track for practically eliminating
            intraday credit risk this year and enabling market participants
            to continue to efficiently and effectively fund their
            operations,' Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the company, said in
            an e-mailed statement. The lender, which handles about 80
            percent of the transactions, expects to have the final pieces of
            its upgrade in place by the end of this year, according to the
            firm's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman during 2008, told the
            Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that a breakdown of the tri-party market in 2008 almost created a 'black
            hole' as
            financial firms lost access to cash for daily operations. The
            commission in a report cited structural flaws in the market as
            one of the biggest causes of the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Washington
            Mutual Inc. and Citigroup Inc. (C) were sued by Integer Program LLC
            over $301 million in losses from mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Integer claimed that the banks breached a 2007 mortgage
            loan purchase agreement, according to the suit filed April 26 in
            New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual securitized more than 4,600 residential
            mortgage loans that were eventually sold to Integer, according
            to the complaint. The alleged breaches occurred on more than
            1,400 loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over 60 mortgage loans were delinquent as of the
            applicable cut-off date and/or the date of the closing of the
            offering of the certificates to the public,' Integer said in a
            court filing. 'These breaches have not been remedied by the
            responsible parties.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Integer Program LLC v. JPMorgan Chase Bank
            North America, 651518/2013, Supreme Court of the State of New
            York, County of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Rakesh Patel and Cathrin Petty will continue to run

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Werning Head of Latin America Research</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. named
            Argentine economist Vladimir Werning as the head of Latin
            America research amid a leadership overhaul in the global
            banking division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Werning will replace and report to Luis Oganes, who was
            promoted earlier this month to global head of emerging-markets
            research, according to bank spokeswoman Veronica Navarro Espinosa. Oganes, who will move to London in
            August, succeeded
            Joyce Chang after she was named global head of research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Benjamin Ramsey, Franco Uccelli, Gabriel Lozano and Iker Cabiedes will keep their current
            responsibilities as Latin
            America economists and report to Werning, who will continue to
            cover the economies and fixed-income markets of Argentina and

            &lt;p&gt;Werning started as an economist at JPMorgan's Buenos Aires
            office in the late 1990s after teaching at Torcuato Di Tella

            &lt;p&gt;The promotions come after JPMorgan's corporate and

            in a memo April 7 including the promotion of Carlos Hernandez
            and Jeff Urwin to co-heads of global banking. Chang succeeded
            Tom Schmidt, who asked for a new role earlier this year,

        <headline>JPMorgan, BlackRock Differ From Rio CEO Walsh on Returns</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive
            Officer Sam Walsh last week signaled that mining investor
            attitudes toward spending on expansion are starting to shift
            after a recovery in metals and share prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have started to refocus on growth and expansion
            plans rather than concentrating only on returns, Walsh, 64, said
            at an industry event in Perth, Australia last week. Mining
            companies should retain their focus on giving back excess cash
            to shareholders and shy away from mergers and acquisitions, two
            of the industry's largest investors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It does seem slightly baffling for him to have come out
            with that statement so early on really,' James Sutton, a
            portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management's $1.9 billion
            Natural Resources Fund in London, said today in a phone
            interview. 'In terms of the worst culprits of capital ill
            discipline, I don't think they're off the leash yet.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mining companies have been reining in spending after a $250
            billion investment spree marked by poorly timed acquisitions and
            asset writedowns sparked investor criticism. As a decade-long
            boom in metal prices petered out, producers have focused on
            preserving capital and bolstering dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you look at investors globally, there was certainly a
            time when global investors were more focused on returns,' Walsh
            said. 'Since the beginning of this year, we've actually seen a
            shift. I think it's far more balanced; that we've now got
            investors refocused on growth, expansion, as well as shareholder
            returns.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Damaging Strategies' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Walsh replaced Tom Albanese at the head of the world's
            second-largest mining company in January last year following
            failed deals in coal and aluminum. He cut $2.3 billion from
            costs last year and is seeking to a further reduction of $1
            billion this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc.'s Evy Hambro, who manages the $8 billion
            World Mining Fund, said mining CEOs should maintain their
            commitment to rewarding investors. Rio is the fourth-largest
            holding in Hambro's Fund at 7.7 percent. The 101-member
            Bloomberg World Mining Index advanced 5.4 percent in July to
            reach the highest monthly close in 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the recent strength in the sector, the market is
            starting to acknowledge managements' focus on returns for
            shareholders,' Hambro said in e-mailed comments yesterday. 'It
            would be foolish for the executives and boards to put this
            nascent recovery at risk by reverting back to the damaging
            strategies of the last cycle.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A London-based spokesman for Rio declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shareholders Important &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's been no change of strategy at Rio, Walsh said at
            last week's event. The company raised its dividend 15 percent in
            February after reporting a 43 percent gain in second-half
            profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Shareholder returns are very important to me and to the
            company,' he said. 'That's why we're in business: to provide
            returns to our shareholders. We should never lose sight of that.
            But it's also, you know, long-term shareholders as well as
            short-term shareholders. We need to get that balance right.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts widely expect BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio to
            announce share buybacks in the next six months. Macquarie Group
            Ltd. analysts have said they're 'not convinced a buyback is due
            or that it would be a responsible use of funds' for BHP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto this week drew a line under one of its most
            disastrous deals by selling its Mozambique coal assets for $50
            million. The company bought the projects as part of a $3.7
            billion purchase of Riversdale Mining Ltd. in 2011 before
            writing them down by $3 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think that the large-cap mining companies have
            got the mandate from the generalist investor to go on an
            acquisition spree any time soon,' JPMorgan's Sutton said.
            'They always have to consider their pipeline and to consider
            the reserve lives of their various commodity exposures. So it
            can't carry on indefinitely, this halt to capex and
            acquisitions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Natural Resources has Rio as its fifth-largest
            holding, with a 4.6 percent weighting. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Take Profits on Bets Against U.S. 10-Year Notes, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should take profits on bets
            that Treasury 10-year notes would fall, based on trading patterns
            and amid signs the economy is improving more slowly than
            projected, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on the benchmark notes rose three basis points last
            week, or 0.03 percentage point. A daily jump on July 30 that
            followed a stronger-than-estimated reading on gross domestic
            product was pared by a drop on Aug. 1 following a weaker-than-forecast U.S. jobs report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields have increased in the week before the
            monthly employment data 'in a well-defined intra-month
            pattern,' only to fall an average 11 basis points in the three
            weeks after the report, JPMorgan analysts including Jay Barry,
            Devdeep Sarkar and Bruce Sun in New York wrote in a client note
            Aug. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We find nothing to dislodge this cyclical pattern over
            the near term,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ten-year (USGG10YR) yields were little changed at 2.49 percent today
            in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yields fell seven basis points Aug. 1 after the Labor
            Department reported U.S. employers added 209,000 jobs in July,
            versus a 230,000 gain forecast by economists in a Bloomberg
            survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy grew at a 4 percent annualized rate in the
            second quarter, Commerce Department data showed on July 30. A
            separate Bloomberg survey forecast a 3 percent rise. Ten-year
            yields climbed 10 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Top Retail Banking Lawyer Biben Said to Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Matthew Biben, general counsel for
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s retail-banking operations, has left after
            three years at the firm, a person with knowledge of the move
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jill Centella, global litigation head for the New York-based lender, was named acting general
            counsel for consumer and
            community banking in June, said the person, who requested
            anonymity because the information hasn't been made public.
            JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Biben managed more than 425 lawyers and helped negotiate
            JPMorgan's share of the industry's $25 billion foreclosure
            settlement in 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile. The
            firm's retail division had $21.9 billion in revenue in the first
            six months of 2014, the most of the bank's four main businesses,
            according to a financial statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
            comment. Biben didn't immediately return a telephone message or
            e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Biben earlier spent 12 years working for the government,
            including the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District
            of New York and the New York County District Attorney's Office,
            according to his profile. He graduated from Cornell University
            in 1989 and the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He joined Bank of New York Mellon Corp. as a deputy general
            counsel in 2004 and was hired by JPMorgan in 2011 as its lead

        <headline>Mortgage Trustees Seek $4.5 Billion JPMorgan Accord Approval</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond trustees including U.S.
            Bank N.A. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. asked a New York
            state court judge to approve a $4.5 billion settlement with
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) over investor claims of faulty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan made an offer to the trustees in November to
            settle claims relating to the underwriting and servicing of
            loans in 330 residential mortgage securitization trusts, as well
            as claims over document delivery, according to a petition filed
            yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer was negotiated by New York-based JPMorgan and a
            group of 21 institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc.
            and Pacific Investment Management Co., that held more than $24
            billion, or 32 percent of the securities issued by the trusts,
            according to the petition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord is being declined by trustees for five of the
            trusts and part of another, according to a notice posted online
            last week. The lack of a more sweeping approval may leave the
            bank exposed to a larger payout. The deadline for accepting the
            proposed settlement has been pushed back several times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan negotiated the agreement in a bid to move past
            lawsuits tied in part to the housing crisis. The accord was
            announced the week before the largest U.S. bank agreed to a
            record $13 billion settlement with government agencies over
            faulty mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were central to
            the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the worst
            recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed and the
            market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In the matter of the application of U.S. Bank
            National Association, 652382/2014, New York State Supreme Court,
            New York County (Manhattan) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys UBS's OTC Commodity Derivatives Portfolio</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which said last
            month it plans to get out of the business of owning and trading
            physical commodities from metals to oil, bought the over-the-counter commodity derivatives portfolio of UBS
            AG (UBSN), which is
            exiting most of its raw-materials trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction includes on-exchange hedge positions and
            excludes precious metals and index-based products, UBS said in
            an e-mailed statement today. JPMorgan assumed market risk on the
            portfolio and the two banks 'will work together in the coming
            months with their clients to fully assign contracts for
            individual trades to JPMorgan,' according to the statement.
            JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are scaling back or exiting their commodities
            operations amid regulatory scrutiny and lower profits from raw
            materials. Revenue in commodities at the 10 largest investment
            banks fell 25 percent in the first half of the year, analytics
            company Coalition said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last month that it's considering an exit from
            the business of trading physical commodities, marking a reversal
            of its push into raw materials with its 2010 purchase of parts
            of RBS Sempra, a joint venture between Royal Bank of Scotland
            Group Plc and Sempra Energy. (SRE) UBS and JPMorgan didn't report the
            price of the transaction reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zurich-based UBS, Switzerland's biggest lender, last year
            decided to close its oil, base metals and agriculture trading
            desks, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said Oct.
            31. The bank is keeping its index-investor products and precious
            metals trading. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Emerging Markets Equities Banker McCulloch Quits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gordon McCulloch resigned as a
            managing director of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s European emerging
            markets equity unit after more than four years at the U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McCulloch, a Russia specialist, departed last month after
            joining JPMorgan in January 2010 from Moscow brokerage
            Renaissance Capital, where he was deputy chief executive
            officer. He was previously managing director at Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (G) in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I will be back in a role in due course,' London-based
            McCulloch said in an e-mailed response to questions. 'I am
            taking some time out with the family now.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London,
            declined to comment by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Russia's equities head Vladimir Bril and the
            equity sales head Alexey Kaminsky departed last month amid a
            round of job cuts, people with knowledge of the matter have
            said. The bank, which opened a representative office in Moscow
            in 1973, cut some jobs in equity trading and equity research in
            the Russian capital, said a third person. McCulloch said his
            departure wasn't related to Moscow job cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equity and debt markets have seized up for Russian issuers
            since the annexation of Crimea earlier this year led to
            sanctions from the U.S. and the European Union against companies
            and Vladimir Putin's inner circle. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. investment banks in Moscow, led by JPMorgan, Citigroup
            Inc. and Morgan Stanley (MS), earned $54 million in fees from
            advising on mergers and underwriting in the year to July 27,
            down 56 percent from a year earlier, according to data compiled
            by Freeman Co., a New York-based consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Wins Dismissal of Los Angeles Bias Lending Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. won dismissal of
            claims by Los Angeles accusing the bank's Washington Mutual unit
            of targeting minority borrowers with predatory loans, while a
            judge said the allegations could be refiled against the parent
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles ruled that
            while claims related to Washington Mutual Inc. were barred, the
            city could revise the lawsuit to focus on Chase's lending
            practices during and after JPMorgan bought WaMu in 2008. The
            city lumped Chase and WaMu loan information together in the
            original complaint and has 21 days to refile the lawsuit
            focusing on non-WaMu loans, Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of at least four filed by Los Angeles
            against banks for allegedly flooding minority neighborhoods with
            subprime mortgages even when residents qualified for better
            terms. The city alleged the subprime loans drove up the number
            of foreclosures in the city. Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) lost a court bid
            in May to dismiss a similar case brought by Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Los Angeles and other cities have explored legal means to
            hold banks accountable for urban blight in the wake of the 2008
            collapse of the U.S. housing market and financial crisis.
            Homeowners in Los Angeles lost about $78.8 billion in home value
            as the result of 200,000 foreclosures from 2008 through 2012,
            the city said last year, citing a report by Alliance of
            Californians for Community Empowerment and the California
            Reinvestment Coalition. The lost property tax revenue to the
            city has been $481 million, according to the complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased with this decision, and we will continue
            to carry out our strong commitment to Los Angeles residents,'
            Suzanne Ryan, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, said in
            an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Attorney
            Michael Feuer, said the city is weighing whether to appeal the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the meantime we are aggressively pursuing our claims
            against JPMorgan Chase,' he said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is City of Los Angeles v. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM),
            14-cv-04168, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
            (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Fund Choices for Clients Said Under SEC Review</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
            Commission is reviewing whether conflicts of interest led
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to sell certain investment products to
            individual clients, according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The review is at an early stage, said the person, who asked
            to remain anonymous because the inquiry isn't public. The Wall
            Street Journal, in a report on the review earlier today, said
            the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has conducted a
            similar probe into whether JPMorgan inappropriately steered
            private-banking clients into its own products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks can capture a greater portion of fees by having
            clients invest in their own products. In some cases, they can
            also offer better-than-average performance. New York-based
            JPMorgan said in February that 80 percent of its fixed-income
            assets under management and 81 percent of its equity assets were
            in funds that were in the top 40 percent of peers over the
            previous 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We manage a variety of portfolios based on a client's
            investment objectives, and the mix of solutions varies, is
            dynamic and transparent,' said Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan
            spokesman. 'Our clients have countless options in selecting
            financial providers. They come to JPMorgan because of our long-term investments track record and the depth
            and breadth of our
            platform.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the SEC, couldn't be
            immediately reached for comment. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC
            spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Unit Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private banking, which caters to wealthy individual
            clients, generated more than half of JPMorgan's $5.73 billion in
            asset-management revenue in the first six months of this year.
            The unit accounted for $383 billion in assets under management,
            or 22 percent of the division's $1.7 trillion total. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's asset-management business, led by Mary Callahan Erdoes, generated $993 million of net
            income in the first half
            of 2014, the lowest among the largest U.S. bank's four major
            divisions. The unit's 22 percent return on equity was the
            highest of the four. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan set aside $669 million for legal expenses in the
            second quarter. The lender agreed to pay $23 billion in
            penalties and settlements last year, leading to its first
            quarterly loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Two Ex-JPMorgan Traders Facing Arrest in London, NYT Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Authorities plan to arrest two
            former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) employees on fraud charges related
            to their role in a trading loss last year, the New York Times
            reported, citing people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, who worked in the
            bank's London office, will probably be taken into custody in
            coming days, the newspaper reported. They are natives of other
            European countries and British authorities may not be able to
            locate them, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An attorney for Martin-Artajo didn't immediately reply to
            requests for comment from Bloomberg News. An attorney for Grout
            and spokesmen for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S.
            Attorney's Office declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors determined that Martin-Artajo and Grout, who
            worked in a London unit that lost more than $6 billion last
            year, concealed losses from their managers in New York, the
            newspaper said. The case hinges on help from Bruno Iksil, who
            was dubbed the London Whale because of his trading positions'
            outsized effects on credit-derivative markets, according to the
            New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iksil, who some investigators decided had been unfairly
            blamed for the losses, met with authorities in Brussels and New
            York and secured a cooperation agreement with the U.S.
            government, the newspaper reported. It isn't clear whether he
            could face charges, according to the paper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Report &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An attorney for Iksil declined to comment to Bloomberg
            News, as did Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is also
            negotiating the final terms of a deal with the Securities and
            Exchange Commission to end a yearlong probe of the trading loss,
            two people briefed on the talks said on Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, is
            seeking to resolve U.S. and U.K. probes after botched trades by
            its chief investment office led to the losses and an earnings
            restatement. Senate investigators concluded in March that the
            bank dodged regulators and misled investors about the souring
            bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's own 129-page report on the losses, released in
            January, found that London traders initially tried to hide
            losses on the positions. The employees left the bank and the
            bank sought to claw back pay. The report also blamed managers,
            some of whom were reassigned or left the bank, for failing to
            halt the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who supervised Iksil, in January settled a
            London lawsuit brought against him by the bank, a person with
            direct knowledge said at the time. The bank sued Martin-Artajo
            in October without detailing its allegations in filings. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, is considering moving its headquarters within New
            York as the company has fewer employees in the nation's largest city, according to a person briefed on the
            discussions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The potential plans, which include taking office space in Manhattan
            developments at the World Trade Center or Hudson Yards, are in early stages and no decision is imminent,
            said the person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. JPMorgan has moved
            back-office jobs to New Jersey, Delaware and Florida to cut expenses, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks,
            under pressure to boost returns, have been seeking lower-cost locations for employees who don't interact
            directly with clients. JPMorgan is examining its property holdings in New York, where it had 11.4 million
            square feet (1.1 million square meters) at the end of 2013, including 1.3 million at its 270 Park Ave.

            to Shanghai-based Fosun International Ltd., and began moving 2,000 employees to offices in Brooklyn's

        <headline>JPMorgan to Sell 50% of Buyout Portfolio to Two Buyers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which last
            year said its private-equity unit would become independent,
            agreed to sell half of its $4.5 billion in buyout holdings to
            Carlyle Group LP (CG)'s AlpInvest Partners BV and Lexington Partners
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dealmakers at One Equity Partners LLC will form OEP Capital
            Advisors LP, an investment firm independent from New York-based
            JPMorgan, when the transaction is completed, which is expected
            by year-end, according to a statement today. OEP will manage the
            rest of the portfolio, JPMorgan said. Financial terms of the
            agreement weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms are unloading parts of their businesses
            as regulations require that they bolster capital and reduce
            investments made with their own money. JPMorgan, whose Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in December he's 'pruning'
            divisions the bank doesn't need, last month agreed to sell about
            $1.3 billion of loans and securities to Bain Capital LLC's
            Sankaty Advisors LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale of One Equity Partners' holdings isn't expected to
            have a material impact on JPMorgan's earnings, the company said
            in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lexington, based in New York, raised $7 billion in 2011 for
            a fund to buy stakes in buyout funds, a practice known as
            secondary private-equity investing. AlpInvest, a Dutch manager
            of funds-of-funds and secondary stakes with $52 billion in
            assets under management, is a unit of Washington-based Carlyle,
            the second-largest manager of investment alternatives to stocks
            and bonds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Appoints Bischoff as Chairman of Europe Arm</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) appointed Win Bischoff chairman of its main legal entity in Europe, the
            Middle
            East, and Africa as British regulators press banks to bolster
            oversight of their operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bischoff will replace Tom Hoppe in January 2015 if approved
            by the board, according to a memo from Daniel Pinto, 51, head of
            the global corporate and investment bank and chief executive
            officer of Europe, Middle East and Africa. The 73 year-old will
            first serve as a director as well as an independent adviser of
            the London branch's oversight committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision to appoint Bischoff comes at a time when
            British regulators are seeking to restore confidence in a
            industry that has been hit by a series of scandals ranging from
            rigging benchmark interest rates to foreign exchange. JPMorgan
            agreed to accords valued at $23 billion in 2013 to resolve
            probes into mortgage-bond sales, claims it failed to stop
            Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme and faulty oversight of a U.K.-
            based trader known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The non-executive directors of JPMorgan Securities are
            central to our firm's international governance, providing an
            independent perspective and input to the overall way we run our
            business,' Pinto said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused of Self-Dealing in Managing Church Trust</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was sued for
            fraud, self-dealing and mismanagement of trust accounts
            established for an Indianapolis church endowed by the
            descendants of drug company founder Eli Lilly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Christ Church Cathedral sued JPMorgan today in
            Indianapolis federal court, claiming it selected unsuitable and
            poorly-performing investments to further its own financial
            interests. The Episcopal church founded in 1837 accused the
            world's fourth-biggest bank by asset value of breaching state
            and federal securities laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank 'caused the church trusts to lose approximately
            $13 million in value as a result of JPMorgan's decisions to
            purchase over 177 different investment products, mostly from
            itself, using church funds,' between July 2004 and December
            2013, the plaintiffs said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The congregation seeks unspecified compensatory and
            punitive damages. The lawsuit comes five days after a Bloomberg
            News report that the Securities and Exchange Commission is
            reviewing whether conflicts of interest led JPMorgan to sell
            certain investment products to individual clients, according to
            a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Guided Architecture &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks can capture a greater portion of fees by having
            clients invest in their own products. The Christ Church
            Cathedral alleged JPMorgan employed a 'guided architecture'
            platform through which it selected products based on their
            profitability to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
            bank, declined to comment on the church lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan put between 68 percent and 85 percent of the
            church's assets into its own products, including private equity
            funds, structured notes and hedge funds, according to the
            complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Christ Church claims JPMorgan made more money on some of
            the financial products it bought for the church, even as the
            trusts bore all of the risk. During one seven-year stretch
            ending in 2013, according to the complaint, the trusts, which
            were worth as much as $39.2 million, declined to $31.6 million,
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time, JPMorgan's holdings increased by $1.4
            trillion and its net revenue more than doubled, the church
            claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Rector, Wardens and Vestrymen of the Christ
            Church Cathedral of Indianapolis v. JPMorgan Chase Co., 14-cv-01331, U.S. District Court, Southern District
            of Indiana

        <headline>CRH, Eren Said to Hire JPMorgan to Sell Turkey Cement Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;CRH Plc (CRH), Ireland's biggest cement
            company, and its Turkish partner Eren Holding AS have hired
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to help sell their cement joint venture in
            Turkey, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies including Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL), Limak
            Holding AS and Oyak Cement Group are interested in the unit, in
            which CRH holds a 50 percent stake with Istanbul-based Eren
            owning the rest, said the people, who asked not to be named
            because the talks are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The three potential bidders are among those shortlisted and
            the sale process for the unit, known as Denizli Cimento Sanayii
            TAS, could be finalized by October, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 20 domestic and international cement producers,
            including Italcementi SpA (IT), operate in Turkey, where cement
            makers have a total annual capacity of about 107 million tons,
            according to the local Cement Producers' Association. The
            country, which has a gross domestic product of about $820
            billion, is seeking to become one of the largest 10 economies in
            the world by 2023, and has planned $100 billion of
            infrastructure projects in the next four years, including a new
            bridge across the Bosphorus strait. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives of Sabanci Holding and Eren Holding didn't
            respond to e-mailed questions and calls seeking comment.
            Representatives of CRH, JPMorgan, Oyak, Denizli and Limak
            Holding declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Denizli Output &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denizli, in which CRH bought a 50 percent stake from Eren
            Holding in 2007, produces about 3 percent of Turkey's and 31
            percent of western Turkey's total clinker output, according to
            its website. The company is aiming to increase its sales to 250
            million liras ($116 million) this year from 220 million liras in
            2013, according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oyak Group's cement units include Mardin Cimento Sanayii
            Ticaret AS, Unye Cimento Sanayii Ticaret AS, Bolu Cimento
            Sanayii AS and Aslan Cimento AS, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sabanci's Cimsa Cimento agreed to buy Sancim Bilecik
            Cimento, a cement producer in western Turkey, from Sonmez Group
            for $220.7 million, it said in a public filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;

            mismanagement of its trust accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Banks Said to Get Enforcement Letters in FX-Rigging Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan Chase Co., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
            Morgan Stanley (MS) have been notified that regulators are preparing
            enforcement actions on currency rigging, people familiar with
            the investigation said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Talks are progressing between banks, the U.S. Federal
            Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to
            settle investigations into alleged manipulation of foreign-exchange markets, according to two people who
            asked not to be
            identified because the discussions are private. Some firms have
            received so-called 15-day letters outlining the agencies'
            findings and warning that enforcement actions are likely, the
            people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enforcement actions can range from cease-and-desist orders
            to fines to banning bankers from the industry. The letters
            typically detail the investigators' findings and give recipients
            about 15 days to offer a written defense. Such notices usually
            open a final stage of settlement negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are coordinating with the U.K.'s Financial
            Conduct Authority to settle some of the probes by November,
            according to two people. The FCA is in settlement talks with
            firms including Barclays Plc, Citigroup, HSBC Holdings Plc,
            JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and UBS AG. It
            scheduled meetings with some banks for as soon as next month to
            discuss penalties, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A few investigations are taking longer, and talks with
            firms such as Bank of America Corp. and HSBC haven't progressed
            as far, according to some of the people. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Corinthian Subpoenaed for Records on Student Outcomes, Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corinthian Colleges Inc. (COCO), the for-profit chain in the
            process of selling or shutting its campuses, received a federal
            grand jury subpoena seeking records on student-loan defaults and
            job placement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aug. 8 subpoena also seeks information on graduation
            rates, the transferability of student credits and marketing
            materials, according to a regulatory filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corinthian, which served about 72,000 students as of last
            month when it agreed to a government plan to shut down or sell
            its 107 campuses, is facing allegations in multiple states of
            falsifying job placement and marketing data. The Santa Ana,
            California-based company is evaluating the subpoena and intends
            to cooperate fully with the request, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corinthian's downfall accelerated in June when the U.S.
            Education Department imposed a 21-day waiting period for it to
            draw on the federal student aid that accounts for almost all its
            revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There can be no assurance that the company will be able
            to obtain any such additional needed liquidity on a timely
            basis, on terms acceptable to it, or at all,' Corinthian said
            in yesterday's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Barclays Seen Facing $2 Billion More in 2014 Conduct Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) faces costs of as much as 1.2 billion pounds
            ($2 billion) for its alleged rigging of currency markets, lying
            to clients about its U.S. dark pool and mis-selling interest-rate swaps, Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. said.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K.'s second-largest lender may incur a 700 million-pound charge to settle a foreign-exchange
            probe with regulators
            and a further 200 million pounds relating to a U.S.
            investigation into its private-trading venue, Chirantan Barua,
            an analyst at Bernstein in London, said in a note yesterday. The
            bank might reach settlements by the end of 2014, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays is part of a group of banks in talks with the
            U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority to reach a settlement in the
            currency-rigging probe, while fighting a U.S. lawsuit accusing
            it of falsifying marketing materials to hide the presence of
            high-frequency traders in its dark pool. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The scandals are undermining Chief Executive Officer Antony
            Jenkins's attempts to reform the culture of a bank after it was
            fined 290 million pounds in 2012 for rigging the Libor benchmark
            interest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;London-based Barclays may also set aside 300 million pounds
            in the second half to compensate customers improperly sold
            interest-rate hedging products, Barua estimates. The bank didn't
            make further provisions for redress in the first half. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other British lenders are also struggling with rising
            provisions for misconduct. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
            Britain's largest state-owned lender, may face as much as 1
            billion pounds in charges to settle the allegations of currency
            market manipulation, Barua wrote in an separate Aug. 11 report. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is withholding documents that might show the
            government sued Standard Poor's for fraud in retaliation for
            downgrading the country's debt, the ratings company said in a
            court filing this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In April, a federal judge ruled that SP could seek
            potential evidence from the Justice Department. Since then, the
            government has turned over documents with redactions ranging
            from the omission of a single word on a page to multiple pages,
            SP said in court documents filed Aug. 12 seeking to compel
            production. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. McGraw-Hill Cos., 13-cv-00779, U.S.
            District Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Paul Singer Gets OK to Follow Argentina Money Trail to Nevada &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Paul Singer, the hedge fund founder seeking to
            collect on more than $1.5 billion in judgments over Argentina's
            defaulted bonds, may search Nevada for some of that money, a
            judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Singer asked a Las Vegas court in April to order 123
            companies in Nevada to turn over information about assets
            belonging to Argentine businessman Lazaro Baez, who is accused
            in that country of embezzling $65 million from government
            contracts. U.S. Magistrate Judge Cam Ferenbach in Reno granted
            that request Aug. 11, ruling that Singer's hedge fund was
            attempting to execute a valid judgment against Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is no doubt that the 123 companies are shell
            corporations,' Ferenbach said in an order. 'Similarly, there
            is no doubt that shell corporations are routinely formed to
            commit fraud.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Singer's decade-long quest to recoup on investments in
            Argentina's debt peaked last month when the country went into
            default for the second time in 13 years after talks broke down
            with some creditors. Singer leads a group of hedge funds owed
            more than $1.5 billion from the country's 2001 default. A
            federal judge in New York barred Argentina from paying on
            restructured debt until it satisfies Singer's group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his order, Ferenbach wrote that Argentina's failure so
            far to satisfy judgments won by Singer's NML Capital has caused
            the company to 'travel the globe in search of property owned by
            Argentina.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Argentina, 14-00492, U.S.
            District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Amazon's Prices Seen Holding Regulators at Bay in Hachette Spat &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)'s treatment of customers means more to U.S.
            antitrust authorities than how the largest Web retailer
            pressures publishers and movie studios. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Typically it's seen as a good thing for a retailer to
            pressure suppliers to trim prices, as that can lead to better
            deals for shoppers, David Balto, a former policy director at the
            Federal Trade Commission, said in an interview with Bloomberg
            News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The antitrust cops clearly would be on Amazon's
            doorstep' if it was also pushing those suppliers to charge
            competing retailers more, he said. Successfully going after
            Amazon at this stage 'would be breaking new territory under the
            antitrust laws.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That hasn't damped debate about the tactics Chief Executive
            Officer Jeff Bezos is using against Hachette Book Group, Walt
            Disney Co. and film studio Warner Bros. The question is whether
            he's pushing Amazon toward the same monopolistic territory that
            tripped up Microsoft Corp., Standard Oil and ATT Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They are getting very close to the line,' said Joseph
            Tabacco, a former senior trial lawyer at the Justice Department
            who has worked on federal monopoly and price-fixing cases
            against mining, electronics and pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A phone call left at Seattle-based Amazon's press office
            wasn't immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amazon, the world's largest Web retailer, commands 60
            percent of the U.S. e-book sales, a market that is projected to
            jump almost sevenfold to $8.6 billion as demand for paper books
            falls, according to Forrester Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Won Rising to Pre-Lehman Levels on Surplus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea's record current-account
            surplus will boost the won to levels prior to the 2008 global
            credit crisis, JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Seoul branch manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won will climb past 1,000 per dollar as local equities
            attract inflows, Managing Director Lee Sung Hee said in an Aug.
            14 interview, without specifying a timeframe. The U.S. bank's
            Singapore-based strategist Daniel Hui predicts a 1.8 percent
            gain to 1,000 by end-December. The median estimate in a
            Bloomberg survey of 31 analysts is for a 0.7 percent decline to
            1,025 in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currency has advanced 3.1 percent this year as global
            funds pumped $27.7 billion into South Korean bonds and stocks.
            The central bank last month raised its 2014 forecast for the
            current-account excess to an unprecedented $84 billion from $68
            billion. The Bank of Korea's decision last week to lower
            borrowing costs in support of the government's efforts to revive
            economic growth won't deter capital inflows, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would be difficult for the won to weaken given a
            current-account surplus of this size,' Lee, who is also
            JPMorgan's head of global emerging markets in Korea, said in his
            office in Seoul. 'Gains in the stock market will spur inflows,
            adding appreciation pressure on the won.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won rose 0.3 percent from Aug. 14 to 1,017.75 per
            dollar as of 12:19 p.m. in Seoul, according to prices from local
            banks. Korean financial markets were closed for a public holiday
            on Aug. 15. The currency rallied 0.8 percent on Aug. 14, the
            most since April, as the central bank cut its key interest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Currency Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation's currency last traded at 1,000 per dollar in
            July 2008, before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
            bankruptcy, triggering a crisis in global credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hui, the JPMorgan strategist, predicts that after reaching
            1,000 by September, the won will remain at that level through
            the end of 2014 before climbing to 995 by March and to 985 in
            June. The median forecasts in the Bloomberg survey are for the
            currency to reach 1,020 in the first quarter of 2015 and 1,017
            in the second. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea's finance ministry unveiled a 11.7 trillion won
            ($11.5 billion) spending program on July 24 after cutting its
            2014 growth forecast to 3.7 percent from 3.9 percent. The
            ministry plans to encourage companies to boost dividend payouts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the government's policy goals is to raise the
            wealth effect by boosting prices of asset such as equities,'
            JPMorgan's Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The benchmark Kospi (KOSPI) index of shares gained 2.7 percent this
            quarter, more than the 1.5 percent increase in the MSCI Asia
            Pacific Index of regional equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stimulus Measures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank reduced its key interest rate from 2.5
            percent to 2.25 percent on Aug. 14, the first cut since May
            2013. The move will help boost the effectiveness of the
            government's stimulus, Governor Lee Ju Yeol said the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fiscal spending package, along with the central bank's
            policy easing, will encourage foreign inflows by supporting
            growth and boosting equities, Morgan Stanley strategists
            including Geoffrey Kendrick in Hong Kong wrote in an Aug. 14
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower borrowing costs won't discourage overseas bond
            investors as central banks and sovereign wealth funds tend to
            focus on long-term economic fundamentals, according to the
            report. Global central banks accounted for 42 percent of foreign
            investment in South Korean bonds as of end-2013, data from the
            finance ministry show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Volatility Seen &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the won will appreciate over the long term, the
            currency may face increased volatility due to geopolitical
            tension in Ukraine and slower economic growth in Europe,
            according to JPMorgan's Lee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One-month implied volatility in the won, a gauge of
            expected swings in the exchange rate used to price options, has
            risen 125 basis points, or 1.25 percentage points, this quarter
            to 5.90 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A certain amount of foreign-exchange volatility can be
            beneficial to traders and companies,' Lee said. 'Too little
            volatility tends to lead to overreactions by investors if the
            exchange rate moves beyond a certain range.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Manulife Adds JPMorgan's Warnes for Asia Money Management</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC), Canada's
            largest life insurer, hired Peter Warnes from JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) to expand its asset-management unit in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warnes, who started yesterday, is head of the international
            portfolio solutions group and is based in Hong Kong, the
            Toronto-based insurer said in a statement. He previously worked
            in Asia and London for JPMorgan asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manulife is among North American insurers seeking to add
            fee income by managing funds for outside investors. In May, the
            firm hired Kai Sotorp from UBS AG as chief executive officer of
            the asset-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Demand for asset allocation investment solutions is
            growing remarkably across Asia,' Michael Dommermuth, Manulife's
            president of international asset management, said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manulife oversaw about $597 billion of funds as of June 30.
            Warnes will help clients figure out how much of their funds to
            invest in different types of assets. The business he's joining
            oversees more than $5.9 billion for retail clients, sovereign
            wealth and pension funds, Manulife said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Have Led Record Buying of India Bonds Yesterday</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. bought about
            $2.4 billion of Indian government bonds yesterday, leading
            record purchases by international banks, according to three
            fixed-income dealers in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign lenders acquired a net 148 billion rupees ($2.4
            billion) of sovereign debt yesterday, the most in Clearing Corp.
            of India Ltd. data going back to 2006. JPMorgan may have
            purchased the notes on behalf of institutional clients, the
            dealers said, asking not to be identified as the information
            isn't public. Mollica Senapati, a spokeswoman in Mumbai for the
            U.S. bank, declined to comment on the matter in an e-mailed
            response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global funds pumped in an unprecedented $13.8 billion into
            local government and corporate bonds in 2014 as India's success
            in reining in inflation and stabilizing the rupee added to
            optimism the nation's new government will spur economic growth.
            JPMorgan's purchases made up about 90 percent of the $2.76
            billion pumped in by overseas money managers yesterday, exchange
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The purchases represent a significant amount for the bond
            markets,' said Anindya Das Gupta, Mumbai-based treasurer at
            Barclays Plc. 'A stable currency, easing inflation and the
            fiscal intent of the government are helping to boost the global
            appetite for Indian bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 8.4 percent sovereign securities
            due July 2024 dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
            point, yesterday to 8.48 percent, the lowest level this month.
            That's the biggest decline in a week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rupee, Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee has rebounded 13 percent from a record low of
            68.845 per dollar reached a year ago, the world's best-performing currency in the period, according to data
            compiled by
            Bloomberg. Consumer-price inflation in India slowed to 7.96
            percent in July from as much as 11.2 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Arun Jaitley aims to reduce the budget
            deficit to 4.1 percent of gross domestic product, which would be
            the least since 2008, in the year through March 2015, according
            to official estimates released last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's bond purchases were executed across different
            maturities in the afternoon trading session, the dealers said.
            All other categories of investors, including public and private
            banks, mutual funds and primary dealers, were net sellers of the
            securities yesterday, the Clearing Corp. data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nigeria's 10-year bonds will be
            added to the JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) benchmark emerging-market
            index series, the nation's debt management agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The debt due 2024 will become part of the gauge by Aug. 29,
            Patience Oniha, executive director in charge of market
            development at the Debt Management Office, said by phone from
            the capital, Abuja. The inclusion reaffirms the strength of the
            Nigerian bond market, she said &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan added the West African nation's bonds due 2014,
            2019 and 2022 to its emerging-market index series in 2012,
            predicting the inclusion may lure $1.5 billion of portfolio
            investments to Africa's biggest oil producer. Barclays added
            some of the country's debts to its index last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan will want to add more Nigerian bonds in the
            future as old ones on their portfolio drop in tenor and there is
            need to review and add longer-tenor bonds that will reflect true
            pricing,' Kunle Ezun, a fixed-income securities and currency
            analyst at Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) in Lagos, said by phone.
            'The addition will give the Nigerian bond market a global
            outlook, increase investor demand and drop yields.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Nigerian bonds due March 2024 fell 1.8 percent
            to 12 percent yesterday, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Russian hackers attacked the U.S. financial system in mid-August, infiltrating and stealing data
            from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and at least one other bank, an incident the FBI is investigating as a

            &lt;p&gt;In one case, the hackers used a software flaw known as a zero-day vulnerability in one of the
            banks' websites. They then plowed through layers of elaborate security to steal the data, a feat security
            experts said appeared far beyond the capability of ordinary criminal hackers. The incidents occurred at a
            low point in relations between Russia and the West. Russian troops continue to mass on the Ukrainian border
            and the West tightens sanctions aimed at crippling Russian companies, including some of the country's most
            important banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Government Link &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sophistication of the attack
            and technical indicators extracted from the banks' computers provide some evidence of a government link.
            Still, the trail is muddy enough that investigators are considering the possibility that it's cyber
            criminals from Russia or elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Other federal agencies, including the National
            Security Agency, are now aiding the investigation, a third person familiar with the probe said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Computer hackers targeted JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and at least four other banks in a coordinated
            attack on major financial institutions this month, according to a U.S. official. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            attack led to the theft of customer data that could be used to drain accounts, according to another person
            briefed by U.S. law enforcement. The two people, who asked not to be identified because the investigation is
            continuing, discussed the incident after Bloomberg News reported a breach on banks earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hackers targeted customer and employee information, said a third person involved in the
            investigation, who was also briefed by the government. The theft involved gigabytes of data, said several
            people familiar with the attacks. The scale indicates a potential for significant financial fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most thefts of financial information involve retailers or personal computers of consumers. Stealing
            data from big banks is rare, because they have elaborate firewalls and security systems. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:

            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg report said the FBI is investigating whether Russian hackers attacked JPMorgan and at
            least one other bank in retaliation for sanctions on the country over its involvement in the Ukraine
            military conflict. New York-based JPMorgan declined to comment on whether it was a victim of hacking, while
            saying the bank has multiple layers of defense to fend off data thefts. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's $380 Billion Man Won't Let Bubble Get Him Down</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;All those bond investors fretting
            about a bubble will probably be right eventually. In the
            meantime, they may want to think about buying some junk debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's how Bob Michele, who oversees $380 billion as
            JPMorgan Asset Management's chief investment officer for fixed
            income, is approaching the market. Just because yields on
            speculative-grade debt are falling toward the lowest ever,
            that's not a good enough reason to avoid it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ultimately there will be a bubble,' Michele said in a
            Bloomberg Television interview on Aug. 26. As for now, he said,
            'there's only so long that you're going to sit in cash earning
            a zero percent return in the U.S., perhaps a negative yield in
            Europe, before you go back into some form of bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michele isn't alone in seeing value in junk bonds despite
            Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's suggestion that the market
            has gotten frothy. While high-yield notes in the U.S. posted a
            1.3 percent loss last month, their first in almost a year,
            they've bounced right back with a 1.5 percent gain in August,
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reason yields are so low is because of the Fed's easy
            money policies, which are ongoing (even if a little scaled
            back). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So why leave now when the party's still good? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Not Much Upside &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's understandable why investors would be wary of plunging
            into less-creditworthy debt right now. Junk-rated bonds are
            yielding 5.9 percent as measured by Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch index data. That's about 0.2 percentage point from the
            all-time low, meaning potential returns are significantly less
            than the historic average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While mutual-fund investors yanked a record $7.1 billion
            from the debt in the week ended Aug. 6, they've since had a
            change of heart, plowing $2.9 billion back into the funds in the
            two weeks since, according to data provider Lipper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody has been lulled into this comforting notion
            that between a Goldilocks economy, not lifting off but not
            collapsing, and the Fed being the market's best friend, it's OK
            to leverage every risk factor,' Mohamed El-Erian, former chief
            executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. and
            Bloomberg View columnist, said in an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody's in the same trade,' he said. 'If sentiment
            changes, there's no shock absorber in the system.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Call it a game of chicken, where investors wait as long as
            they can before slipping out just before everybody else runs for
            the exits. Or perhaps another case of don't fight the Fed, which
            has pledged to keep benchmark rates low for a prolonged period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Typically you see bubbles at the end of Fed tightening,
            when the Fed has withdrawn liquidity from the system,' Michele
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's not happening yet. So for now, game on. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Bank Fined, FDIC Vote, JPMorgan Anti-Hack: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's biggest
            investment bank, was fined 4.7 million pounds ($7.8 million) by
            the British markets regulator for failing to properly report
            millions of transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A coding error reversed a buy/sell indicator, leading
            Deutsche Bank to improperly report on $29.4 million in
            transactions involving a type of swap in which the seller agrees
            to pay the buyer the difference between the current value of a
            stock, and its value when the contract is made. If the
            difference is negative, the buyer pays the seller. The swaps
            were made between November 2007 and April 2013, the Financial
            Conduct Authority said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA has been cracking down to ensure firms provide
            accurate and full reporting on transactions. The London-based
            regulator has fined 10 other firms for similar failures,
            according to its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said it 'immediately undertook a complete
            review of our transaction reporting systems to rectify the
            problem and strengthen our control framework' after the issue
            was identified in March 2013, according to an e-mail yesterday
            from Kathryn Hanes, a London-based Deutsche Bank spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt-based bank is spending 1 billion euros ($1.3
            billion) to improve its controls and reporting systems and is
            dedicating 1,300 people to that effort, including the hiring of
            about 500 people in the U.S. this year, Chief Financial Officer
            Stefan Krause said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FDIC to Hold Sept. 3 Board Meeting For Vote on Margin Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance
            Corp. will consider proposed rules at an open session Sept. 3,
            according to a public notice published on the agency's website,
            as required under a federal law known as the Government in the
            Sunshine Act. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;No discussion of the rules is planned for the session,
            according to the notice. The matters 'will be resolved with a
            single vote, unless a member of the board of directors requests
            that an item be removed from the agenda,' according to the
            notice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rules to be voted on concern margin and capital
            requirements for covered swap entities; a liquidity coverage
            ratio final rule; and regulatory capital rules, according to
            notice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately U.S. banks had $40.2 billion in net income in
            the second quarter as lenders cut costs to offset a decline in
            trading income, the FDIC said in its quarterly snapshot of the
            industry's performance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After a record-setting average of $38.6 billion in
            industry-wide profit per quarter last year, banks have had mixed
            results this year, the FDIC said in the Quarterly Banking
            Profile released in Washington yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;York London Office Said to Be Probed by Spain Over Bankia Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The London office of James Dinan's York Capital Management
            LP may face civil charges from Spanish regulators for allegedly
            using a banned trading technique before last year's bailout of
            mortgage giant Bankia SA. (BKIA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores, or CNMV,
            notified Dinan's firm in March it was scrutinizing a May 2013
            short sale by the York European Focus Fund, according to a
            regulatory filing. The stock involved was Bankia, according to a
            person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified
            because the details are private. In December, the Spanish
            regulator started a probe into bets made against Bankia shares
            before May 23, 2013, when the stock plunged 51 percent after
            terms of a government bailout were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The civil charges against York would be one of the first
            cases filed under a new regulatory code adopted by the European
            Union in 2012 to restrict short selling, blamed by many local
            officials for exacerbating the global financial crisis. Richard
            Swanson, York's general counsel, declined to comment. In a
            regulatory filing, York said the trade was reviewed by its
            compliance department and other parties, and that there were
            circumstances outside its control that prevented a timely
            delivery of shares to execute the trade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CNMV as a policy does not comment on its supervision
            process, according to a spokeswoman for the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Boosts Customer Data Protections After Cyber-Attack &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, said it
            increased defenses against computer hackers after an attack
            against the industry this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender is working with U.S. authorities to determine
            the scope of the assault and is taking additional steps to
            safeguard confidential information, Patricia Wexler, a
            spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said yesterday in an e-mail, declining to give specific examples.
            JPMorgan will contact
            any customers that might have been affected, Wexler said, adding
            that the firm hasn't seen unusual fraud levels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was among at least five banks targeted in the
            coordinated attack on financial institutions in recent weeks, a
            U.S. official said Aug. 27. The assault led to the theft of
            customer data that could be used to drain accounts, according to
            another person briefed by U.S. law enforcement. Both asked not
            to be identified because U.S. probes are continuing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, has warned
            shareholders in annual letters that hackers' efforts to breach
            the bank's computers were growing more frequent, sophisticated

            &lt;p&gt;Russia's equity markets may face a 'Lehman moment' if the Ukraine conflict deteriorates further,
            according to Alexander Kantarovich, head of research for JPMorgan Chase Co. in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'With
            the significant deterioration in the Ukrainian situation, markets may treat this as a Lehman-style shock,'
            Kantarovich wrote in an e-mailed report today. 'Revisiting the post-Lehman lows would imply downside of 50
            percent from an index perspective.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's ruble-denominated Micex Index has fallen
            6.6 percent this year. The stock gauge posted the worst monthly drop in July since 2012 as the U.S. and the
            European Union escalated sanctions targeting Russia's $2 trillion economy after the downing of a passenger
            jet on July 17 over Ukrainian territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The Micex lost 67 percent in 2008, the biggest decline among benchmarks in the 30 largest stock
            markets, as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s collapse triggered a global recession and foreign banks cut
            credit. It rebounded by 120 percent in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kantarovich
            sees significant differences between the situation now and the 2008-2009 crisis because oil prices, Russia's
            chief export, are holding up and an economic contraction 'may not be that deep.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;While global fines for rate-rigging have already topped $3.7 billion, the cost to banks may climb
            as they face lawsuits worldwide. An EU accord includes a finding of liability that can be used in civil
            cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan joined HSBC Holdings Plc and Credit Agricole SA in pulling out of the
            Euribor settlement talks, according to the person. ICAP Plc won't take part in the Libor settlement process,
            which relates to the yen, the Financial Times reported yesterday, without saying where it got the
            information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rejecting a settlement and facing a higher fine could be worth the risk,
            said Noelle Lenoir, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis Frankel LLP in Paris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies
            'know full well that admitting to what they are charged with would be a money pit,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

            While JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, decided to pull out of the Euribor deal, the U.S. bank is
            part of the yen-Libor settlement, according to a person familiar with the probe. The set of evidence is
            different in both cases, said the person. Close

        <headline>Treasury Yields Only Attractive at 3.5%, JPMorgan's Stealey Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S., German and U.K. government bond
            yields are too low to be attractive given the outlook for
            improving global growth, according to JPMorgan Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasury 10-year notes should yield 3.50 percent based on
            growth and inflation forecasts and the impact of the Federal
            Reserve's asset-purchase program, instead of today's 2.78
            percent, JPMorgan executives said in a presentation in London.
            Benchmark German bund yields should be at 2.20 percent, versus
            1.72 percent, while similar-maturity U.K. gilts should yield
            3.30 percent instead of 2.82 percent, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We still can't get too excited about government bonds,'
            said Iain Stealey, a portfolio manager for JPMorgan's
            international fixed-income group. 'If gilt yields or Treasury
            yields wax and wane you can still lose a little bit of money
            owning government bonds. We don't see there to be much
            opportunity there.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The benchmark Treasury yield climbed to this year's high of
            3.01 percent on Sept. 6, from as low as 1.61 percent in May, as
            signs the world's largest economy is gaining momentum fueled
            bets the Fed is moving toward reducing its $85 billion a month
            in asset purchases. The yield was last at 3.50 percent in
            April 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasuries have lost investors 2.5 percent this year after
            returning 2 percent in 2012 and 10 percent in 2011, according to
            Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Gilts dropped 3.6 percent and
            German securities fell 1.2 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Low' Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People want fixed income that can potentially give them
            some sort of return and government bonds used to do that,' said
            Nick Gartside, international chief investment officer for fixed-income at the New York-based investment
            bank, which manages $1.5
            trillion. 'What we're seeing from institutional investors is
            they want a source of fixed income that can potentially give
            them a return, which clearly with low government bond yields and
            low corporate bond yields is a stretch.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bases its estimate for where the Treasury 10-year
            yield should be on a 2014 growth forecast of 2.6 percent and
            inflation prediction of 1.9 percent, and a reduction of 1
            percentage point due to the impact of the Fed's debt-purchase
            program known as quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Largest Note Since 2010 Tied to Own Futures Index</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $234.7
            million of structured notes tied to a proprietary gauge of seven
            futures indexes, its largest U.S. offering in at least four
            years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five-year securities, issued Nov. 22, yield the gains
            and losses of the JPMorgan Enhanced Beta Select Backwardation
            Alternative Benchmark Total Return Index, according to a
            prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission. The gauge consists of seven other indexes tied to
            prices of commodities futures from gold to lean hogs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index rebalances monthly, based on weightings of its
            members in the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index, the most popular
            commodity benchmark for structured notes this year, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Its level rises and falls with
            market prices and its members can change weekly to favor
            commodities showing the most 'backwardation,' where earlier
            contracts cost more than later deliveries, according to the
            prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A backwardated market is by no means indicative of prices
            falling into the future,' said Stephen Schork, president of the
            Schork Group Inc., a consultant to the energy industry in
            Villanova, Pennsylvania. 'The fact that prices are lower in the
            future isn't an indication that demand is going to fall in the
            future. It's just an indication that demand in the spot market
            is very strong.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index was established Sept. 30, less than two months
            before the securities were sold, according to the prospectus.
            Since then, it fell 0.4 percent to 101.93 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investor Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank charges 0.85 percent a year in investor fees, so
            the index would have to rise from its starting level at least
            4.25 percent at maturity for the notes to break even. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Backwardation can provide investors with a so-called roll
            yield from buying the earlier monthly contract and then
            collecting the difference as they sell and transfer into the
            next, cheaper month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank in New York,
            declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts with
            values derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asks Judge to Keep Draft U.S. Fraud Suit Secret</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) had a hearing
            behind closed doors with a Pennsylvania judge in its bid to keep
            secret a draft of a government lawsuit related to its $13
            billion settlement with the U.S. as well as the identity of an
            employee who cooperated in a federal probe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is fighting an Oct. 17 order by Judge Stanton
            Wettick in Pittsburgh that it release the document and the
            employee's name to lawyers for the Federal Home Loan Bank of
            Pittsburgh, who say the material may provide a more detailed
            account of the U.S. Justice Department probe of JPMorgan that
            could be used in their lawsuit against the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'FHLB has not set forth any facts supporting why it needs
            the draft DOJ complaint or what admissible evidence it might
            glean from the allegations of a complaint,' Deborah Little, a
            lawyer for JPMorgan, said in a court filing. 'FHLB has not
            demonstrated any nexus between the DOJ's investigation and the
            subject matter of this case.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to the start of a hearing today, Wettick closed the
            courtroom to the public. Lawyers on both sides declined to
            comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FHLB lost $2.3 billion on mortgage-backed securities it
            purchased from JPMorgan. The losses aren't covered by the record
            U.S. settlement resolving allegations that the bank misled
            buyers about the soundness and risks of the investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, is paying the
            record settlement to resolve Justice Department probes into the
            bank's sale of mortgage bonds that officials said helped feed
            the financial chaos of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FHLB's Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The conduct and deals at issue in the settlement are the
            same ones at the heart of the FHLB's case, David Beehler, an
            attorney for the Pittsburgh bank, said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acknowledged the settlement's statement of facts
            without admitting violations of law, Chief Financial Officer
            Marianne Lake said on a Nov. 19 conference call. In the
            statement, the official narrative of events leading to the
            infractions, the bank acknowledged that from 2005 to 2007 its
            subsidiaries securitized subprime and Alt-A mortgages loans and
            sold the resulting mortgaged-backed securities to investors
            while failing to disclose that the loans didn't meet
            underwriting standards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The statement doesn't refer to specific employees,
            documents or events. It also doesn't provide any details about
            the loan programs or vendors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pittsburgh bank is suing JPMorgan and credit rating
            companies including Moody's Investors Service over mortgage-backed securities it bought in 2006 and 2007.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Draft Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FHLB attorneys persuaded Wettick in October to order
            JPMorgan to turn over the draft civil fraud complaint prepared
            by U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento, California. The
            lawsuit alleged violations of the Financial Institution Reform,
            Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, known as FIRREA, according
            to court filings in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The law allows the government to sue an individual or
            group, rather than charge them with a crime, for fraud that
            affects a federally insured financial institution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FHLB agreed to give the bank until Nov. 22 to provide the
            document at the request of Justice Department lawyers who said
            the agency was close to a settlement, according to court
            filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord was announced Nov. 19, and three days later
            JPMorgan attorneys notified the FHLB that it would seek to block
            Wettick's order, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fraudulent Conduct' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given JPMorgan's apparent deep desire to prevent it from
            ever seeing the light of day, it would not be at all surprising
            if the draft complaint is a much more detailed account of
            JPMorgan's fraudulent conduct, and as such, far more
            enlightening than the statement of facts,' according to the
            filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the draft complaint was provided to it by the
            Justice Department as a 'confidential settlement
            communication' and it agreed to use it solely for the purpose
            of settlement negotiations, according to a court filing.
            Allowing the document to be turned over to the FHLB would
            violate state and federal law and 'chill the use of such
            materials in future settlement negotiations,' JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Moody's Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its case against Moody's, the Pittsburgh bank is seeking
            to question Jerome Fons, a former executive of the ratings
            company who criticized credit graders to U.S. lawmakers in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the FHLB have asked Wettick to allow them to
            question Fons on his testimony in a case against Morgan Stanley (MS)
            and other banks in federal court in Manhattan. That testimony,
            under seal after the case was voluntarily dismissed, was given
            to plaintiff lawyers in Pittsburgh. Moody's argued in court
            papers filed Nov. 20 that a deposition of Fons would 'provide
            no evidence relevant to this action and will only place undue
            burden on Moody's.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fons 'has no firsthand knowledge of any Moody's structured
            finance analyst ever allowing market share pressure to impact a
            particular rating,' lawyers for Moody's said, citing sections
            of the sealed testimony transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;House Committee &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fons told the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform
            Committee in October 2008 that originators of structured
            securities typically chose the agency with the lowest standards,
            'engendering a race to the bottom in terms of rating quality.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs allege Moody's and other rating companies
            assigned the highest possible ratings to mortgage-loan pools so
            they could be sold to institutional investors all the while
            knowing the certificates were actually junk bonds, according to
            court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fons, formerly a Moody's managing director for credit, left
            the firm in August 2007. Until his departure, he helped set
            criteria for how the firm rated the debt of corporations,
            financial institutions and countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The truth is that the rating agencies did not have
            sufficient and reliable information to place a triple-A rating
            on the securities,' the Pittsburgh bank said in court papers.
            'The rating agencies and other defendants knew they were
            feeding false information into their predictive models and that
            those models could not predict the losses on the loans in the
            mortgage pools.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh v. J.P.
            Morgan Securities LLC, GD09-016892, Court of Common Pleas of
            Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fidelity National Hires JPMorgan to Weigh Sale of Assets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity National Financial Inc. (FNF),
            the title insurer that also has restaurant businesses and an
            auto-parts company, hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to review
            possible divestitures of assets as the firm narrows its focus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer will consider spinoffs and sales of portfolio
            company investments, Jacksonville, Florida-based Fidelity
            National said today in a statement. The company holds stakes in
            vehicle-component maker Remy International Inc. (REMY), human-resources
            firm Ceridian Corp. and American Blue Ribbon Holdings LLC, the
            operator of restaurants including O'Charley's, Max Erma's,
            Village Inn and Bakers Square. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chairman William Foley is increasing his focus on the
            housing market after agreeing in May to buy Lender Processing
            Services Inc. (LPS), a former unit, for about $2.9 billion. The deal,
            which hasn't yet been completed, will help Foley expand in the
            business of providing and analyzing mortgage data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our energies are focused on the pending acquisition,'
            Foley said in the statement. 'Portfolio company investments
            have significant value which may not be fully reflected in our
            stock price'and we believe there are attractive alternatives we
            can pursue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity National, the largest U.S. title insurer, advanced
            2.7 percent to $30.34 at the close in New York. The company
            gained 25 percent this year through yesterday, trailing the 28
            percent rally in the Standard Poor's Midcap 400 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Shoppers are loading up on Internet
            coupons heading into the holidays -- and investors will soon get
            their chance to do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebates Shopping.com Inc., which offers online coupons and
            discounts to consumers, picked JPMorgan Chase Co. to lead its
            initial public offering next year with help from Bank of America
            Corp., according to people with knowledge of the deal, who asked
            not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Online shopping jumped about 20 percent to a record on
            Cyber Monday last week, as consumers surfed the Web for post-Thanksgiving deals in lieu of hitting physical
            stores. More than
            100 million adults in the U.S. will use digital coupons next
            year, up from 96.6 million in 2013, according to researcher
            EMarketer Inc. That spurred online couponer RetailMeNot Inc. to
            go public earlier this year and is generating growth at Ebates
            and rival Coupons.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advertising and consumer-related companies are lining up to
            go public after Twitter Inc. (TWTR)'s offering last month and the rally
            that followed. TubeMogul Inc., a maker of software for digital
            marketing, and The Rubicon Project Inc., an online ad company,
            have picked banks for IPOs, as has Internet-dating site Zoosk
            Inc., people familiar with the companies have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebates was founded in 1998. The San Francisco-based company
            offers discounts to more than 1,600 online stores, including
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Macy's Inc. and Home Depot Inc. Members get
            paid back a percentage of every purchase they make each quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives from Ebates, JPMorgan and Bank of America
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebates is backed by investors including August Capital,
            Canaan Partners and Foundation Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RetailMeNot, based in Austin, Texas, has climbed 28 percent
            since its IPO in July and is valued at about $1.36 billion. The
            company and its shareholders filed earlier this week to sell an
            additional 6.27 million shares. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon said banks will have to charge more for
            lending to get a 'fair return' as regulators require the
            industry to set aside more funds to cushion against losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think that you're going to have all these banks
            around the world holding this amount of capital and the
            revolvers will cost the same,' Dimon, 57, said today at an
            investor conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New
            York. Revolving loans and repurchase agreements are among
            products that 'use a lot of balance sheet' and will have to be
            repriced, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are forcing firms to hold more capital
            against assets banks consider low risk by proposing a minimum
            leverage ratio of 5 percent as an increased buffer against
            potential losses. Market participants have said that would
            affect pricing and access to lending in the repurchase
            agreement, or repo, market, in which borrowers sell lenders
            securities with an agreement to buy them back later. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms face new curbs, including limits on
            hedging, designed to prevent financial blowups after the Federal
            Reserve and four other regulators yesterday adopted the Volcker
            rule, a centerpiece of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The hedging
            provision drew more attention in the Volcker rule debate after
            JPMorgan lost $6.2 billion last year in bets on credit
            derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) may pay about
            $2 billion to resolve U.S. probes into whether the bank ignored
            signs of Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the New York Times
            reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm is close to a deal that includes a deferred
            prosecution agreement and more than $1 billion in penalties to
            resolve a criminal case, with remaining sanctions imposed by
            federal regulators investigating gaps in the company's money-laundering safeguards, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in October that the company was in
            settlement talks that may lead to a deferred prosecution
            agreement. In such deals, the government agrees not to prosecute
            for a specified period and dismisses charges if the entity
            improves its programs or complies with the law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
            resolve government probes that have beset JPMorgan, while
            overhauling internal controls to improve relations with
            regulators. It's among Wall Street firms that have spent years
            fighting off claims brought on behalf of Madoff's victims,
            including accusations that the companies ignored the con man's
            fraud to continue reaping fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has been
            investigating how New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank
            by assets, handled funds controlled by Madoff and whether the
            firm turned a blind eye to his multibillion-dollar fraud, the
            biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
            comment on the settlement talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank listed at least eight Justice Department probes in
            a quarterly filing last month, ranging from the Madoff inquiry
            to investigations of hirings in Asia and its energy-trading
            practices. Weeks later, the firm agreed to a record $13 billion
            settlement to end government investigations of its mortgage-bond
            sales. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said in Talks on $2 Billion Madoff Settlement</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the target of
            multiple U.S. Justice Department investigations, tentatively
            agreed to pay about $2 billion to resolve probes into whether it
            ignored warning signs about Bernard Madoff's crimes, according
            to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also assented to a deferred-prosecution agreement,
            said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            negotiations are private. In such deals, the government agrees
            not to prosecute for a specified period and charges are
            dismissed if the entity improves its programs and complies with
            the law. The talks are in their final stages and the accord
            could be announced before year-end, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
            resolve government probes that have beset JPMorgan, the biggest
            U.S. bank, while overhauling internal controls to improve
            relations with regulators. Wall Street firms have spent years
            fighting off claims brought on behalf of Madoff's victims,
            including accusations that the companies ignored the con man's
            fraud to continue reaping fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the bank's
            primary regulator, and Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
            have been investigating how New York-based JPMorgan handled
            funds controlled by Madoff, whose multibillion-dollar fraud was
            the biggest Ponzi scheme in the nation's history. James Margolin, a Bharara spokesman, and the FBI's Peter
            Donald
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Additional Fines &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OCC, which sanctioned the lender in January for
            violating the Bank Secrecy Act, plans to punish the company for
            BSA violations related to Madoff, according to another person
            briefed on the probe. The OCC also is likely to fine the bank
            for additional anti-money laundering violations, the person
            said. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1970 Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions
            to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money
            laundering, such as reporting cash transactions exceeding
            $10,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in October that a deferred-prosecution agreement was among options the U.S.
            had discussed
            with the bank. The New York Times reported on the tentative $2
            billion accord late yesterday. About half of the penalties will
            go toward resolving the Justice Department's criminal case while
            the rest will be paid to federal bank regulators, the newspaper
            said, citing people briefed on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earlier Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan listed at least eight Justice Department probes in
            a quarterly filing last month, including the Madoff inquiry, and
            investigations into hirings in Asia and the bank's energy-trading practices. Weeks later, the firm agreed to
            a record $13
            billion settlement to end government investigations of its
            mortgage-bond sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan enters a deferred-prosecution agreement in the
            Madoff case, it would be the second time that Attorney General
            Eric Holder has allowed Dimon's bank to avoid prosecution for
            behavior the government has deemed criminal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first was in 2011, when the department granted JPMorgan
            a non-prosecution agreement for its dealings in the municipal
            bond markets. The bank's employees 'entered into unlawful
            agreements to manipulate the bidding process and rig bids on
            municipal investment and related contracts' from 2001 through
            2006, the Justice Department said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Criminal Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In that case, the bank agreed to pay $228 million to
            federal and state agencies and to cooperate in the ongoing
            probe. The investigation resulted in criminal charges against 18
            individuals at firms including JPMorgan. UBS AG (UBSN) and Wells Fargo
            Co.'s Wachovia also agreed to pay penalties and enter into
            non-prosecution agreements over the charges of rigging bids in
            the municipal bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other banks that have entered into non- or deferred-prosecution agreements include London-based
            HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)
            Wachovia's cases focused on conduct before the lender's 2008
            acquisition by Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because a deferred-prosecution agreement or a plea
            agreement involves oversight by a judge, they are better tools
            to fix compliance issues than a non-prosecution agreement that
            is never filed in a court,' said Brandon Garrett, a professor
            at the University of Virginia School of Law who specializes in
            corporte crime. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department is increasingly calling for
            corporate monitors in non- and deferred-prosecution agreements
            to review companies' compliance with the terms of the agreements
            and to ensure corporate reform, according to a 2008 department
            memo on the topic. The corporate monitors are usually employed
            by the firms and approved by the government. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. lender by assets, is forecasting a 30 percent surge in the
            value of mergers and acquisitions the bank expects to handle in
            Asia next year, a rebound from this year's decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Energy companies, financial firms and Asian buyers
            expanding in the U.S. and Europe will drive a surge in activity
            for JPMorgan, said Rob Sivitilli, 41, who has been head of Asian
            MA outside Japan since September 2012. The New York-based bank
            climbed this year to No. 2 among advisers in the region from No.
            4 in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose in deal rankings by improving communication
            between bankers in Asia and colleagues in North America and
            Europe, Sivitilli said. Takeover activity declined this year in
            the region as slowing economies from India to China curbed
            executives' risk appetite. Mergers involving Asian companies may
            fall short of last year's $311 billion after ending last week at
            $298 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have enough visibility on first-quarter and second-quarter activity that leads us to project
            ourselves into a much
            higher level of performance in 2014,' Sivitilli said in a Nov.
            25 interview in Singapore. 'We continue to see further gains in
            market share.' &lt;/p&gt;

            India import at least 80 percent of their oil needs, according to government data. Close

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors surveyed by JPMorgan Chase
            Co. are the most bullish on investment-grade bonds in more
            than nine years as they demand the least relative yields since
            the start of the financial crisis. Arch Coal Inc. plans to raise
            $300 million in a private offering of secured notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 50 percent of investors in the JPMorgan survey are
            overweight investment-grade credit in their portfolio, the most
            since April 2004, meaning they're wagering a larger portion than
            benchmarks, Eric Beinstein, the bank's head of high-grade
            strategy, said today in a research note. About 5 percent of
            respondents are underweight. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The optimistic view on credit comes as the extra cost
            investors demand to hold the debt instead of similar-maturity
            Treasuries touched the lowest in more than six years yesterday,
            according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate
            Index. A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit that reached
            the lowest since November 2007 at the start of the week was
            little changed as growth in retail sales added to speculation
            the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus that's bolstered credit
            markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average relative yield on dollar-denominated,
            investment-grade corporate bonds in the Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch index fell yesterday to 137 basis points, or 1.37
            percentage points, the least since August 2007. The JPMorgan
            analysts are forecasting spreads in their bank's index to
            continue tightening next year by another 15 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Credit Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-grade spreads narrowed 0.3 basis point today,
            Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt tightened 1.1 to 541.6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Junk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors
            Service and lower than BBB- at Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
            to speculate on creditworthiness, held at 70.3 basis points as
            of 5:01 p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by
            Bloomberg. The measure has climbed from 67.3 on Dec. 9, the
            lowest closing level since November 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index has risen as speculation mounts that the Fed is
            gearing up to start reducing $85 billion of monthly bond
            purchases as the economy improves. The share of economists
            predicting the Fed will pare its stimulus in December has
            doubled to 34 percent after a Dec. 6 report showing the
            unemployment rate fell in November to a five-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Taper Speculation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Retail sales rose more than forecast in November as
            Americans bought cars and took advantage of discounts going into
            the holiday-shopping season. Purchases climbed 0.7 percent, the
            most since June, after a 0.6 percent advance in October that was
            larger than previously reported, Commerce Department figures
            showed today. The median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by
            Bloomberg was for a 0.6 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The confidence of debt investors in Computer Sciences Corp (CSC),
            the technology consultant, fell after the company disclosed that
            it may face a regulatory action from the U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission as part of an accounting probe. Credit swaps
            tied to the Falls Church, Virginia-based company's $2.5 billion
            of bonds and loans rose 4.4 basis points to 109.3 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit swaps, which typically rise as investor confidence
            deteriorates and fall as it improves, pay the buyer face value
            if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of
            the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
            contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Arch Coal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arch Coal (ACI) is planning its bond sale as the coal producer
            prepares to redeem shorter-maturity securities. The St. Louis-based company intends to issue second-lien
            notes due in 2019, it
            said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market for corporate borrowing through short-term IOUs
            surged the most in 16 months as demand from money-market mutual
            funds increased. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
            climbed $31.7 billion to $1.081 trillion outstanding in the week
            ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
            That's the biggest jump since an equivalent dollar rise for the
            period ended Aug. 1, 2012, and the highest level since the week
            ended Oct. 30. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Allianz Shares 'Attractive' as Fund Outflows Slow, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Allianz SE (ALV), Europe's
            biggest insurer, are 'attractive' because the pace of fund
            withdrawals at asset management business Pacific Investment
            Management Co. is decreasing, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We note that Pimco net outflows are slowing, and that
            performance of the main total return fund is beginning to
            recover,' Michael Huttner, an analyst at New York-based
            JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed report to clients dated Dec. 13.
            'And we estimate that Pimco concerns are now in the price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has an overweight recommendation on Allianz
            shares. The company climbed 0.6 percent to 123.55 euros at 9:43
            a.m. in Frankfurt, taking this year's gains to 18 percent. The
            benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Insurance index rose 20 percent in
            the period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allianz's asset-management unit, which includes Newport
            Beach, California-based Pimco, reported third-party net outflows
            of 26.7 billion'euros ($36.7 billion) in the third quarter,
            mainly coming from traditional fixed-income products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Higher prices for German motor and house-building insurance
            as well as 'lower claims inflation' are expected to boost non-life pretax operating earnings at Allianz by
            2015, Huttner said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Seek Sale of Global Special Opportunities Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, is seeking to sell a global investment unit in a push
            to simplify operations by paring non-essential holdings, a
            person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan began offering its Global Special Opportunities
            unit, which has about $2 billion in assets, to potential buyers
            in the past few weeks, said the person, who asked not to be
            identified because the talks are confidential. Private-equity
            firms Blackstone Group LP (BX), Carlyle Group LP (CG) and KKR Co. among
            possible bidders for the business, which could fetch $1 billion,
            the Financial Times reported today, citing unidentified people
            familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit, which is based in Hong Kong, employs 35 people
            mostly in Asia and is run by Chris Nicholas. It invests the New
            York-based bank's money in distressed debt, non-performing loans
            and private equity. Federal bank regulators last week approved
            the Volcker Rule, which limits proprietary trading and investing
            by deposit-taking banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're doing a lot of what I call pruning,' Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, told investors at a
            conference last week. 'Simplify, pruning. You should do it all
            the time. Every year, businesses should look at what do I need,
            what don't I need, how do I serve my clients.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has already announced plans to spin off its
            private-equity unit, sell most of its physical commodities
            business and exit student lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
            to comment, as did Carlyle's Randy Whitestone and KKR's Kristi Huller. A Blackstone spokesman didn't
            immediately respond to
            messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan 10% Increase in Number of Junior Bankers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. plans to boost the number of junior investment bankers it employs by about 10
            percent and provide them with 'protected weekends' to reduce their workload, a person familiar with the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeff Urwin, the New York-based company's global head of investment banking,
            announced the changes on an internal conference call today, said the person, who didn't say how many people
            would be affected and asked not to be identified because the new policies aren't public. Jennifer
            Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the major Wall
            Street firms are planning to increase investment-banking staff in 2014, according to Jeanne Branthover, the
            head of financial-services recruitment at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York. They are also trying
            to protect their best employees from poaching as average pay at the biggest banks declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Business
            is better and they've stayed lean for so long,' Branthover said. 'People are burned out.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., which lowered the amount it set aside for employee compensation by 5 percent in the first
            nine months of the year, said in October that it was discouraging investment-banking analysts from working
            weekends. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Trial of Len Blavatnik's Suit Against JPMorgan Ends</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Leonard Blavatnik's
            lawyers asked a New York judge to hold JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            responsible for stuffing a fund with risky mortgage securities
            and losing 10 percent of his $1 billion investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, ranked 49th on Bloomberg's billionaires
            index with a net worth of $16.2 billion, sued JPMorgan in New
            York state court in June 2009, accusing the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets of putting more money into mortgage securities in his
            CMMF fund than investment guidelines allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard I. Werder Jr., an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
            Urquhart Sullivan LLP who is representing Blavatnik, today
            asked Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer to order JPMorgan
            to pay more than $100 million in damages to the billionaire for
            the losses to the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're talking about this account being converted into a
            totally different kind of account than the one it was supposed
            to be,' Werder said during closing arguments in a two-week,
            nonjury trial in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Attorneys for New York-based JPMorgan have argued that CMMF
            rejected the 'most conservative strategy' it was offered in
            favor of one that sought a higher return than a money-market
            fund, with higher risk and less liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lewis R. Clayton, an attorney with Paul Weiss Rifkind
            Wharton Garrison LLP, representing JPMorgan, told Schweitzer
            today that the losses were the result of unexpected market
            conditions and that the mortgage securities purchased for the
            fund were 'remarkably liquid' until the financial crisis hit
            in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is classic backward-looking, after-the-fact second-
            guessing,' Clayton said during his closing argument. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schweitzer didn't indicate when he planned to rule. Werder
            said he expected a decision within several months, while Clayton
            declined to comment after today's proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management
            Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Alain Grisay, Ex-JPMorgan Manager Who Led F&amp;amp;C Asset, Dies at 59</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Alain Grisay, a former JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) managing director who later oversaw a series of mergers as
            chief executive officer at FC Asset Management Plc, operator of
            the U.K.'s oldest investment fund, has died. He was 59. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He died over the weekend, according to a statement from
            Darty Plc, a London-based home-appliance retailer of which
            Grisay was a nonexecutive director. No cause was given. He lived
            in London for almost three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Belgian-born fund manager who spent 22 years at
            JPMorgan and raced a 1931 Invicta sports car as a hobby, moved
            through the ranks of the New York-based investment bank,
            eventually heading its European fixed-income division, according
            to a 2010 article in the Financial Times. In 2001, he joined FC
            as head of its European institutional business in London and was
            CEO from 2006 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, Bank of Montreal agreed to buy the company for
            708 million pounds ($1.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FC traces its roots to 1868, when Foreign Colonial
            Investment Trust became the world's first publicly listed pooled
            investment vehicle, according to FC's website. FC Management
            became a stand-alone asset manager in 1972 to oversee the
            portfolio of Foreign Colonial Investment Trust. The parent
            company gained its stock listing in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Alain was a visionary executive and business leader,'
            the company said in an e-mailed statement. 'Alain will be sadly
            missed by all of us who had the privilege of both knowing him
            and of working together.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FC Years &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Grisay's appointment as CEO, he presided over FC's
            merger with real-estate investment firm REIT Asset Management in
            2008; its breakup the following year with U.K. life insurer
            Friends Provident Plc, which distributed its 52 percent stake in
            FC to shareholders; and the purchase of Thames River Capital in
            2010. He also supervised FC's agreement to start a joint-venture in China with Hua Xia Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grisay stepped down in 2012, handing over management duties
            to Edward Bramson, founder of activist shareholding company,
            Sherborne Investors LLC, who replaced Nick MacAndrew as FC
            chairman in 2011. Bramson had criticized FC's costs, levels of
            debt and acquisitions. Grisay had urged investors to reject
            Sherborne's plans to develop a new strategy for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a statement on Grisay's departure, Bramson said the
            former CEO had 'achieved the successful acquisition of Thames
            River and steered the company through the most tumultuous period
            of market upheaval for 60 years.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Johns Hopkins &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A self-described Anglophile, Grisay shook up FC by
            removing six layers of management, reduced the number of
            investment committees and transferred some of the powers of the
            chief investment officer to the fund managers themselves,
            according to a 2006 profile in the U.K.'s Independent newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alain Leopold Grisay was born on April 5, 1954, according
            to Who's Who of Company Directors. He earned a master's in law
            from the University of Louvain in Belgium, and a Master of Arts
            degree in international affairs from Johns Hopkins University in
            Baltimore, the Independent said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grisay joined J.P. Morgan Co. in 1979 as a financial
            analyst in New York. In 2000, the bank merged with Chase
            Manhattan Corp. to become JPMorgan Chase. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After moving to FC, Grisay became deputy CEO and chairman
            of the company's Dutch unit, where he remained until 2004, when
            FC merged with the U.K. asset-management company Isis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It required some reasonably tough management to sort that
            out,' Grisay said of the Isis merger, according to the
            Financial Times. 'I was asked to run the business in 2006 with
            a clear view to clean up the damage.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Rental Rush For Wealthy Clients: Mortgages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is giving its wealthiest clients the chance to invest in the single-family
            rental market after other investments linked to the U.S. housing recovery jumped in value. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            firm's unit that caters to individuals and families with more than $5 million, put client money in a
            partnership that bought more than 5,000 single family homes to rent in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and
            California, said David Lyon, a managing director and investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
            Investors can expect returns of as much as 8 percent annually from rental income as well as part of the
            profits when the homes are sold, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank's wealthy clients are joining a
            growing number of private-equity firms and individuals buying rental homes in the regions hardest hit by the
            U.S. housing crash. Blackstone Group LP (BX) has spent $2.7 billion, and said last month it accelerated
            purchases as home prices rise faster than anticipated. Even after home values in November gained by the most
            in six years, investors are wagering on rental properties as an alternative to housing-related stocks and
            mortgage debt that's already soared. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The traditional places people might look --
            homebuilder stocks and appliance makers -- probably aren't the best places for new investments,' said John
            Buckingham, chief investment officer at Al Frank Asset Management in Aliso Viejo, California, which oversees
            about $4.5 billion. 'They've had fantastic runs.' &lt;/p&gt;

            and raising concern among analysts including Michael Widner of Stifel Nicolaus Co. that growth is already

            &lt;p&gt;The biggest investment-grade bond
            loss in 14 months is bolstering Bank of America Corp. (BAC)'s view
            that the unprecedented bull market in the notes is over.
            JPMorgan Chase Co. disagrees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With bonds of the most-creditworthy borrowers from the U.S.
            to Europe and Asia losing 0.8 percent in January, Bank of
            America strategist Hans Mikkelsen cut his forecast for
            investment-grade debt returns last week, saying a sustained
            shift away from notes will cause borrowing costs to soar. At
            JPMorgan, Eric Beinstein said he's skeptical bond losses will
            deepen because the biggest debt buyers are unlikely to switch to
            equities and central banks will keep supporting the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Debt strategists at the two biggest U.S. banks are coming
            into conflict after a 44 percent rally since 2008 left yields at
            a record-low 2.55 percent in December and the best start to a
            year for stocks in two decades added $2.6 trillion to their
            market value. JPMorgan anticipates more government stimulus that
            bolsters credit as the International Monetary Fund lowers its
            forecast for global growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Despite concerns about a potential rotation out of
            credit, demand for investment-grade debt will continue to be
            supported,' Greg Hall, managing director in debt capital
            markets at Barclays Plc in New York, wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, UBS Tricked Milan in Swaps Case, Judge Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and Depfa Bank Plc took advantage of the city of
            Milan, tricking the municipality into agreeing to a financing
            deal that didn't meet its objective of cutting borrowing costs,
            wrote the judge who convicted the four banks in the fraud case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks should have informed the municipality of the
            charges related to the derivatives that were part of the
            transactions, Judge Oscar Magi in Milan wrote today in
            explaining the convictions he handed down in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The city, which 'wasn't up to' carrying out its own
            analysis of the economic advantage of the financing package,
            needed protection and clear information, Magi said.
            'Information deficiencies manifested themselves and caused a
            grave asymmetry of information,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks, whose employees involved in the case were
            registered with Britain's Financial Services Authority, violated
            U.K. rules by failing to inform the city that it was a
            counterparty to the lenders rather than a customer. The banks
            acted as arrangers of a bond sale, or advisers to the
            municipality, as well as its counterparties, the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When contacted by Bloomberg News, the banks said they
            disagree with the verdict and plan to appeal, reiterating their
            stance following the December ruling. Chris Hamilton, a
            spokesman for the FSA in London, declined to immediately
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magi in December ordered that about 90 million euros ($122
            million) of assets be seized from the banks, the amount of their
            profit, and that they pay sanctions of 1 million euros each. He
            also convicted nine bankers of fraud and suspended their
            sentences. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge said Italian securities rules indicate that there
            is an obligation to disclose the cost of derivatives to the
            client, a duty that in this case was reinforced by the multiple
            roles played by the banks. Under FSA rules, banks are required
            to shield customers from conflicts of interest and failed to
            inform Milan of the 'obvious' conflict, Magi wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contracts, given the amounts involved, are likely to
            have been vetted by the most senior managers of the banks,
            according to Magi. The bankers then 'executed' directives they
            were given, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's $543 Million Madoff Trustee Settlement Approved</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $543 million settlement with the trustee for Bernard Madoff's defunct
            firm was approved by the judge overseeing its liquidation, ending a case in which thousands of investors
            accused the bank of turning a blind eye to the U.S.'s biggest Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord,
            reached Jan. 7, was approved today by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in New York. The deal resolves
            a lawsuit by the trustee, Irving Picard, and two related class-action cases filed by Madoff victims who
            accused the bank of negligence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The settlements are fair, reasonable and in the best
            interest of the Madoff estate,' Bernstein said. The deals provide 'substantial benefit' to victims, he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Madoff Ex-Aides Seen Facing Hurdle With 'Duped' Defense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With
            the JPMorgan deal, Picard's recoveries for victims topped $10 billion, or 59 percent of the $17 billion in
            principal lost by thousands of customers in Madoff's investment advisory business. Picard alleged the bank
            helped perpetuate Madoff's scam for years by ignoring signs of fraud. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Madoff deposited
            money from new customers into the account instead of investing it in securities, and made withdrawals to pay
            back earlier investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed after Madoff's confession and arrest in December 2008.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard said New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, ignored signs of wrongdoing
            to benefit financially from the con man's business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Class Actions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            agreed to pay Picard $325 million to settle his lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims, and another $218
            million to resolve two related class-action lawsuits that were filed with Picard's assistance after an
            appeals court barred him from bringing common-law claims against the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard had
            appealed the JPMorgan decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which hasn't decided whether it will hear the
            case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amount of the accord 'indicated there was a value to the claims and the
            compromise made good sense,' David Sheehan, a lawyer for Picard, said at today's hearing. There is no
            guarantee Picard will win at the Supreme Court, Sheehan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A group of about 200
            Madoff victims who are 'net winners' -- customers who withdrew more money from the scam than they deposited
            -- get nothing under the deal and have said in court filings they will sue the bank. They advised Bernstein
            in court papers that they were declining to be part of the JPMorgan accord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Opting Out
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You're opting out of a class you're not a member of -- sounds like a Groucho Marx
            joke,' Bernstein said to a lawyer for the group at today's hearing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picard is pursuing
            claims totaling about $3.5 billion from UBS AG (UBSN), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and UniCredit SpA (UCG),
            which the trustee has also accused of benefiting from Madoff's fraud. The banks have denied the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time Picard reached the deal with JPMorgan, the bank agreed to pay $1.7 billion to the
            U.S. to resolve related criminal allegations, and $350 million in a case by the Office of the Comptroller of
            the Currency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal investigators have
            resulted in a total recovery for victims of almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard
            has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions more held in reserve until legal issues are
            resolved. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence
            at a federal prison in North Carolina. At least seven others pleaded guilty, including his brother Peter
            Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Picower Estate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the
            JPMorgan accord, Picard's team had recovered $9.5 billion through lawsuits and out-of-court settlements,
            including $5 billion from the estate of Jeffry Picower, who began investing with Madoff in the 1970s.
            Picower, whom Picard called the biggest beneficiary of Madoff's scheme, had a heart attack and drowned in a
            pool in Florida in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. investigators had recovered about $2.3 billion for
            Madoff investors before reaching their deal with JPMorgan, including $2.2 billion from Picower's estate and
            $100 million from Madoff's Midtown Manhattan penthouse apartment and other belongings. The JPMorgan deal
            brings total U.S. recoveries to $4 billion -- a sum it will distribute through a separate process from the
            one used by Picard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
            Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-bk-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
            York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Euro to Test 3-Year Yen High, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The euro may rally to its highest
            level against the yen in more than three years after breaking
            through a 2011 high, according to JPMorgan Chase and Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 17-nation currency will target a level of 127.95/128.50
            yen per euro, near the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement of the
            decline from the June 2009 peak, Niall O'Connor, a technical
            analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a note to clients. The
            shared currency, which has gained 23 percent versus the yen
            during the past three months, will find support at 123.20 after
            breaking through 'the important 123.35 high from 2011,'
            O'Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The yen weakness story is very much still intact and
            there is no sign of a reversal,' O'Connor said in a telephone
            interview from New York. 'One twenty-eight is the next big
            target zone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro gained 1.5 percent to 126.72 at 12:20 p.m. in New
            York after falling as much as 1.6 percent yesterday, the biggest
            intra-day drop since Jan. 2. The euro last reached 128.50 yen on
            Jan. 20, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
            of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
            security, commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an
            area on a chart where buy orders may be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
            mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
            on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
            after reaching a new high or low. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) entered
            exclusive talks to sell its physical commodities unit to
            Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. as the bank seeks to end a five-year
            foray into owning and storing materials such as metals and oil,
            according to two people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bid from Geneva-based Mercuria beat offers from
            Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) and Blackstone Group LP (BX), said one person,
            who asked not to be identified because the discussions are
            private. Blythe Masters, JPMorgan's commodities chief, probably
            won't join Mercuria as part of the deal, which is still being
            negotiated, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling the unit as regulators examine whether
            catastrophic losses at federally backed banks could endanger the
            financial system and lawmakers question whether firms have the
            power to manipulate some prices. The Federal Reserve said in
            July it might force insured lenders to get out of the business,
            and New York-based JPMorgan agreed later that month to pay $410
            million for claims that it manipulated power markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Mercuria and JPMorgan declined to comment, as
            did spokesmen for New York-based Blackstone and Sydney-based
            Macquarie. Reuters reported on the exclusive talks earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Morgan Stanley in Settling U.S. Mortgage Lawsuits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) agreed to pay $1.86 billion to end U.S. accusations of
            misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
            securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said yesterday it reached a $1.25 billion
            deal to end Federal Housing Finance Agency claims the bank sold
            faulty mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) before the
            firms' losses pushed them into U.S. conservatorship. JPMorgan
            will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted ineligible
            loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Affairs
            insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan 'put profits ahead of responsibility by
            recklessly churning out thousands of defective mortgage loans,
            failing to inform the government of known problems with those
            loans and leaving the government to cover the losses,'
            Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The six largest U.S. lenders have allocated more than $114
            billion since the financial crisis to cover legal expenses,
            government probes and mortgage-related claims. Morgan Stanley's
            deal with the FHFA prompted the New York-based bank to book an
            additional $150 million charge in the fourth quarter, reducing
            earnings for the period by 5 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s commodities head, withdrew from an advisory committee of
            the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission a day after her appointment was disclosed, according to two
            people with direct knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The regulator may include another
            executive from New York-based JPMorgan on the global markets committee, said one person close to the bank
            who requested anonymity because the move hasn't been publicly announced. Masters, 44, stepped down because
            the company's sale of its physical commodities unit will keep her occupied, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            is selling a division that deals in assets such as metals and oil, as government watchdogs examine whether
            federally backed lenders should be involved in such markets. Masters's appointment drew criticism from
            Twitter users who questioned the propriety of her advising the regulator of futures and swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Masters, whose name appeared on a list of committee members on the CFTC's website yesterday, had
            been scheduled to participate in a Feb. 12 meeting to discuss cross-border guidance on rules. She was
            invited to the panel by acting Chairman Mark Wetjen, said one of the people. Her name has since been removed
            from the list. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Offer Bad Debt as BlackRock Plans HSBC Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase Co. is offering $390
            million of non-performing loans as banks including HSBC Holdings
            Plc and Regions Financial Corp. increasingly look to sell
            troubled mortgage debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan put the pool of debt, a portion of which is tied
            to residential properties in New York, on the market this week,
            said two people with knowledge of the offering, who asked not to
            be named because the sale is private. HSBC hired BlackRock Inc.
            to manage the potential sale of as much as $1 billion in
            delinquent loans and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is handling an
            auction of about $700 million of modified loans for Regions,
            according to two separate people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of the debt are accelerating amid financial
            regulations that force banks to pledge more capital for some
            assets they hold, including non-performing loans, or NPLs. The
            government also is adding to the supply as it auctions the debt
            to help prevent foreclosures and stem losses at the Federal
            Housing Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Banks have made a decision internally that a delinquent
            borrower is not a core customer,'Ashish Pandey, chief
            executive officer of Altisource Residential Corp. (RESI), said at a
            conference in Las Vegas last month. Pandey, whose firm had 6,300
            delinquent loans as of the third quarter of 2013, said he
            expects as many as 500,000 non-performing loans to sell in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, GE Sell Least Samurai as Tight Spreads Deter Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and General
            Electric Co. (GE)'s finance arm had their smallest Samurai-bond sales
            in more than nine years as a global stock rout damped investor
            demand for debt that offered investors record-low yields. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;General Electric Capital Corp. sold 55 billion yen ($536
            million) in three-year fixed-rate, yen-denominated notes that
            pay 0.313 percent on Feb. 6, while JPMorgan offered 48.5 billion
            yen in a two-tranche deal, including three-year fixed-rate notes
            offering 0.373 percent. Those rates are the lowest ever paid by
            the companies on the yen-denominated debt, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese investors are wary of buying overseas debt
            offering such low yields after concerns that the Chinese economy
            is slowing and the impact from U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus
            cuts triggered a selloff in emerging-market currencies and
            global stocks. JPMorgan joined Morgan Stanley last week in
            agreeing to pay $1.86 billion to settle U.S. accusations of
            misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
            securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
            global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Compared with notes from local issuers, Samurai bonds are
            more exposed to overseas risk,' said Yoshihiro Nakatani, a
            Tokyo-based senior fund manager who oversees about 100 billion
            yen of bonds at Asahi Life Asset Management Co. 'Spreads on
            Samurai have fallen to unattractive levels, and it will be
            difficult for Japanese investors to buy at the kind of rates
            offered by JPMorgan and GE in future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Spread 'Unattractive' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakatani, who has invested in GE Capital's debt in the
            past, said he didn't buy the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
            company's notes this time because the spread was
            'unattractive.' He doesn't invest in U.S. banks like JPMorgan
            as they can be affected more by financial regulation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tom Steiner, a London-based spokesman for GE Capital,
            declined to comment on the company's sale. Yukako Yoshino, a
            spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Tokyo, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last had a Samurai sale smaller than last week's
            in September 2004, when it issued 25 billion yen in notes,
            following two bigger sales the same year, according to
            Bloomberg-compiled data. General Electric hasn't had a smaller
            sale, according to the data going back to 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE Capital sold 95 billion yen of Samurai notes in
            September, including 72.1 billion yen in debt also 10 basis
            points over yen swaps. The spread on securities of the same
            length offered last week declined to 4 basis points. A basis
            point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan issued 105.6 billion yen of Samurai bonds in June,
            including 51.5 billion yen in three-year notes at 10 basis
            points over swaps, the same level as last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Falling Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average spread on Samurais was at 41 basis points on
            Feb. 6, the least since November 2007, according to Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE is rated AA+ by Standard Poor's, its second-highest
            ranking, and four levels above the A grade it gives JPMorgan.
            SP lowered its outlook on JPMorgan to negative from stable in
            June, saying that the likelihood of 'extraordinary' government
            support for the U.S. bank is waning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Topix index of Japanese shares has fallen 8.7 percent
            this year after a 52 percent gain in 2013. The gauge rose on
            Feb. 7 to pare a fifth straight week of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Stock prices are falling and investors are worried, so
            they aren't going after credit investments,' said Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas in
            Tokyo, in a
            telephone interview. 'There's very little incentive to make
            investments at such low levels at a difficult time to assess
            risk.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Seller &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. seller of Samurai bonds since
            the global financial crisis, issuing 426.7 billion yen of the
            notes from 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            General Electric is the second largest, at 370.7 billion yen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuers from Australia to Norway have raised about 370
            billion yen via Samurai sales this year, up from 60 billion for
            the entire first quarter of last year. National Australia Bank
            Ltd. is the biggest issuer of the securities this year, having
            sold 123.8 billion yen last month. Norway's DNB Bank ASA sold
            81.6 billion yen also in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Following the emerging-market shock, and possibility of
            spreads widening for overseas names, there appears to have been
            a feeling that there wasn't a need to rush to buy GE Capital's
            Samurai this time,' said Yusuke Ueda, a Tokyo-based credit
            analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For JPMorgan, 'the
            tone seems to have been a little different' and the bank had
            less of a need to sell Samurai debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted
            ineligible loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
            Affairs insurance, according to a statement on Feb. 4 by the
            U.S. Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement the same day that the
            'settlement represents another significant step in the firm's
            efforts to put historical mortgage-related issues behind it.'
            The bank separately agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle
            Federal Housing Finance Agency claims related to about $33
            billion in mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Under normal circumstances, JPMorgan probably would have
            liked to sell a lot, lot more bonds' at a premium of as little
            as 10 basis points, said BNP's Nakazora said. 'It's litigation
            risk has been very big.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's $13 Billion Accord Seen Needing Court Review</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $13 billion
            fraud settlement with the U.S. government should be blocked
            until a court is able to review it, a Wall Street watchdog group
            founded by an Atlanta hedge fund manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets Inc. is seeking judicial scrutiny of the
            accord because it's the largest settlement 'with a single
            entity in the 237-year history of the U.S.,' according to a
            complaint filed today in Washington federal court. 'No one has
            any ability to determine if the $13 billion agreement is fair'
            or 'if it is a sweetheart deal,' the group said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord, announced in November, settled allegations that
            the biggest U.S. lender by assets misled investors and the
            public when it sold bonds backed by faulty residential
            mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed JPMorgan's actions
            for helping to cause the credit crisis, and said the agreement
            didn't shield JPMorgan or its employees from possible charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department 'acted as investigator, prosecutor,
            judge, juror, sentencer and collector,' Dennis Kelleher, chief
            executive officer of Better Markets, said at a press conference
            in Washington. The agreement was 'mostly designed to conceal,
            not reveal.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The department is confident that the settlement reached
            with JPMorgan Chase complies with the law,' Ellen Canale, a
            Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Financial Reform' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets describes itself as 'a nonprofit,
            nonpartisan organization that promotes the public interest in
            financial reform.' It was founded by Michael Masters, founder
            and managing member of Atlanta-based Masters Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group expects that its standing to bring the complaint
            will be challenged, Kelleher said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It will be hotly contested but I believe we have a solid
            foundation to prove and demonstrate concrete and demonstrable
            harm that give us ample standing to assert both the
            constitutional claims and the statutory claims,' Kelleher said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If we do not, what that means is that no one in the
            United States can ever challenge a backroom deal like this cut
            by any attorney general,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets' standing derives from its public interest
            purpose being thwarted by a lack of transparency in the
            settlement process and the lack of a 'judicial forum in which
            it could seek to participate to influence' the outcome, the
            group said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Novel Claim' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint doesn't cite any precedents for challenges to
            similar Justice Department settlements with banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think it's fair to call it a novel claim,' driven by
            uniquely damaging and far-reaching circumstances, Kelleher said
            in a phone interview following his press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least one portion of the settlement, a $2 billion civil
            penalty obtained under the Financial Institutions Reform,
            Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, explicitly
            required a court to levy the sanction, according to the
            complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better Markets also alleged that the Justice Department and
            U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder 'have an apparent conflict of
            interest' because they have been criticized for failing to be
            tough enough on large Wall Street firms and 'have aggressively
            used the $13 billion agreement to try to restore their
            reputations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement is 'a mere contract' whereby JPMorgan
            agreed to pay 'in exchange for complete civil immunity from DOJ
            for years of pervasive, egregious and knowing alleged fraud and
            other illegal conduct related to the worst financial crash in
            the U.S. since 1929,' according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Better Markets Inc. v. U.S. Department of
            Justice, 14-cv-00190, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
            (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ryan Crane, JPMorgan Equities Trading Executive, Dies at 37</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ryan Crane, a JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co.
            employee who in a 14-year career at the New York-based bank rose
            to executive director of a unit that trades blocks of stocks for
            clients, has died. He was 37. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He died on Feb. 3 at his Stamford, Connecticut, home,
            according to the website of Leo P. Gallagher Son Funeral Home
            in Greenwich, Connecticut. The cause of death will be determined
            when a toxicology report is completed in about six weeks, said a
            spokeswoman for the state's chief medical examiner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crane started at JPMorgan in equities trading after
            graduating from Harvard University in 1999, according to his
            profile on the LinkedIn Corp. website. Following promotions, he
            worked as an executive director, or a rank above vice president
            and below managing director, in the bank's Americas Program
            Trading group. Program traders handle transactions in baskets of
            at least 15 stocks, often for mutual-fund clients seeking to
            rebalance index-linked portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ryan was a beloved colleague who will be dearly missed,'
            Justin Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in an e-mailed
            statement. 'Our thoughts and sympathy are with his family and
            friends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ryan Henry Crane was born on Jan. 8, 1977, to Mary Jo and
            Lex Crane. He grew up in Long Valley, New Jersey, and in 1995
            graduated from the Delbarton School in Morristown, New Jersey,
            where he was recognized as Scholar-Athlete of the Year as a
            senior and named to the All-American Lacrosse Team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he earned a letter
            in lacrosse and a bachelor's degree in European history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He was known as the 'Gentle Giant' by his friends and
            family,' according to the funeral home's death notice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Survivors include his wife, the former Lauren Pizzotti, and
            son, Harry. He is also survived by a brother, Lex, of Denver; a
            sister, Allison, of Arvada, Colorado; and his parents, of Long
            Valley, according to the funeral home. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Companies Squeeze 401K Plans From Facebook to JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Employers are squeezing their workers' retirement savings, holding back on both the amount and the
            timing of 401(k) matching funds and dragging out vesting schedules. Taken together, these measures are
            making it more difficult to save for old age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Major companies that have engaged in such
            practices in recent years include Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFM), Facebook Inc., Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Caesars
            Entertainment Corp. and JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most frugal have been scaling back
            company matches and setting lower limits for the maximum annual payment they'll make to a 401(k) account,
            according to hundreds of government filings analyzed by Bloomberg. A difference of three percentage points
            on a match can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost for employees over the course of their
            careers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;America's Retirement Gap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'There's been an implicit contract
            for years and years -- workers save and companies match -- but now they're changing the rules,' said
            Brigitte Madrian, a Harvard Kennedy School professor who studies retirement policy and corporate management.
            'Most individuals can't do it on their own. We're going in the wrong direction.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies
            including International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard Co. say their 401(k) policies are
            partially dictated by bottom-line considerations and marketplace competition. Others say that when setting
            their 401(k) contributions, they consider a wide range of benefits and their costs as well as employee
            preferences, including health care, vacation policy and incentives such as performance bonuses, stock
            options and outright grants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Choosing Benefits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In addition to our
            401(k) plan, we offer benefits that our more than 80,000 Team Members have the opportunity to actually vote
            on, including paying only $0-$15 per paycheck for health insurance premiums, robust store discounts, and
            paid time off that carries over,' Mark Ehrnstein, global vice president of Team Member Services at Whole
            Foods, said in an e-mail. 'We offer other benefits such as a broad-based stock plan that awards 95 percent
            of options to non-executives, and we have a gain-sharing program that rewards teams for labor productivity.'

        <headline>JPMorgan Employee Falls to Death From Building Roof in Hong Kong</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) employee fell
            to his death from the roof of Chater House, the investment
            bank's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A sad and tragic incident occurred in Chater House, Hong
            Kong, which is currently being investigated by the police,'
            JPMorgan said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The bank
            declined to comment further 'out of respect for those involved.
            Our thoughts and sympathy are with the family that's involved at
            this difficult point of time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Hong Kong police official, who asked not to be identified
            in line with the agency's policy, said the person was certified
            dead at the hospital. The man was a junior employee in a
            supporting function who didn't work as a trader or investment
            banker, said a JPMorgan employee who asked not to be identified
            because they weren't authorized to release the information until
            the man's family overseas are contacted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A Chinese male in his thirties' was found in front of
            the building at about 1:55 p.m. yesterday, Lee Kwok Wing, senior
            manager for security and support services of building owner
            Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd., said at the scene. The building at
            8 Connaught Road Central is 30 stories high, according to
            Hongkong Land's website. JPMorgan occupies the top 10 floors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other building tenants include Franklin Templeton
            Investment Funds, Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., Pictet Asset
            Management (HK) Ltd. and Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last month, a 39-year-old vice president in technology
            operations died after falling from JPMorgan's London
            headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said Cut Tie to Saudi Bank Amid Focus on Control</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) dropped Al-Rajhi Bank, the world's largest Shariah-compliant lender, as a
            correspondent banking client amid a push to improve risk controls, said two people with direct knowledge of
            the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The relationship with Saudi Arabia's biggest publicly traded bank ended Dec.
            31 because JPMorgan couldn't get enough information on where payments in dollar-clearing services for
            Al-Rajhi had originated, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the decision wasn't public.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it cut off the service to about 500 foreign lenders last year as
            regulators press the world's biggest banks to verify that transactions are used for legitimate business. The
            crackdown seeks to halt funds tied to money laundering, terrorism and countries covered by economic
            sanctions. Correspondent accounts allow lenders to take deposits or make payments on behalf of foreign
            institutions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan has to be extra careful to make sure they're adhering to
            standards and not even approaching anything questionable,' said David Kass, a professor at the University of
            Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two banks haven't been cited by U.S.
            regulators for involvement in illegal money transfers. Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
            comment on clients of the company, which is based in New York and ranks as the nation's largest lender by
            assets. A spokesman for Al-Rajhi (RJHI) didn't respond to inquiries, and there was no response to messages
            sent to the firm's Riyadh headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ilan Ganot, a hedge fund banker at
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), left his life in finance to create a new
            business model aimed at developing drugs more quickly. His son's
            life may depend on his success. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since his 2-year-old was diagnosed a year ago with Duchenne
            muscular dystrophy, a fatal genetic disease, Ganot quit his job
            in London, moved his family to the Boston area, raised $17
            million and founded a biotechnology company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ganot, 40, a former Israeli army captain, is one of a
            generation of parents who are stepping in when medicine and
            industry don't move fast enough to save their children. Instead
            of the usual approach of forming or supporting an advocacy
            group, Ganot is using his roots in finance to start a business
            aimed at getting treatments to market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He's a really exceptional example of a parent who says,
            'I'm going to take my skills and apply them to this problem,''
            said Sharon Hesterlee, vice president of research at Parent
            Project Muscular Dystrophy, a nonprofit focused on the disease.
            'You want them to solve world peace after this.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ganot would settle for making a difference in the disease
            afflicting his son, Eytani. There's no cure for Duchenne
            muscular dystrophy, which occurs when the body fails to produce
            a protein called dystrophin that supports muscle fiber strength.
            DMD puts kids in wheelchairs before their teens and is often
            fatal in their 20s. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. Fed Retreats From Interest-Rate Threshold as Unemployment
            Falls &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve policy makers backed
            away from their year-old commitment to consider raising interest
            rates when unemployment falls below 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. JPMorgan Employee Falls to Death From Building Roof in Hong
            Kong &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- A JPMorgan Chase Co. employee fell
            to his death from the roof of Chater House, the investment
            bank's Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Facebook to Buy Mobile-Message App WhatsApp for $19 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Facebook Inc., the world's largest
            social network, agreed to purchase mobile-messaging startup
            WhatsApp Inc. for as much as $19 billion in cash and stock, the
            biggest Internet acquisition in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;4. Currency Traders Facing Extinction as Computers Replace
            Humans &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- A widening probe of the foreign-exchange market is roiling an industry
            already under pressure to
            reduce costs as computer platforms displace human traders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;5. Zuckerberg Bonded With WhatsApp CEO Over Coffee and Dinners &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) -- The relationship between Facebook
            Inc. and WhatsApp Inc. started in spring 2012 over coffee at a
            German bakery. It was consummated on Valentine's Day with
            chocolate-covered strawberries, after just five days of talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;6. Stocks Fall With Treasuries as Dollar Gains on Fed Minutes,
            IMF &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks fell with Treasuries,
            while the dollar gained, as Federal Reserve meeting minutes
            indicated stimulus cuts would likely continue in measured steps
            and the International Monetary Fund warned of risks to global
            growth. Ukraine's bonds tumbled, while U.S. natural gas jumped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;7. RBS Says No Big Job Cuts Coming as Investment Bank to Shrink &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
            Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan moved to reassure employees
            that there will be 'no big announcement' on job cuts when the
            lender publishes the results of its strategic review next week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;8. Wall Street Bond Dealers Renounce Treasuries That Lure Pimco &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- The world's biggest bond dealers are
            showing almost no confidence in the best annual start for
            Treasuries since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;9. Facebook $21-Per-Eyeball Offer Underscores WhatsApp's Appeal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Dan Stiller isn't using Facebook
            much anymore. Mark Zuckerberg is paying $42 to get him back. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10. Worsening Divorce Rate Points to Improving U.S. Growth:
            Economy &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Hard economic times had kept Amy
            Derose and her husband Lawrence locked in an unhappy marriage
            for the sake of their engineering firm in Pompano Beach,
            Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. China's Mystery GDP Should Have G-7 Firing Italy: William
            Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) -- China's thought police have a new
            target in their sights: economists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. China Is the Dupe as Dollar Pyramid Scheme Grows: William
            Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Reading Eswar Prasad's new book,
            it's easy to picture the entire global economy as a giant bird
            cage, with Jack Lew and Janet Yellen standing outside waving at
            all the unwitting creatures inside. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Sex Isn't the Political Killer It Used to Be: Margaret
            Carlson &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Traffic is the new sex. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Pre-Teen Pornographer and Other Facebook Likes: William D.
            Cohan &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- I have always been deeply troubled
            by the fact that more than a billion people willingly share, for
            free, endless amounts of information about themselves and the
            people they care about with Mark Zuckerberg Co. over at
            Facebook, and then allow Zuckerberg to mine that data and sell
            the relevant bits and pieces to advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Weapons Expert Sees No Chance of Iran Success: Jeffrey
            Goldberg &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Until recently, Gary Samore was the
            Barack Obama administration's top expert on weapons of mass
            destruction and the go-to White House official on the
            complexities and challenges of the Iranian nuclear program. So I
            pay attention when he says that the Iran nuclear talks --
            restarting today -- have an almost zero chance of success. &lt;/p&gt;

            danger from avalanches. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Rates DP World at Buy Before Upgrade: Islamic Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. says investors
            should buy record-low yielding sukuk from Dubai-based port
            operator DP World Ltd. (DPW) and Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority FZE
            before credit ratings improve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on DP World's $1.5 billion Islamic bonds due July
            2017 slid 61 basis points this year to 2.6 percent at 2:22 p.m.
            in Dubai, the lowest level since they were sold in 2007. The
            yield on Jafza's sukuk maturing two years later fell 32 basis
            points. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, which rate
            DP World the lowest investment grade and business-park operator
            Jafza junk, could raise both in 2014, JPMorgan said in a note
            Feb. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai issuers are benefiting from an economic resurgence in
            the Gulf business hub that's boosting balance sheets, driving
            funding costs lower and helping companies pay debt early. Emaar
            Properties PJSC's Islamic bond yields fell the most in more than
            four months after the emirate's biggest developer was raised by
            Standard Poor's Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue seeing tangible credit momentum in Dubai'
            almost without exception, Zafar Nazim, a credit analyst at
            JPMorgan Securities Ltd., said by phone Feb. 20. Companies are
            paying off debt backed by 'strong cash flows,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deep-Sea Port &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DP World lowered its net leverage by more than half since
            its last upgrade three years ago, according to JPMorgan. At the
            same time it invested in projects including London Gateway, a
            new deep-sea port in the U.K. Jafza was raised to two steps
            below investment grade by Moody's in October after making
            progress in reducing debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jafza may not get to investment grade but they're on
            course for an upgrade with Moody's given their deleveraging
            trajectory,' Nazim said. 'DP World was last upgraded in 2011
            using 2010 numbers. Back in 2010 the world was still going
            through a tight spot.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moody's said yesterday it doesn't comment on speculation
            regarding future rating actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sukuk were among securities caught up in a developing
            markets selloff last year when the U.S. said it would reduce its
            $85 billion per-month bond-purchasing program. The yield on
            Jafza's debt climbed to as high as 5.84 percent June 26, while
            that on DP World's notes rose to 4.9 percent a day earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Another Bubble' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There are three main risks for the bonds, according to
            Richard Segal, London-based head of international credit
            strategy at Jeffries International Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields could rise if 'the U.S. Treasury (USGG10YR) market sells off
            sharply again' or if 'risk perceptions elsewhere in emerging
            markets settle down and flight to quality flows reverse,' he
            said by e-mail Feb. 20. Segal sees a third risk if 'investors
            begin to consider the possibility of another bubble in the
            United Arab Emirates,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, many feel equities are more expensive than fixed
            income, so this is less of a near-term risk, Segal said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growing liquidity is another factor acting in DP World and
            Jafza's favor, Nazim said, as investors seek a place to put
            their money. Sukuk sales from Dubai slowed this year, with $300
            million raised compared with $750 million in the year-earlier
            period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Islamic bond sales in the emirate are expected to increase
            as Dubai invests more than $8 billion preparing to host the
            World Expo in 2020 and as $30 billion of debt comes due this
            year. The sheikhdom, one of seven that make up the U.A.E., has a
            stated ambition to become capital of the world's Islamic economy
            within three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai expects economic growth to average 4.6 percent,
            between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the pace as in the prior
            four years. Amid the growth, property prices and trade are
            soaring, helping Emaar, the operator of the world's largest
            mall, to regain the investment grade rating lost in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Upgrades will ensure that 'regional investors will get
            more comfortable,' Nazim said. 'You don't need too many to
            push the bonds tighter.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Profit Up 50% in Five Years Amid Job Cuts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said the bank
            can increase profit 50 percent in the next four to five years as
            higher rates boost interest margins and the firm cuts 5,500 more
            jobs from retail units than it had forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Profit can reach $27 billion if legal costs subside and
            income from loans and investments improves, the New York-based
            company said today in a slide presentation for its annual
            investor day. The bank now plans to eliminate about 8,000 jobs
            in consumer and mortgage banking this year as demand wanes for
            refinancings. Hiring in areas such as compliance and risk
            management will offset some of the cuts, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Managers led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon are
            laying out strategy at the biggest U.S. bank by assets after a
            year marred by clashes with regulators and $23 billion in legal
            costs. Dimon, 57, is seeking to accelerate growth and trim
            unwanted units while fending off allegations that the firm
            misled buyers of mortgage bonds, rigged markets and ignored
            suspicious activity by clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We now have clarity on most of the regulatory rules, and
            we believe that we, more than others, will successfully adapt to
            the new financial architecture and will emerge where we started
            -- with best-in-class margins and returns,' Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake said at the investor conference. &lt;/p&gt;

            JPMorgan Chase Co. said it expects $3.5 billion of net income by 2017 from expansions in businesses
            including middle-market lending and private banking. Close

        <headline>JPMorgan Compliance Chief Armine Leaves Post After a Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the lender
            whose legal and regulatory battles led to more than $23 billion
            in settlements in 2013, said Chief Compliance Officer Cindy Armine left to join another firm after a year on
            the job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lou Rauchenberger, the chief administrative officer of the
            corporate and investment bank, was named as interim replacement,
            according to a staff memo from Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The departure was reported earlier today by the Wall Street
            Journal, which said Armine is moving to First Data Corp., the
            payment processor run by former JPMorgan executive Frank Bisignano. He left JPMorgan last year when Chief
            Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon named Zames sole chief operating officer at
            the bank. Bisignano hired JPMorgan's former Chief Information
            Officer Guy Chiarello as president last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has clashed with regulators and law enforcement
            officials over accusations that it misled buyers of mortgage
            bonds, rigged markets and overlooked suspicious activity by
            clients. The company agreed last month to pay $2.6 billion to
            settle allegations that it ignored signs of wrongdoing in
            Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As Jamie and our leadership team have said, controls and
            compliance are our most important priority,' Zames wrote. 'We
            have made great progress over the past few years on our controls
            agenda, and we will continue to focus on it relentlessly.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Managers will seek to 'ensure a fortress compliance and
            control environment,' according to a slide show today at an
            annual presentation for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Armine joined the firm in May 2011 as chief control officer
            of home lending after 31 years at Citigroup Inc., where she was
            chief compliance officer. She was promoted to JPMorgan's head of
            compliance in January 2013. Attempts to reach Armine for comment
            weren't immediately successful. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mayo Asks Erdoes How It Feels at Unit Trapped at JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mike Mayo, the analyst who sparred
            at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s 2013 investor day with Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon, challenged the bank at today's event about
            the logic of holding an asset-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., asked Mary Erdoes, CEO of
            JPMorgan's asset manager, how it feels to be 'trapped' in a
            bank that he estimates is valued at about 40 percent less than
            companies in her business, based on price-to-earnings ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You would probably be worth a lot more as a standalone,'
            Mayo said. 'How does it feel to be a 17 P-E business trapped in
            a 10 P-E company?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon has said clients benefit from the array of services
            provided by his New York-based company. JPMorgan is the largest
            U.S. bank, and today's session featured presentations by
            commercial, retail and investment bankers, along with Erdoes,
            who oversees more than $2 trillion. She said her unit helps
            JPMorgan meet 'holistic needs' of customers, and that the
            valuation hasn't hurt compensation of top money managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We work very hard to deliver the whole company to the
            clients,' Erdoes said today. 'Someday we believe that all the
            value of this part of the business will be reflected in the
            stock price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has advanced 20 percent in the past 12 months,
            beating the 14 percent gain of T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW), while
            trailing BlackRock Inc. (BLK)'s 27 percent rally. JPMorgan trades for
            about 8.6 times reported earnings, less than half the ratio at
            BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The stock has done fine as a competitive matter, against
            most major competitors,' Dimon told Mayo today. 'More than
            fine, which you've noted yourself in some of your analyst
            reports.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July 2012, Mayo said Morgan Stanley (MS) would be worth as
            much as $32 if the firm were broken up. The bank, which didn't
            heed his call, has since more than doubled to $29.71 at 4 p.m.
            in New York. The gain was fueled by improved profitability at
            its brokerage unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mayo asked Dimon at last year's gathering if clients might
            shift to banks with the highest capital ratios, citing UBS AG as
            one company that could seek to win business from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon countered, 'so you would go to UBS' rather than
            JPMorgan? 'I didn't say that,' Mayo responded. 'I said that
            was their argument.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's why I'm richer than you,' Dimon said, drawing
            laughter from the audience. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan Move of 2,000 Workers to Brooklyn</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender, is moving about 2,000 employees to offices in
            Brooklyn's MetroTech Center after a review of its real estate holdings, said a person with direct knowledge
            of the plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest single source of employees heading to Brooklyn by year-end is 1
            Chase Manhattan Plaza, the 60-story lower Manhattan skyscraper the bank sold to Shanghai-based Fosun
            International Ltd. (656) in 2013, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the move isn't
            public. The employees are from several of the bank's business lines, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            is consolidating its real estate as it pushes to trim expenses and simplify itself by exiting businesses
            including student lending and private equity. Offices in and near downtown Brooklyn, where MetroTech Center
            is located, are among the most in demand in the city, in particular drawing young technology and
            social-media companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan follows through with its plans, it will show that
            the market also can appeal to traditional financial firms while it tries to attract and retain young talent,
            said Tucker Reed, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a group representing local businesses.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Were they to come, it would be a validation of our office market here,' Reed said in a
            telephone interview. 'The only drawback, if you can call it that, would be the challenge it creates. It
            means there would be even less office space for us to grow into. It makes our space dilemma a little more
            acute, but that's a good problem to have.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tightest Market &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooklyn's
            15.5 million square feet (1.4 million square meters) of offices are more than 96 percent occupied, data from
            CBRE Group Inc. show. By comparison, Manhattan's tightest office market -- the area roughly from 30th to
            Canal streets, known as midtown south -- has a 93 percent occupancy rate, according to the real estate
            services firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MetroTech Center is a 3.7 million-square-foot office campus close to the
            Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. JPMorgan owns two buildings at the complex. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another
            group of Chase Plaza-based staff members is bound for the bank's offices at the Newport office complex on
            Washington Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, the person said. The transfers started in December and will
            continue throughout 2014, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender intends to keep about
            300,000 to 400,000 square feet of offices at Chase Plaza, the person said. JPMorgan occupied about half the
            space in the 2.2 million-square-foot tower, according to data from CoStar Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're
            continually looking at ways to ensure that our space and occupancy strategy aligns with the ever-evolving
            needs of our business,' Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MetroTech
            Space &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As recently as 2012, JPMorgan considered giving up at least some of its offices
            at MetroTech, listing about 700,000 square feet for rent, according to the person. After floods from
            Hurricane Sandy damaged bank offices at 4 New York Plaza, another downtown Manhattan tower, displaced
            workers were moved temporarily into the Brooklyn space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan owns 4 MetroTech
            Center, with about 1.35 million square feet, and 3 MetroTech Center, according to Mrofficespace.com, a
            website that tracks New York office buildings. The other six buildings at the office park are owned by
            Forest City Ratner Cos., which started building MetroTech in the late 1980s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 16-acre
            (6.5-hectare) campus was Brooklyn's first modern office development, built in partnership with the New York
            City government. Many of its earlier tenants have been financial firms, including Bank of New York and Bear
            Stearns Cos., which used the properties for back-office operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the
            complex has attracted technology and media companies such as MakerBot Industries LLC, a developer of
            three-dimensional printers; and ImpreMedia LLC, which publishes Hispanic newspapers including New York's El
            Diario La Prensa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Downtown Brooklyn has now become a very diverse ecosystem of varied
            companies that are more reflective of all of Brooklyn and all of New York City,' said Ali Esmaeilzadeh, vice
            president of commercial development and leasing at Forest City Ratner. 'There's still the presence of
            government and back-office, there's also a surge in technology-based firms, entrepreneurial-type companies.'

        <headline>JPMorgan Adopts Pew Disclosure Form for Prepaid Card Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, adopted a new disclosure form for its
            prepaid card to provide greater clarity on fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The disclosure, based on a model released by Pew Charitable
            Trusts, gives customers a description of fees and when deposits
            are available in an easy-to-read format, the New York-based bank
            said today in a statement. Pew is a Washington-based non-profit
            research firm specializing in trends and public attitudes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Government agencies including the Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau are pushing financial firms to make their
            retail products easier to understand. The amount loaded onto
            prepaid cards by U.S. consumers more than doubled in 2012 to $64
            billion from 2009, according to Pew's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This disclosure box should be required by the Consumer
            Financial Protection Bureau for all general purpose reloadable
            prepaid cards,' Susan Weinstock, director of Pew's safe
            checking research, said on the trust's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samuel Gilford, spokesman for the Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau, didn't immediately respond to inquiries about
            the Pew standard. U.S. Senator Mark R. Warner, a Virginia
            Democrat on the Banking Committee, has introduced legislation
            requiring financial institutions to be more upfront with prepaid
            cards. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dimon Says Threats to JPMorgan Span Google to China Banks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, who built JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) into the world's biggest investment bank, said
            threats to its dominance may come from Beijing, Silicon Valley
            and a San Francisco-based rival with a stage-coach logo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We know there are going to be attacks everywhere,' Dimon
            told investors at an annual meeting yesterday at the firm's New
            York headquarters. Asked about challengers, the chief executive
            officer cited companies from Industrial Commercial Bank of
            China Ltd. (601398) to Google Inc. Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), founded in 1852 to
            serve California's Gold Rush pioneers, will be 'a major
            investment bank' within five years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, guided JPMorgan through the financial crisis
            without posting a quarterly loss and expanded the firm by
            acquiring rivals that faltered. As the company grappled with
            costs from government probes last year, its profit was surpassed
            by Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. lender, which relies
            most on retail banking and mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'My operating assumption has always been and always will
            be that we are going to have huge, tough competition from
            Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo to some new entrants,' Dimon
            said. 'Wells Fargo will be in our business. I have enormous
            respect for them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, led by CEO John Stumpf, 60, has been expanding
            its securities unit. The lender opened trading floors in 2012 in
            Charlotte, North Carolina, bolstering a securities business
            acquired with the purchase of Wachovia Corp. four years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'They're Huge' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICBC (1398), based in Beijing, is seeking to triple earnings from
            outside its home country by 2016. China's biggest financial
            firms are 'ambitious' and have 'strategic reason to win,'
            Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're huge, their clients are huge,' he said. 'I
            expect very large, tough Chinese competitors all around the
            world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan generated $26.6 billion of revenue from corporate
            advisory, underwriting and trading in 2013, the most of any
            global investment bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the major U.S. bank most reliant on
            trading, had $34.2 billion in total revenue, including other
            businesses such as asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California technology companies are delving into electronic
            payments. Google (GOOG), based in Mountain View, created Wallet, a
            program that lets users make transactions in stores and online
            with their smartphones. Cupertino-based Apple Inc., which has
            more than 400 million credit cards on file with its iTunes
            Store, is exploring an expansion of its mobile-payments system,
            a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EBay's PayPal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EBay Inc.'s PayPal unit is a leading online payments
            system, which accounts for 40 percent of the San Jose-based
            company's revenue and has 143 million active users. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology companies 'all want to eat our lunch,' Dimon
            said. 'I mean every single one of them, and they're going to
            try.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon may be overstating his firm's vulnerability to blunt
            criticism of its size, said Erik Gordon, a business professor at
            the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. JPMorgan is the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets and the country's largest credit-card
            lender. It counts 80 percent of the Fortune 500 as clients,
            according to presentations at yesterday's meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He's downplaying the fact that at the end of the day,
            JPMorgan is probably as powerful as any financial institution,
            including going back to the original JPMorgan,' Gordon said in
            a telephone interview. 'It's his way of saying, 'Don't be
            afraid of us and how big we are.' My guess is that he doesn't
            really go home at night and worry about Wells Fargo.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cutting Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon's comments on long-term threats came near the end of
            his company's annual investor meeting. The bank can increase
            profit by 50 percent to $27 billion in four to five years as
            higher rates boost interest margins and legal costs subside,
            according to presentations posted yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also said it would eliminate about 8,000 jobs in
            consumer and mortgage banking this year, while hiring in areas
            such as compliance and risk management. Dimon said he will stick
            with home lending, after calling mortgages 'the most painful
            business ever.' The loans fill a key need for consumers, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan slipped 0.6 percent to $56.67 at 9:44 a.m. in New
            York after dropping 1.7 percent yesterday. It has gained 19
            percent in the past 12 months, trailing the 24 percent advance
            of the Standard Poor's 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading revenue dropped about 15 percent so far this year
            compared with the same period in 2013, Dimon said yesterday.
            Lower levels of client activity, especially in fixed income,
            pressured results, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Dog Days' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's earnings last year were marred by clashes with
            regulators and $23 billion in legal settlements that contributed
            to the bank's first quarterly loss under Dimon. The CEO is
            selling or closing businesses he considers risky and dropping
            non-U.S. clients who may invite regulatory scrutiny. He's
            fending off allegations the firm rigged markets and ignored
            suspicious activity by clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday's meeting concluded on an upbeat note, with a
            song from English rock band Florence + the Machine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The dog days are over,' the lyrics blared from speakers.
            'The dog days are done.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan $300 Million Accord Over Kickback Claim Approved</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A $300 million settlement by
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and insurers with homeowners who accused
            the bank of taking kickbacks in exchange for sticking them with
            overpriced insurance policies was approved by a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno in Miami today approved
            the accord. It requires JPMorgan, Assurant Inc. (AIZ) and other
            insurers to pay refunds valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium
            costs to homeowners who had certain policies placed on their
            properties by the bank starting in January 2008. JPMorgan and
            Assurant didn't admit wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The homeowners sued New York-based JPMorgan last year,
            claiming the bank placed required hazard and wind coverage with
            Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates. Some of the
            excess costs were kicked back to a JPMorgan unit, the homeowners
            alleged in their class-action, or group, lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among several large banks facing claims by
            homeowners that they overcharged mortgage borrowers for lender-placed insurance. Last year, New York-based
            Assurant agreed to
            pay $14 million to resolve similar allegations by the New York
            State Department of Financial Services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his ruling, Moreno rejected objections to the settlement
            and approved $20 million in fees to lawyers for the class. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Saccoccio v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 13-cv-21107, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of Florida
            (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wall Street Hates JPMorgan Fee for $1 Trillion Junk Loans</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;On Wall Street, $3,500 goes further than anyone dared imagine in the 1980s when the predecessor to
            JPMorgan Chase Co. charged the fee to trade each non-investment grade loan it sold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
            surcharge remains the same today and helps the biggest U.S. bank dominate the secretive $1.1 trillion
            junk-loan market while stifling profits for investors and rivals, which mostly stopped charging it years
            ago. The New York-based bank waives it for exclusive customers: trade with JPMorgan, no fee; trade one of
            its loans with anyone else, pay up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan can dictate terms because of its size,
            according to 12 people with knowledge of the matter who are concerned they'd jeopardize their business if
            their identities were revealed. The bank brings more corporate debt to market than anyone, and competitors
            and investors say they might be shut out of future deals if they don't play by JPMorgan's rules. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'This is one of the last frontiers of relatively unregulated, over-the-counter trading between
            financial giants,' said Jose Gabilondo, a law professor at Florida International University in Miami who
            focuses on corporate finance. 'You're dealing with a market that doesn't have regulated disclosure
            requirements getting the information out in the market.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Riskier Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The issue goes beyond pinched profits for rivals and investors such as pension plans and hedge
            funds that buy the loans. It's also about what may happen when riskier investments lose their appeal. Since
            the fees make it unprofitable for JPMorgan competitors to trade loans made by the bank, buying and selling
            the debt may become difficult and put at risk individual investors, who own more of the loans through mutual
            funds than ever before. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, declined to
            comment on the bank's practice of charging the trading fees or the way in which the charge affects how
            quickly investors can move in and out of the market. The bank has more than 1,200 predecessor institutions,
            according to its website, and became JPMorgan Chase in 2000 after J.P. Morgan Co. merged with Chase
            Manhattan Corp., which had earlier combined with Chemical Banking Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is at
            the center of an unprecedented expansion in global corporate debt markets, which have become more popular
            with investors seeking alternatives to government securities as central banks hold interest rates at record
            lows to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Underwriter &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The market value of bonds
            in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate High Yield Index has soared to $10.5 trillion from
            $5.15 trillion in 2008. The market for institutional junk-rated loans, given to the most indebted companies,
            increased to $688.3 billion last year, exceeding the 2007 peak of $596 billion, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan was the biggest
            underwriter of corporate bonds last year, with a 6.8 percent share of the $3.27 trillion issued, compared
            with 6.1 percent for No. 2 Bank of America Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was also the
            top-ranked manager of U.S. syndicated loan sales, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2007, JPMorgan's
            assets have grown 55 percent and its customer deposits have risen 74 percent. The bank ranks first in the
            U.S. in both categories. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Junk loans, also called high-yield or leveraged loans, are a
            lucrative business for banks at a time when new regulations designed to make the financial system safer are
            forcing them to cut back on businesses such as trading for their own accounts. Banks have typically earned 1
            percent to 5 percent selling pieces of the debt to institutional investors such as pension plans and mutual
            funds, according to Standard Poor's data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Banking Behemoth &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
            compares with almost nothing to manage sales of investment-grade loans, given to companies with good credit,
            and an average 1.3 percent on sales of junk bonds last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Banks also
            earn an annual fee from borrowers to handle the paperwork, making sure everyone gets paid what they're owed.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $3,500 add-on might seem like a mote of dust on the $2.4 trillion balance sheet of a
            banking behemoth such as JPMorgan. Still, the fees add up because trades often consist of multiple
            transactions and JPMorgan charges for each. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, if an investment firm buys a $2
            million slice of a loan administered by JPMorgan and then parcels it out to four of its funds, it would be
            forced to pay $14,000 if a dealer other than JPMorgan brokers the trade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Additional
            Inefficiencies' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a nuisance and it creates additional inefficiencies,' David
            Breazzano, the president and chief investment officer of Waltham, Massachusetts-based DDJ Capital Management
            LLC, said in an interview. DDJ manages more than $7 billion in high-yield assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rivals
            said they're reluctant to trade many deals that JPMorgan helped to originally distribute because it's too
            costly. Rather than finding ways to circumvent the biggest U.S. bank, investors usually give in and trade
            the debt only with JPMorgan, said the people who requested anonymity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rivals said
            they're also concerned that if they don't comply, JPMorgan may not give them opportunities to buy new deals
            the bank brings to market. That would hurt their business because their customers are giving them more cash
            to invest in high-yield loans than ever before, the people said. Perras, the JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The loans are widely traded. Last year's $517 billion of transactions were
            within $3 billion of the all-time high in 2007, SP and Loan Syndications and Trading Association data show.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Financial Burden &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More plentiful trading has 'dramatically
            increased the financial burden that assignment fees have imposed,' said Barry Zamore, the head of U.S.
            non-distressed, leveraged-loan trading for Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. 'Assignment fees were meant
            for the manual processes in the year 1995, not 2014.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the 2008 financial crisis,
            international rules penalized financial institutions for keeping the loans on their books by requiring them
            to hold more capital in case the debt goes bad. Banks found ready buyers in an economy distorted by the
            Federal Reserve's near-zero benchmark interest rate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans have returned 81
            percent in the past five years through January, about five times the 16.6 percent return of the Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Junk loans differ from junk bonds even though
            many investors buy both. Finance laws drafted after the Great Depression of the 1930s didn't consider junk
            loans to be securities because they were mostly private transactions between one bank and one borrower.
            Since the government already supervised banks, lawmakers saw no need to double up by regulating their loans,
            too. Today, banks sell most of the loans to institutions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Relative Darkness &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's impossible to estimate from public regulatory filings how much JPMorgan earns from the fees.
            Trading data isn't available on a loan-specific level. Banks don't disclose such detailed earnings, nor are
            they legally required to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lack of transparency allows the trading of leveraged loans
            to go on in relative darkness, said Elisabeth de Fontenay, a Duke Law School professor in Durham, North
            Carolina, who previously worked as a corporate lawyer at Ropes Gray LLP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            leveraged-loan market is at once the most dynamic and the least visible capital market in the U.S., which is
            exactly how its participants like it,' de Fontenay said in an academic article presented at the 2013 Law and
            Society Association conference. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn't
            tried to regulate the loans as securities, such oversight would lead to pressure to lower or eliminate fees,
            de Fontenay said in a telephone interview this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lotus Spreadsheets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market will be tested when sentiment deteriorates, she said. It's happened before. Prices fell
            as low as 59.2 cents on the dollar during the 2008 credit crisis, SP and LSTA data show. They hit a high of
            98.9 cents on Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's fee is a relic from a time when clerks used Lotus
            spreadsheets to track transactions and the market for junk loans was less than 2 percent the size it is now.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loan trades can still take weeks to settle, and until 2012 traders relied on fax
            machines to place orders. In contrast, junk bonds are increasingly traded electronically and have prices
            that are publicly reported through Trace, run by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's dominance dates from 1982, when banker James B. Lee Jr. created a loan syndication unit
            to sell pieces of debt for JPMorgan predecessor Chemical Bank, according to a press release for a New York
            Public Library event honoring Lee in 2008. Lee is now a JPMorgan vice chairman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stopped
            Charging &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 1999, another JPMorgan predecessor, Chase Manhattan, handled 44 percent of
            the $22 billion of loans to the least creditworthy companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, JPMorgan managed the distribution of $133.7 billion of junk-rated loans, the
            second-biggest share among banks. Bank of America has been the top underwriter since 2008 after combining
            with Merrill Lynch Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America charges the $3,500 fee to JPMorgan, Royal Bank of
            Canada and Jefferies Group LLC, according to two people familiar with the trades. The Charlotte, North
            Carolina-based bank waives the fee for most of its rivals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2005, Credit Suisse,
            Deutsche Bank AG, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and 10 other
            banks agreed to mostly stop charging each other's clients the standard $3,500 fee to trade loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Impediment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors are still protesting 10 years after an August
            2004 LSTA survey in which market participants said the surcharges are 'an impediment for the loan market.'
            The fee reduced competition, making it cost more to enter and exit the growing market, investors said at the
            time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'These fees are associated with froth,' said Gabilondo of Florida International
            University. 'The bank probably feels that it can skim a little bit off because there's some investor on the
            other side who's so willing to hold these that they're willing to pay a transaction fee.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mutual
            funds, whose investors are often quick to buy and sell, account for about 33 percent of the market,
            according to data from SP and the LSTA. They channeled a record $63 billion into the debt last year,
            compared with net withdrawals in 2007. Retirees and pensioners are turning to leveraged loans, which pay
            more when benchmark interest rates rise, instead of junk bonds, which are tied to fixed benchmark rates.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yields on junk loans issued this year are an average 5.03 percent, according to SP's
            Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary Data. That compares with the yield on 10-year Treasury bond of 2.64 percent.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a surprisingly concentrated market,' said de Fontenay of Duke Law School. 'Right
            now there's so much artificial demand for loans. In the long run it will be an issue.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SodaStream Surge Extending to JPMorgan on U.S.: Israel Overnight</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA), the
            Israeli maker of soda machines trading at the most expensive
            level since February, will extend last year's 37 percent climb
            as its U.S. business grows, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company, based in Airport City, Israel,
            climbed 12 percent last week in New York to $48.69, the highest
            level since Aug. 15, 2011. It was the biggest gainer on the
            Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN) of the largest U.S.-traded
            Israeli companies, which rallied 1.6 percent in its first weekly
            advance since November. Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) rose 3.2
            percent Jan. 4, trimming its slide in the week to 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SodaStream, which sells its machines, gas canisters and
            flavors in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), trades at 18.3 times estimated
            earnings, the highest level since Feb. 29. The U.S. will
            contribute 39 percent of SodaStream's sales this year, according
            to JPMorgan, from 29 percent in 2011. The company will post a 44
            percent jump in adjusted net income in the first quarter, the
            median of analysts' estimates shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As the top line continues to grow, and more U.S. revenue
            switches to canisters and flavors, the profitability in the U.S.
            business will improve,' John Faucher, an analyst at JPMorgan
            who rates SodaStream a buy, said by phone in New York Jan. 4.
            'That's a trend that benefits SodaStream.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index ended last week at
            86.78. Israel's TA-25 Index (TA-25) rose 0.7 percent to 1,218.84 at
            10:57 a.m. in Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Income &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SodaStream, which is counting on a commercial during next
            month's Super Bowl to boost U.S. sales, will post net income in
            the first quarter of $14.6 million, according to the average of
            four analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in the
            first quarter will rise 23 percent, according to the average of
            five forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock is trading at its widest premium versus the
            average valuation for companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index
            since at least February, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SodaStream began to roll out its products in May at 2,900
            stores owned by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, while
            its machines have also been available since at least the second
            quarter at Target Corp., Staples Inc. and Bed Bath Beyond
            Inc., as well as department stores owned by J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) and
            Macy's Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As the shares have soared, bets on its decline have
            decreased. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SodaStream's 9.6 percent rally in the second half of 2012
            came as short interest on the stock declined to 8.1 million
            shares, or 45 percent of the company's float, at the end of
            December from 10.8 million shares in May, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fad Concerns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have been shorting SodaStream on concern the
            product, which carbonates tap water, is a fad and that revenue
            growth will slow as copycat machines and products encroach on
            market share, Faucher said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mellanox plunged last week in the U.S. to $52.31, after the
            Yokneam Elit, Israel-based developer of data management
            technology cut its fourth-quarter sales forecast to between $119
            million and $121 million, compared with revenue guidance given
            in October of $145 million to $150 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company rose Jan. 4 after Chief Executive
            Officer Eyal Waldman said in an interview after markets closed
            the day before that he expects $150 million in quarterly sales
            to again become the 'base line sometime in 2013.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mellanox's revenue in the third quarter reached a record
            $156.5 million. The shares in Tel Aviv rose 3.7 percent to
            197.4, or the equivalent of $52.32, this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT), which develops products to track
            wireless traffic, tumbled 16 percent last week to $14.63 in New
            York after Oppenheimer Co. said fourth-quarter sales will miss
            analysts' estimates. Shares of Hod Hasharon, Israel-based Allot
            traded in Tel Aviv lost 8.7 percent this morning to 55.69
            shekels, or the equivalent of $14.76, heading for the lowest
            close since November 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ittai Kidron, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer,
            wrote in a Jan. 3 report that Allot will report fourth-quarter
            sales of $28.6 million and net income of $5 million, missing the
            mean for revenue of $31.09 million and profit of $5.5 million of
            11 analysts' estimates collated by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says New York Filed Bear Stearns Suit Too Late</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;New York's fraud lawsuit against
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) over mortgage securities sold to investors
            must be dismissed because the time for bringing the claims has
            expired, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's complaint is
            barred by a three-year statute of limitations, JPMorgan said in
            papers dated Jan. 4 and filed in New York State Supreme Court in
            Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schneiderman sued New York-based JPMorgan in October,
            alleging that Bear Stearns, the investment bank it acquired in
            2008, deceived investors about mortgage loans backing
            securities, leading to losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schneiderman, who was named co-chairman of a state-federal
            group formed to investigate misconduct in the bundling of
            mortgage loans into securities, has said the JPMorgan case would
            serve as a template for lawsuits against other issuers. The
            state has also sued Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) on similar grounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York's claims stem from Bear Stearns' role as sponsor
            and underwriter of subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities
            before JPMorgan acquired the securities firm. Losses on $87
            billion of securities from 2006 and 2007 total about $22.5
            billion, according to the state's complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Will Prevail' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are confident that our office will prevail, and that
            those responsible for the misconduct that led to the crash of
            the housing market and the collapse of the American economy will
            be held accountable,' James Freedland, a spokesman for
            Schneiderman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is among 10 mortgage servicers that reached an
            $8.5 billion settlement that will end reviews of foreclosure-
            abuse claims, regulators said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender argued in its court filing that New York can't
            take advantage of a six-year statute of limitations and that a
            three-year period applies. JPMorgan and the state reached a
            so-called tolling agreement effective April 5, 2012, that
            stopped the statute of limitations from expiring, according to
            the filing. Because the conduct at issue occurred before April
            2009, the claims must be dismissed, JPMorgan argued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The attorney general's office contends a six-year period
            applies under the state's securities fraud statute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also said in its court filing that the case should
            be dismissed because the state hasn't outlined its allegations
            with the 'requisite particularity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Even if the attorney general's claims were not time-
            barred, they would fail for lack of specificity and must
            therefore be dismissed,' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is People of the State of New York v. J.P. Morgan
            Securities, 451556-2012, New York State Supreme Court
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seeks Liability Shield in WaMu Bondholder Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) asked a federal
            judge to order the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to cover any
            costs or liabilities in a bondholder case stemming from the
            bank's takeover of Washington Mutual Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in a filing today in Washington, said that under
            the terms of a 2008 agreement with the FDIC it shouldn't be on
            the hook for any damages, attorneys' fees or court costs in a
            lawsuit filed by Washington Mutual bondholders accusing the bank
            of being involved in a scheme to deprive them of their
            investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When it picked up Washington Mutual banking operations in
            September 2008, JPMorgan 'assumed only certain defined
            liabilities,' which didn't include WaMu's bond obligations,
            according to the filing. WaMu's debt obligations -- including
            the bonds at issue in the case -- were liabilities that remained
            with the FDIC, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a result of this action, the JPMC defendants have
            suffered significant harm,' attorney Brent McIntosh of Sullivan
            Cromwell LLP wrote in the filing, referring to the suit. New
            York-based JPMorgan has 'been forced to litigate this action
            for close to four years and incurred substantial costs and
            expenses,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A federal judge dismissed the suit in 2010 after finding
            that the bondholders hadn't sought recovery through the FDIC's
            administrative claims process. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Case Revived &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case was revived on appeal in 2011 by a three-judge
            panel, which ruled that the court had jurisdiction because the
            bondholders' allegations of wrongdoing were made against
            JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If JPMorgan thinks the FDIC is responsible for the
            damages my client suffered, that is between them,' Andrew J.
            Mytelka, a lawyer for the bondholders, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Barr, an FDIC spokesman, said the agency doesn't
            comment on active litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is American National Insurance Co. v. Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corp., 09-cv-01743, U.S. District Court,
            District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Imax Gains as 'Hobbit' Boosts JPMorgan Forecast</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Imax Corp. (IMAX) rose to its highest price
            in more than five months after JPMorgan Chase Co. boosted its
            sales and profit forecasts on higher-than-expected audience
            turnout for 3-D films such as 'The Hobbit.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Imax gained 5.4 percent in Toronto to C$23.75, the highest
            price since July 25. It was also the biggest gain since Oct. 11
            for the Mississauga, Ontario-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Hobbit,' a prequel to Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the
            Rings' saga, grossed $46 million for Imax in December and
            continues to perform well in January, said Townsend Buckles, a
            JPMorgan analyst in New York, in a research note dated today. He
            raised his expectations for Imax's fourth-quarter box office
            receipts to $146 million from $130 million and for adjusted
            earnings to 18 cents a share from 17 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Imax experience continues to be very engaging for
            theatergoers,' said Paul Sweeney, a media analyst with
            Bloomberg Industries, in a telephone interview from Skillman,
            New Jersey. 'Although the outlook for 3-D films may have
            sobered up in 2012, Imax remains very robust.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to Sweeney, 3-D now accounts for about 45 percent
            to 50 percent of a given film's box-office receipts, less than
            industry analysts had expected since the technology regained
            popularity with James Cameron's 2009 blockbuster 'Avatar.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Imax has placed its theaters in city areas with
            demographics that can afford the premium price, as well as
            expansion into developing markets, especially Brazil, Sweeney
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Strong Profits &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Imax's growth in emerging markets and its slate of
            blockbuster movies will make profits 'strong' this year and
            next, Buckles said in his note. He didn't immediately return a
            phone message. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The film industry's box-office growth in 2012 is expected
            to continue this year, Sweeney said. Domestic box-office
            receipts rose 6.1 percent in 2012 to $10.8 billion, the first
            year-over-year increase since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Imax Chief Executive Officer Richard Gelfond wasn't
            immediately available for an interview, said Whit Clay, a
            company spokesman who works for Sloane Co. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Vatican ATMs Down, Circuit Breakers, JPMorgan: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A suspension of electronic payments
            in Vatican City is threatening finances in the world's smallest
            state as pilgrims and tourists are forced to use cash in museums
            and shops with yearly sales of more than $100 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit and debit card payments and cash withdrawals stayed
            suspended Jan. 4 in the papal state for a fourth day after the
            Bank of Italy refused a request to keep providing the services
            by the operator, Deutsche Bank AG's Italian unit. The central
            bank acted because the Vatican doesn't comply with international
            money-laundering rules, a Bank of Italy official said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The interruption to electronic payment services will be
            'brief,' the Vatican said in a statement Jan. 3. The papal
            state, home to Pope Benedict XVI, is in central Rome near the
            Tiber river. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cash withdrawals from machines operated by the Vatican bank
            IOR aren't affected, a Vatican spokesman, who declined to be
            named, said. Tourists will be able to buy tickets for the
            Vatican museums online until Jan. 15, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Rome-based central bank found in a 2010 inspection that
            the Deutsche Bank unit, which started operating the papal
            state's point-of-service payment services in 1997, didn't have
            the authorization to operate in the Vatican City, a Bank of
            Italy official said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank on Dec. 6 refused a permit request to
            Deutsche Bank SpA because the state lacks required banking and
            financial legislation, the official said. A Deutsche Bank
            spokeswoman for Italy declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vatican authorities are trying to find another bank
            provider, the Vatican press office said last week. A new
            operator may be announced today, the Financial Times reported
            Jan. 4, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Curbs to Prevent Stock Volatility May Be Delayed, Bats Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New curbs to limit rapid price moves in individual stocks
            and changes to rules designed to prevent market-wide routs may
            be delayed two months until April, according to exchange
            operator Bats Global Markets Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shift from circuit breakers that make trading pause if
            a stock rises or falls 10 percent in five minutes to curbs that
            limit moves without automatically triggering a halt will take
            effect April 8 instead of Feb. 4, subject to regulatory
            approval, the Lenexa, Kansas-based company said in a notice on
            its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Changes to an existing program that stops all equity-based
            trading across stocks, options and futures will also be delayed,
            Bats said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both measures are meant to protect investors from extreme
            price moves. The gauge that will trigger the marketwide circuit
            breakers is switching from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) to
            the Standard Poor's 500 Index, while the price drop for
            trading to stop is being narrowed and the length of pauses
            shortened in most cases. The so-called limit-up/limit-down plan,
            which prevents individual stocks from moving outside a rolling
            price band, will replace the automatic halts implemented after
            the flash crash on May 6, 2010, when the 30-stock Dow average
            briefly fell 9.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission must approve
            the request to delay implementation of the limit-up/limit-down
            plan by the 13 stock exchanges and Financial Industry Regulatory
            Authority, which oversees more than 4,300 brokers, for it to go
            into effect. A separate delay request would have to be submitted
            by securities exchanges and Finra for the market-wide circuit
            breakers, introduced after the October 1987 market crash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment.
            Also declining to comment were Keara Everdell, a spokeswoman for
            NYSE Euronext, Robert Madden of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) and Jim
            Gorman at Direct Edge Holdings LLC. Dow Jones reported the
            planned delay earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Vietnam Plans to Have Exchange-Traded Funds in Fourth Quarter &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vietnam plans to allow exchange-traded funds beginning
            around the fourth quarter of this year, Vu Bang, chairman of
            State Securities Commission, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The preparation to set up the funds will take nearly a
            year, Bang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator also proposes introducing covered warrants
            this year. The SSC outlined six measures to attract foreign
            investment and improve stock market liquidity, for proposal to
            the finance ministry, Bang said. He declined to elaborate,
            saying the information is currently confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rule Could Make Hedge Funds Fraud Informers, Reuters Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, a part
            of the Treasury, is working on rule that would require U.S.
            hedge funds to file reports telling authorities of any
            suspicious trading by employees and outside parties, Reuters
            reported, citing the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rule would require the hedge fund industry to monitor
            itself in way similar to banks, mutual funds, and brokerages.
            The proposal would cover white collar crime including money
            laundering and insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rule may be filed for public comment in the first half
            of year, a FinCEN spokesman, Steve Hudak, said, according to
            Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rule is expected to meet with opposition from the hedge
            fund industry over concerns with costs and invasiveness, Reuters
            reported. A spokesman for the Managed Funds Association, the
            biggest hedge fund trade organization, didn't respond to a
            request for comment, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Faces Sanction for Refusing to Provide Madoff Documents &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department's inspector general threatened
            to punish JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) for failing to turn over
            documents to regulators investigating the bank's ties to the
            Ponzi scheme of convicted con man Bernard L. Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inspector General Eric Thorson gave the largest U.S. bank a
            Jan. 11 deadline to cooperate with the Office of the Comptroller
            of the Currency probe or risk sanctions for impeding the
            agency's oversight. JPMorgan, according to the Dec. 21 letter,
            says the information is protected by attorney-client privilege. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thorson's letter didn't spell out what documents the OCC is
            seeking or the focus of its investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The previously undisclosed OCC probe adds to the lender's
            troubles in Washington, where several agencies and lawmakers are
            investigating the bank's loss of at least $6.2 billion on
            botched derivatives trades. The losses have prompted regulators
            including the Federal Reserve to consider tightening proposed
            restrictions on proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said the bank
            'will of course continue to work together with our regulators'
            on the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This dispute does not go to the merits of the matter but
            it does raise an important issue of principle: Whether we and
            other banks, large and small alike, have the fundamental right
            long recognized in this country to communicate freely with and
            seek confidential guidance from their lawyers,' Zuccarelli said
            in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to comment on the
            agency's Madoff inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the letter to JPMorgan general counsel Stephen Cutler,
            the inspector general -- the Treasury's internal watchdog --
            dismissed JPMorgan's arguments on attorney-client privilege,
            saying the OCC 'could not do its work' if banks were allowed
            to withhold information on that basis. The OCC asked the IG
            office to review the situation, Thorson said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Congress Probes SEC Spending on Booz Allen, Reuters Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has until Jan.
            17 to turn over documents showing payments to consulting firm
            Booz Allen Hamilton, Reuters reported, citing a Jan. 3 letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The letter, sent to SEC Chairman Elisse Walter by House
            Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican from California,
            comes as part of a probe of agency spending on Booz Allen,
            Reuters reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC spent more than $8.5 million on consultants to
            advise on reforming workflow and back-office operations, Reuters
            reported last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Booz Allen didn't respond to a request for comment on the
            letter, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Weavering Founder Appears in Court Over Hedge Fund's Collapse &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd. founding director Magnus
            Peterson appeared in a London court today facing six charges of
            fraud, forgery, fraudulent trading and false accounting over the
            collapse of the hedge fund in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judge Michael Snow ordered Peterson, 49, to appear at a
            higher criminal court in 12 weeks and surrender his passport.
            The defunct fund had about $640 million under management in late
            2008 before discovering the counterparty for its biggest trading
            position was controlled by the fund's manager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office dropped their
            initial criminal probe into Peterson over concerns it wouldn't
            win a conviction. The SFO reopened the case in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hedge fund's administrators won a lawsuit to recover
            $450 million from Peterson and other former employees in May. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Rosenthal, a partner at Anchin, Block Anchin LLP,
            discussed an increase in the regulation of hedge funds.
            Rosenthal talked with Bloomberg's Pimm Fox and Vonnie Quinn on

            &lt;h2&gt;Geithner Said to Plan to Depart Before Debt-Ceiling Debate Ends &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has indicated to
            White House officials he wants to carry through with his plan to
            leave the administration by the end of this month even if debt-
            limit negotiations aren't concluded, according to two people
            familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Geithner contemplated leaving the position June 2011 while
            the debt ceiling was being debated, and President Barack Obama
            persuaded him to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His departure now would increase pressure on the president
            to name his successor at Treasury. White House Chief of Staff
            Jack Lew remains the leading contender, according to the people,
            who requested anonymity to discuss the private talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Geithner, 51, is the only remaining member of Obama's
            original economic team and was a key figure in the taxpayer-
            funded bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis. He's also had
            a principal role in negotiations with Congress on the budget
            deal and in past deliberations over the debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Because Lew has spent most of his career in government,
            Obama may seek to name a Wall Street executive as deputy
            Treasury secretary, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mailbox Bombing Probed at U.S. Treasury Inspector General's Home &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are investigating the bombing last week of
            a mailbox at the home of the Treasury Department's inspector
            general. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fairfax County, Virginia, police officers were called to
            Inspector General Eric Thorson's home in suburban Washington on
            Dec. 31 after he discovered his mailbox destroyed from what
            appeared to be a pipe bomb. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The matter is under investigation by the Fairfax County
            police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
            Explosives, according to Rich Delmar, counsel to the inspector
            general. Investigators are trying to determine if the bombing is
            connected to the official's work, said a person familiar with
            the matter who asked to remain anonymous because the probe was
            in its early stages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thorson's office conducts independent audits of the
            department and investigates cases of waste, fraud and abuse of
            government resources. It handles some financially related
            criminal cases, such as thefts of checks issued by the Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hambrecht Won't Join BASF Supervisory Board This Year, FAS Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former BASF (BAS) Chief Executive Officer Juergen Hambrecht won't
            seek election before 2014 to the company's supervisory board,
            Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported, citing an
            interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate law rules would allow him to join the board in
            2013 after a mandatory two-year waiting period since departing
            from a management post, the FAS reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hambrecht said he will wait until the term of the current
            supervisory board expires next year, according to FAS. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. boosted legal
            reserves following accords tied to the collapse of Bernard
            Madoff's Ponzi scheme and said the cost of settlements reduced
            fourth-quarter net income by about $850 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank added about $400 million to litigation reserves in
            the 2013 fourth quarter on a pretax basis, the New York-based
            company said today in a regulatory filing. JPMorgan is the

        <headline>JPMorgan 'Failed Miserably' in Madoff Case, Bharara Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which agreed to
            pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations it
            facilitated Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, 'failed miserably'
            as a financial institution, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One reason, among others, that Madoff was able to get
            away with his crime for so long was that JPMorgan had an
            inadequate and inefficient anti-money-laundering program,'
            Bharara said at a press conference today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
            prosecution by entering into an accord with Bharara's office
            that acknowledged oversight lapses related to an account Madoff
            used to fund his fraud. The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion
            to settle the U.S. allegations, $350 million in a related case
            by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, plus
            $543 million to cover separate private claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The bank connected the dots when it came to its own
            profits, but not when it came to its own legal obligations,'
            Bharara said, adding that the bank was aware of Madoff's
            questionable transactions as early as 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank didn't file any suspicious activity
            reports required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Timeline Chart &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Bank Secrecy Act is a law that requires financial
            institutions to establish and maintain effective anti-money
            laundering compliance programs and to know their customer,'
            Bharara said. 'It is not a tip. It is not a suggestion. It is a
            legal requirement enforceable through criminal sanction. Today's
            charges have been filed because in this regard, JPMorgan as an
            institution failed and failed miserably.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the press conference, Bharara displayed a timeline chart
            with comments by JPMorgan employees who suspected Madoff's
            fraud, which ended when he was arrested in December 2008 and
            cost investors about $17 billion. Madoff is serving a 150-year
            federal prison sentence in North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan fund manager wrote in December 1998 that
            Madoff's returns are 'possibly too good to be true' and that
            there were 'too many red flags' for the bank to do business
            with Madoff, according to the timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In June 2007, a senior JPMorgan chief risk officer said
            'there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that
            his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme,'
            according to the exhibit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Probes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
            forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
            penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
            other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We recognize we could have done a better job pulling
            together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff
            from different parts of the bank over time,' Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in an
            e-mailed
            statement. 'We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee
            knowingly assisted Madoff's Ponzi scheme.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From late 1986 to the Madoff firm's collapse, the Ponzi
            scheme 'was conducted almost exclusively through a demand
            deposit account and other linked cash and brokerage accounts
            held at JPMorgan,' prosecutors said in a criminal information
            in Manhattan federal court. 'Virtually all client investments
            were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at
            JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and virtually all client 'redemptions'
            were paid from a linked disbursement account.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Vantage Point' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan, because of its vantage point as Madoff's
            banker, had plenty of reasons to be uniquely suspicious about
            him. Warning signs abounded,' Bharara said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The volume, movement and use of funds should have generated
            suspicions among JPMorgan employees, Bharara said. From 1986 to
            2008 'an astounding $150 billion' went in and out of Madoff's
            JPMorgan account. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2006, a derivatives trading desk in JPMorgan's London
            office offered products linked to Madoff's performance and
            invested its own money in Madoff's feeder funds, Bharara said.
            By October 2008, the bank was so concerned about Madoff's
            returns that it redeemed $275 million it had in the funds, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the mid-1990s, the bank learned Madoff and a client of
            JPMorgan's Private Bank were engaged in questionable banking
            processes known as 'round-trip transactions' that amounted to
            what Bharara said was a 'check-kiting scheme.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Closed Account &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These transactions were so questionable that another U.S.
            bank involved in the transactions filed a suspicious activity
            report and closed Madoff's account, Bharara said. JPMorgan
            allowed the transactions to continue for close to a decade, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It took until after the arrest of Madoff, one of the
            worst crooks this office has ever seen, for JPMorgan to alert
            authorities to what the world already knew,' George Venizelos,
            the FBI assistant director in charge, said in a statement today.
            'We all need to be invested in making our markets safer and
            more equitable. The FBI can't do it alone. Traders, compliance
            officers, analysts, bankers, and executives are the gatekeepers
            of the financial industry. We need their help protecting our
            markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara said today his office plans for 'every penny' of
            the $1.7 billion to go to 'help make Bernie Madoff's victims
            closer to whole.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $1.7 Billion For Madoff Scheme Role</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to pay
            $1.7 billion to settle U.S. claims that it facilitated Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, the largest in U.S.
            history, resolving
            yet another legal obstacle facing the embattled bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, entered
            into a deferred-prosecution agreement with Manhattan U.S.
            Attorney Preet Bharara, acknowledging oversight lapses related
            to an account Madoff used to fund his multibillion-dollar fraud.
            Separately, the bank agreed to pay $543 million to resolve
            private claims over losses tied to the scheme, according to a
            person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the 'largest ever bank
            forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
            penalty,' Bharara said today in a statement. JPMorgan, led by
            Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay
            $15.7 billion to resolve other U.S. regulatory probes into
            practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank still faces criminal inquiries into its energy
            trading practices, which were subject to a $410 million civil
            settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in
            July. Along with other banks, the firm also faces a probe into
            the possible manipulation of interest rates and currency
            benchmarks in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Exponent Said to Name JPMorgan for Refinancing HSS</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Exponent Private Equity LLP, a
            London-based private-equity firm, hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to
            consider ways to refinance the borrowings of a tool rental firm
            it owns, said two people with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The refinancing, planned to be about 300 million pounds
            ($492 million), will be used to consolidate HSS Hire Service
            Group Ltd.'s debt and allow for acquisitions, said the people,
            who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exponent, which bought London-based HSS in October 2012 for
            an undisclosed sum from a group that included hedge-fund firm
            Och-Ziff Management Europe Ltd., will examine options such as a
            high-yield bond offering, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSS bought power generation specialist Abird Ltd. in

        <headline>Raytheon, Northrop Lead Defense Stock Downgrades by JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan downgraded Northrop Grumman
            Corp. (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) Co. and Harris Corp., three companies that were
            among the best defense investments in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Following a year in which the group as a whole performed
            surprisingly well, we are downgrading some of the top
            performers,' analyst Joseph Nadol wrote today in a note to
            clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nadol cut Raytheon, the largest missile supplier to the
            U.S. Defense Department, to neutral from overweight. The
            Waltham, Massachusetts-based company returned 23 percent in 2012
            including dividend payments. Raytheon shares fell 1.1 percent to
            close at $57.74 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Northrop Grumman, maker of Global Hawk drones, was revised
            to underweight from neutral. The Falls Church, Virginia-based
            defense contractor returned 20 percent last year. Its shares
            declined 1.9 percent to $67.34. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harris (HRS), a maker of communications equipment, was cut to
            underweight from neutral. The Melbourne, Florida-based company
            returned 40 percent last year. Harris shares fell 2.3 percent,
            the biggest decline in more than two months, to close at $48.91. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Defense contractors face automatic Pentagon cuts totaling
            about $45 billion this year unless the White House and lawmakers
            agree by March 1 to an alternate deficit reduction plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe that Republicans as a group put a higher
            priority on spending cuts than they do on preserving the defense
            budget,' raising the risk no deal will be reached before the
            deadline, Nadol wrote in a separate note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Staley Quits to Join BlueMountain Hedge Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;James E. Staley, the JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) executive once seen as a candidate to become chief executive
            officer, quit to join BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, the
            $12 billion hedge fund that profited from the bank's trading
            loss last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staley, who was at JPMorgan for more than 34 years, will
            become a managing partner and purchase a stake in BlueMountain,
            the New York-based firm said today. The former investment
            banking chief, Staley last year handed off day-to-day management
            duties and became chairman of the corporate and investment bank
            in a series of executive changes as JPMorgan grappled with
            wrong-way bets in its chief investment office in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm very excited to be joining BlueMountain at a time
            when sea changes in the financial industry combined with the
            firm's unique strengths open up enormous possibilities to
            deliver value to clients,' Staley, 56, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staley, who rose from his post as an investment banker in
            Brazil, took over JPMorgan's investment bank in 2010 after chief
            executive officer Jamie Dimon ousted co-heads Steve Black and
            Bill Winters. He was stripped of all day-to-day management
            duties and passed over for promotion in July. He had been
            looking for a new job for several months, according to people
            with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlueMountain, co-founded in 2003 by Andrew Feldstein, who
            helped create the credit-derivatives market while he worked for
            JPMorgan in the 1990s, aided the bank last year as it unwound
            trades at the heart of what became at least $6.2 billion in
            losses at its CIO unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Ethical People' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jes is one of the most experienced and successful leaders
            in the industry and has played a key role at one of the world's
            most successful financial institutions,'Feldstein, the 48-
            year-old chief executive and chief investment officer of
            BlueMountain, said in the statement. 'Not only has he had a
            front row seat for the evolution of the financial industry, but
            he's also one of the most ethical people we've worked with.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlueMountain benefited after a trader in the JPMorgan CIO
            unit, Bruno Iksil, had built a portfolio of credit derivatives
            so large it distorted price relationships in the market, first
            reported by Bloomberg News on April 5. The hedge fund compiled
            offsetting index trades to help JPMorgan unwind the position,
            people familiar with the trading said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staley warned Dimon that supervision and risk controls in
            former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew's division weren't
            strong enough, current and former executives said last year.
            Dimon brushed off the concerns, one of the people said. JPMorgan
            has denied that assertion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Warning Dimon &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staley was moved to a new role in July when Dimon named
            Matt Zames, who worked for Staley in the investment bank, co-
            chief operating officer with Frank Bisignano. London-based
            Barclays Plc and Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc. both considered
            hiring him as CEO during searches last year, the Wall Street
            Journal and CNBC reported at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jes has been an extraordinary leader and a valued partner
            for many of us at JPMorgan over the years,' Dimon said in an e-
            mail to senior managers today. 'While Jes is leaving JPMorgan
            Chase, he is joining a respected private investment firm,
            BlueMountain Capital. BlueMountain is an important client of
            ours, and we look forward to working with Jes in the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feldstein co-founded BlueMountain with Harvard Law friend
            Stephen Siderow in a spinoff from BlueCrest Capital Management
            LLP. Affiliated Managers Group Inc., the company with stakes in
            firms overseeing about $416 billion, last year increased its
            minority stake in BlueMountain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the stake sale to Staley will be invested in
            new infrastructure, technology and people, BlueMountain said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Saudi Fransi Net Sets Strong Expectation for Banks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR), whose fourth-
            quarter profit topped estimates, will probably spur 'upbeat'
            earnings expectations for other banks in the largest Arab
            economy, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest Saudi Arabian lender, part-owned by
            Credit Agricole SA (ACA), said yesterday quarterly profit climbed 22
            percent to 808 million riyals ($215 million). That beat the
            average estimate of five analysts for a profit of 750 million
            riyals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total operating
            income rose 16 percent, while net special commission income
            increased 7 percent to 834 million riyals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is an encouraging start to the Saudi banks'
            reporting,' JPMorgan analysts, including Naresh Bilandani and
            Christian Kern, wrote in a note to clients. It 'will likely set
            upbeat expectations for full-year reporting of peers, given
            investor concerns on the sector post a damp third quarter, which
            was negatively impacted by higher-than-expected provisioning.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian lenders are benefiting from lending to
            government projects as the world's top oil exporter pursues more
            than $500 billion of investments to develop infrastructure and
            create jobs. Al-Rajhi Bank (RJHI), the kingdom's biggest lender by
            market value, will probably post a 7 percent increase in 2012
            net income next week to 7.92 billion riyals, according to the
            mean estimate of fourteen analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Provisions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Saudi banks underperformed the benchmark index
            last year and third-quarter net missed estimates as rising
            provisions against bad loans from construction companies
            eclipsed the fastest loan growth in three years. The Tadawul All
            Share Bank Index rose 0.4 percent in 2012, compared with a 6
            percent gain for the Tadawul. Saudi Fransi shares tumbled 13
            percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has an overweight recommendation on the stock with
            a price estimate of 42 riyals. The shares, which are unchanged

        <headline>JPMorgan, UBS Said to Be Among Banks in Mortgage Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) are
            among banks that received federal requests for information about
            trades in mortgage-backed securities after the financial crisis,
            two people briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigation is in early stages, said the people, who
            asked not to be named because the inquiries were confidential.
            JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, disclosed the probe
            in an August filing, saying it received subpoenas and requests
            for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
            special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program
            and the U.S. Attorney's office in Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest global banks lost billions of dollars on
            mortgage-backed debt during the financial crisis as U.S. home
            prices plunged and the market for such assets dried up. While
            the securities rebounded after the crisis, markets remained
            illiquid with wide spreads between bids from buyers and sellers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley (MS) and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
            are also under scrutiny in the probe, the Wall Street Journal
            reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for New York-based JPMorgan and Zurich-based UBS,
            as well as the banks named by the Journal, said their firms had
            no comment. The SEC's John Nester and Troy Gravitt at the
            special inspector general for TARP in Washington declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys South Korean Stocks Saying Concern Overdone</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management has been
            buying South Korean electronics and auto stocks in recent weeks,
            saying concern that the won's strength will erode exports is
            overblown after valuations fell to eight-year lows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been adding into weakness,' Grace Tam, a Hong
            Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset, which
            oversees about $1.5 trillion, said by phone yesterday. She
            declined to name specific stocks. 'People worry about the
            competitiveness of Korean exports. We think this is overdone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Kospi index has dropped 4.9 percent from last year's
            high on Oct. 30 as the won strengthened 5.9 percent against the
            yen. The benchmark index's valuation fell to about the same
            level as its companies' net assets last week, a 50 percent
            discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index, the widest gap
            since July 2005. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world's biggest
            maker of handsets and televisions, has slumped 14 percent while
            Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (000270), South Korea's largest
            automakers, fell at least 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the
            nation's benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point
            as early as tomorrow to mitigate the won's gains and spur
            growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Hyundai Motor and
            Kia Motors predicted the slowest growth in combined deliveries
            since 2006 on Jan. 2, while Samsung Electronics posted its first
            profit decline in nine quarters yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;International investors sold a net $2.2 billion of Kospi
            shares since the end of October, snapping a record stretch of
            inflows into Asia's fourth-largest economy. The Kospi fell less
            than 0.1 percent to 1,958.96 at the close today. Samsung
            Electronics slipped 1 percent, while Hyundai Motor climbed 0.2
            percent. The two stocks comprise more than 20 percent of the
            Kospi's weighting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks trailed developed-nation equities by
            the most since 1998 last year, leaving the MSCI Emerging Markets
            Index at the biggest valuation discount since 2004. The
            developing-nation gauge trades for 1.5 times net assets, or
            about 31 percent below the multiple on the MSCI World Index,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Improving growth in advanced economies including the U.S.
            will give South Korean exporters a boost in coming months, Tam
            said. The International Monetary Fund plans to raise its global
            growth forecast in coming weeks, Christine Lagarde, the fund's
            managing director, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Korean market is still very cheap,' Tam said.
            'Recent declines gave us good entry points.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yelp Reaches High as JPMorgan Says Ad Growth Will Lift Stock</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Yelp Inc. (YELP), the service for online
            restaurant and local business reviews, climbed to a record after
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) boosted its 12-month target share price for
            the company by 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 7.9 percent to $78.42 at 4 p.m. in New
            York. Yelp's market capitalization has surged more than fivefold
            since the San Francisco-based company's initial public offering
            in March 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yelp is succeeding at getting advertisers to buy their
            promotions in most U.S. cities across many different industries,
            Kaizad Gotla, an analyst at JPMorgan, wrote today in a report.
            The growth could lead the stock to $89 in 12 months, compared
            with his earlier estimate of $75, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's significant room for strong revenue growth and
            margin expansion for Yelp as it remains relatively
            underpenetrated in local advertising,' Gotla wrote. 'The pace
            of innovation in new advertising products is accelerating and
            the company is making good progress towards closing the loop for
            advertisers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan report comes two days after Telsey Advisory
            Group raised its stock price prediction on Yelp to $95 from $62
            on advertising growth. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Traders Aren't Fugitives, Lawyers Tell Judge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) traders
            Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout aren't evading authorities
            in the U.S., where they face charges of engaging in securities
            fraud to hide losses, their lawyers told a judge in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The men, who are accused of hiding losses that eventually
            surpassed $6.2 billion on wrong-way derivatives bets, haven't
            appeared to answer the charges because they live outside the
            U.S., the lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The attorneys objected to a statement by Joseph
            Boryshansky, a lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission, who told U.S. District Judge George Daniels at a
            hearing today that Martin-Artajo and Grout were 'fugitives'
            from the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Martin-Artajo is not a fugitive. He's a Spanish
            citizen who did not flee,' his lawyer, William Leone, told
            Daniels. 'For Mr. Boryshansky to get up and assert Mr. Martin-Artajo is a fugitive from justice is
            completely out of line.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marc Weinstein, a lawyer for Grout, also said his client
            hadn't fled the U.K. to evade extradition to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He was fired, so he could not attempt to live and be
            unemployed in England,' Weinstein said. 'He, his wife and two
            small children moved back to France. He is a citizen of
            France.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Parallel Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who now lives in Spain, oversaw trading
            strategy for the synthetic portfolio at the bank's chief
            investment office in London. Grout was a trader who worked for
            him. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both men were named in an indictment filed by prosecutors
            in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
            September. The SEC alleged in a parallel suit that the two men
            engaged in a scheme to enhance the portfolio's apparent
            performance and thereby curry favor with their supervisors.
            Daniels is presiding over the SEC case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Boryshansky said federal prosecutors probably would seek to
            delay proceedings in the parallel SEC suit so the criminal case
            can proceed first. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for Bharara's office, and
            Peter Donald, a spokesman for the New York office of the Federal
            Bureau of Investigation, declined to comment about the status of
            pending extradition proceedings for both men. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At a conference in Manhattan in October, Lorin Reisner,
            head of the criminal division of Bharara's office, said that
            federal authorities expect that Martin-Artajo would eventually
            be extradited to the U.S. He called Grout's case a 'more
            complicated' matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniels said today he would wait for a formal request from
            prosecutors for a delay in the SEC case. He scheduled the next
            hearing for May 14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-5677, and U.S. v.
            Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Madoff Prosecution Case Deferred by Judge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. prosecution of JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) was deferred by a federal judge after the bank
            agreed to pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil
            allegations it failed to stop Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan's general counsel, pleaded not
            guilty today on behalf of the bank to two violations of the Bank
            Secrecy Act in connection with Madoff at an arraignment before
            U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel. The judge deferred
            prosecution of the case until January 2016, when the case will
            be dismissed if the bank complies with the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The required judicial intervention to protect the
            integrity of the process is not necessary,' Castel ruled. He
            set the next hearing for Jan. 15, 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
            prosecution by entering into an accord with the office of
            Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that acknowledged
            oversight lapses related to a JPMorgan account Madoff used to
            fund his fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion to settle the U.S.
            allegations and $350 million in a related case by the Office of
            the Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover
            separate private claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Reports &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara said yesterday that the criminal charges will be
            dismissed after two years if JPMorgan complies with the
            agreement and implements reforms of its anti-money laundering
            compliance program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan had been Madoff's bank for decades and
            discovered questionable transactions as early as 1994, the New
            York-based bank didn't file any suspicious activity reports
            required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. JPMorgan
            acknowledged in the accord that it ignored red flags for about
            15 years that Madoff used his account to run a fraud, Bharara
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
            forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
            penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
            other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord brings its legal settlements from the past two
            years to more than $29 billion and further eroding its once-record earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The civil case is U.S. v. JPMorgan 14-CV-0063, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. will pay $2.6
            billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it failed
            to stop Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, putting banks on notice
            that they may be punished for their clients' misdeeds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan avoided prosecution by acknowledging in an accord
            with the U.S. yesterday that it ignored red flags for almost two
            decades that Madoff used his account there to run a fraud. The
            bank will pay $1.7 billion to settle the government's
            allegations, $350 million in a related case by the Office of the
            Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover separate
            private claims, the firm said in a filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement includes the 'largest ever bank forfeiture
            and also the largest ever Department of Justice penalty' for a
            violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, Bharara said today in a
            statement. The actions take JPMorgan one step closer to
            resolving a slate of probes that have engulfed the bank since
            the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
            agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve other U.S.
            regulatory probes and still faces investigations of its hiring
            practices in China and the possible manipulation of interest
            rates and currency benchmarks in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have spent years fighting claims by
            Madoff's victims that the companies ignored wrongdoing to
            continue reaping fees. Madoff, 75, maintained accounts with
            JPMorgan for more than 20 years before confessing to running a
            fraud that cost investors about $17 billion. He's serving a 150-year federal prison sentence in North
            Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG incorrectly accounted for a derivative
            transaction with Monte dei Paschi, Welt reported, citing a
            letter the German regulator Bafin sent to the bank in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bafin official Frauke Menke wrote in the letter that
            Deutsche Bank's alleged provision of false information to Bafin
            and other authorities is unacceptable, the German newspaper
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Errors were made due to inefficient communication between
            departments at the company and were later corrected, Welt
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An inadequate investigation of the matter gives the
            impression that Deutsche Bank doesn't take its announced
            cultural change seriously, Menke said, according to Welt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sven Gebauer, a spokesman for Bafin, declined to comment on

            &lt;h2&gt;Former UBS Banker Weil Pleads Not Guilty in Tax-Probe Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raoul Weil, once a top UBS AG banker, pleaded not guilty to
            charges that he conspired to use Swiss bank secrecy to help
            thousands of Americans cheat on their taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weil, 54, appeared yesterday in federal court in Fort
            Lauderdale, Florida, where his lawyer entered the plea on his
            behalf. Weil, a Swiss citizen, first appeared in the court Dec.
            16, five years after he was indicted and declared a fugitive. He
            was arrested Oct. 2 after checking into a hotel in Bologna,
            Italy, and later extradited to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We look forward to coming back to Florida and defending
            him when we have a trial date,' Weil's attorney, Aaron Marcu,
            said outside the courtroom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former head of UBS AG's global wealth-management
            business, Weil is the highest-ranking banker charged in a U.S.
            crackdown on offshore tax evasion. If he doesn't plead guilty
            and cooperate with prosecutors, they must prove that he oversaw
            60 private bankers who helped UBS make $200 million a year by
            managing $20 billion in assets not declared to the Internal
            Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weil is free on $10.5 million bail and staying under house
            arrest in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To prove their case, prosecutors will rely on
            'substantially' the same evidence that led UBS, the biggest
            Swiss bank, to pay $780 million in February 2009 to avoid
            prosecution, Mark Daly, a U.S. Justice Department trial
            attorney, said at Weil's bail hearing on Dec. 16. The Zurich-based bank admitted it helped defraud the U.S.
            by setting up
            accounts that taxpayers hid from the IRS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At last month's hearing, Marcu said his client didn't know
            about a rogue division of bankers. Swiss regulators concluded
            that 'Weil was not involved and was not aware of any wrongdoing
            by any of these underlings who were multiple levels below him,'
            said Marcu of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP in New York.
            'The weight of the evidence at the very best, very best, is
            equivocal.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS must cooperate on 'any matter related to the
            government's criminal investigation' of its cross-border
            business, according to the deferred-prosecution agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If Weil cooperates with prosecutors, they can urge a judge
            to give him a shorter sentence. He faces as long as five years
            in prison. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;SP Loses German Ruling Over Lehman Ratings, Faces Trial &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill Financial that
            provides credit ratings services, lost a bid to block a lawsuit
            by a German investor over its rating of Lehman Brothers' debt
            before the investment bank collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt appeals court ruled that the lawsuit was
            properly served and the case can be heard at lower court. The
            investor bringing the suit seeks EU30,000 for losses incurred
            because of Lehman certificates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Germany's top civil court ruled last year that investors
            can sue SP in German courts over ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP spokeswoman Daniela Markovic didn't immediately reply
            to an e-mail seeking comment &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is: OLG Ffm, 21 U 23/11. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;SEC Promotes Lawyer Who Investigated JPMorgan London Whale Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Osnato, who helped lead a U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission case against JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s handling
            of a $6.2 billion trading loss, was named head of a unit that
            investigates complex financial instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Osnato, 41, joined the SEC in 2008 and became assistant
            director for the New York office in 2010, the SEC said Jan. 6 in
            a statement. He will run a unit that looks into potential
            misconduct linked to asset-backed securities, derivatives and
            other instruments, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of a $920 million settlement with U.S. and U.K.
            regulators, JPMorgan agreed to pay $200 million to resolve SEC
            claims that it violated securities laws in handling its 2012
            trading loss. The Whale nickname was derived from the size of
            the trading positions. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Almarai Rises to Month High as JPMorgan Says Buy: Riyadh Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Almarai Co. (ALMARAI), Saudi Arabia's largest
            food processor by market value, rose to a one-month high as
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) initiated coverage with an overweight
            recommendation based on a pick up in sales and margins. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares climbed 1.5 percent to 66 riyals, the strongest
            level since Dec. 8, at the close in Riyadh, on 97 percent of
            three-month average daily volume. JPMorgan set Almarai's 12-
            month share-price estimate at 87 riyals. The stock helped the
            gauge's 1 percent gain to 7,126.71, the highest since Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almarai, which is benefiting from a pick up in domestic
            demand for poultry and dairy products, may post a 15 percent
            advance in profit this year, JPMorgan said. Saudi Arabia, whose
            $727 billion economy expanded 6.8 percent in 2012, is the most-
            populous nation in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council. The
            company trades at 16 times estimated 2013 earnings, compared
            with 22 times for BRF-Brasil Foods (BRFS3) SA, the world's largest
            poultry exporter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Almarai offers an appealing risk-reward balance to play
            the region's demographic and income growth,' JP Morgan analysts
            including by Muneeza Hasan said in e-mailed report today. The
            company's shares trade at a 14 percent discount to global peers,
            based on 2013 earnings, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almarai may next week report a 9 percent increase in 2012
            profit to 1.4 billion riyals ($373 million), according to the
            average estimate of 14 analysts on Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect near-to-medium term performance to come from
            continued healthy volume growth and a quarter-on-quarter pick up
            in poultry business sales and margins,' JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Four analysts recommend buy Almarai, while 12 say hold and
            two advise to sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            shares advanced 12 percent in 2012, outpacing the benchmark
            index's 6 percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Largest Structured Note Tied to Gold Since 2010</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $35
            million of one-year notes linked to the price of gold, the
            bank's largest offering tied to the precious metal in at least
            three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Jan. 2, yield three times the gains
            of the price of gold in London up to 15.6 percent, with no
            protection against losses and all capital at risk, according to
            a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission. The metal's price increased 8.3 percent last year in
            London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank sold $82.4 million of notes tied to gold in eight
            offerings last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            New York-based JPMorgan issued $27.8 million of one-year
            securities on Oct. 26, the next-largest deal since 2010, when
            Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on U.S. structured
            notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
            declined to comment on the latest offering or future gold notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads 20% Rise in Global Securitization Sales Last Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Global securitization volumes jumped
            20 percent last year to $511.6 billion as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Co.
            widened its lead as the top underwriter, according to newsletter
            Asset-Backed Alert. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan managed the sales for $66.2 billion, or 12.9
            percent, of the total offerings of securities backed by assets
            such as home mortgages, auto debt and speculative-grade company
            loans, according to the newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's share grew from 10.1 percent in 2011 as the New
            York-based firm managed $39.9 billion in sales of asset-backed
            securities tied to U.S. consumer or corporate borrowing, a
            category that excludes mortgage debt and so-called
            collateralized debt obligations. Barclays Plc (BARC) and Bank of
            America Corp., the other top underwriters in that market,
            remained the second- and third-ranked global bookrunners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays handled 10 percent of the global total last year,
            up from 9.2 percent for the London-based bank, according to
            Asset-Backed Alert. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
            America's share climbed to 8.7 percent, from 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Worldwide securitization volumes are down from the record
            $2.57 trillion reached in 2006, a year before U.S. mortgage
            securities and CDOs began a collapse that would spark the worst
            financial crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Securitization fell to $330.6 billion in 2009, excluding
            bonds that were created outside the U.S. to be retained by the
            issuers and pledged as collateral for loans from central banks,
            according to Asset-Backed Alert. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The newsletter's securitization tallies exclude government-
            backed U.S. home-loan bonds and repackagings of that debt called
            agency collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed
            commercial paper and the derivative portions of certain issues. &lt;/p&gt;

            the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banking regulators including the Office of the Comptroller
            of the Currency will soon order the largest U.S. bank to fix
            compliance flaws in its Bank Secrecy Act responsibilities, said
            the person, who declined to be identified because the talks
            aren't public. The order doesn't include monetary penalties and
            is similar to one issued to Citigroup Inc. (C) in April, the person
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, and Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman, declined to
            comment on the order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the 2008 credit crisis companies reduced compliance
            staff tasked with guarding the financial system against the flow
            of illicit money, banking regulators said. HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA),
            Europe's largest bank, agreed last month to pay $1.9 billion to
            settle a money-laundering probe by the U.S. Department of
            Justice and banking regulators in the U.S. and U.K. Another
            London-based bank, Standard Chartered Plc, was fined a total of
            $667 million by U.S. regulators last year for facilitating
            transactions with Iran in violation of sanctions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a separate OCC probe, Treasury Department Inspector
            General Eric Thorson threatened to sanction the bank if it fails
            to turn over documents to regulators investigating its ties to
            Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme, giving JPMorgan a deadline of
            today to cooperate with the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OCC is also investigating the 2012 trading losses in
            JPMorgan's chief investment office and is preparing an
            enforcement action, according to another person briefed on the
            situation who asked not to be named because the matter isn't
            public. The cease-and-desist order would require the bank to fix
            internal risk controls, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blavatnik Takes JPMorgan to Trial for Subprime Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) filled a fund started by billionaire Leonard Blavatnik with risky mortgage
            securities instead of the conservative investments it was told to make, lawyers for Blavatnik told a New
            York state judge today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 55, sued New York-based JPMorgan in New York state
            Supreme Court in June 2009, accusing the biggest U.S. bank by assets of putting more money into mortgage
            securities than his investment guidelines allowed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CMMF fund was started by
            Blavatnik's Access Industries in 2006 as a 'short-term, highly liquid and very conservative cash management
            account,' according to court filings. JPMorgan 'stuffed' the account with risky mortgage securities, turning
            it into something it was never meant to be, said Richard I. Werder Jr., an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
            Urquhart Sullivan LLP, which is representing the fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This was not supposed to be a
            high-risk, swing-for-the- fences investment,' Werder told state Supreme Court Justice Melvin Schweitzer at
            the start of a non-jury trial over Blavatnik's lawsuit that began in Manhattan today. 'This was supposed to
            be the opposite: conservative and safe.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan should be held responsible for the
            loss, Blavatnik, who is ranked 47th in Bloomberg's billionaires index with a net worth of $15.3 billion,
            said in his lawsuit, because it loaded his Access Industries fund with subprime and Alt-A mortgages while
            Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was unloading such securities from the bank's books. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Sucker's
            Bet' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This was a sucker's bet,' Werder said in a pretrial brief. 'If it paid off, CMMF
            would merely recoup its principal. By making this massive bet -- which was completely unnecessary to achieve
            the account's conservative objectives -- JPM breached the parties' agreement, acted negligently and caused
            enormous and avoidable losses of approximately $100 million.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The securities being
            challenged by CMMF had 'extraordinary protection' against 'all but the most catastrophic losses,' hadn't
            defaulted while the bank managed the account and were AAA-rated when purchased, Lewis R. Clayton of Paul
            Weiss Rifkind Wharton Garrison LLP, which is representing JPMorgan, told Schweitzer during opening arguments
            today. The securities had no downgrades until March 2008, Clayton said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Were Safe'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The market believed these securities were safe,' Clayton said. 'Their own investment
            advisers believed these investments were safe.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has argued that CMMF rejected
            the 'most conservative strategy' it was offered in favor of one that sought a higher return than a
            money-market fund, with higher risk and less liquidity, Clayton said in a pretrial memorandum. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The account performed well until the fall of 2007, when events in the mortgage markets and the
            economy 'began to have a negative impact,' Clayton wrote in the memorandum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            Investment Management believed that prices for the asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
            obligations in the account were depressed because of 'short-term liquidity problems, not because of a
            realistic risk of loss of principal,' and thought CMMF should hold the investments for the long term and not
            take losses at 'artificially depressed prices,' according to Clayton's memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;View
            'Shared' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This view was shared by CMMF's independent adviser, Nancy Zimmerman, a
            sophisticated financial professional who manages a multibillion-dollar hedge fund,' Clayton said in the
            pretrial memo. 'CMMF also repeatedly made clear that it did not want to realize losses and objected
            vociferously when JPMIM sold one investment at a loss of approximately 5 percent.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            account generated a net gain of almost $4 million until CMMF closed it in May 2008 and gave the securities
            to Zimmerman to manage, Clayton said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial is set to last as long as
            two weeks. Blavatnik isn't scheduled to testify, according to a list of witnesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            case is CMMF LLC v. J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., 601924-09, New York State Supreme Court
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Ordered to Fix Controls, Pay Practices After Whale Bet</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was ordered by U.S. regulators to strengthen risk controls and enhance
            executive compensation practices after losing more than $6.2 billion on a wrong-way derivatives bet last
            year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve found deficiencies in JPMorgan's risk controls, loss modeling
            and audit functions as well as the process for alerting the board of directors to problems. The central bank
            and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency both issued cease-and-desist orders yesterday requiring
            JPMorgan to tighten its trading oversight, particularly in the chief investment office, and separate orders
            to bolster systems preventing clients from laundering money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The orders show there are
            'significant control weaknesses beyond the CIO's office that raises questions about whether JPMorgan is that
            much better than its peers at risk management,' said Josh Rosner, an analyst at New York-based Graham Fisher
            Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are the first regulatory sanctions against JPMorgan in response to the botched
            trades, which Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, said in May stemmed from 'egregious' lapses. Bruno
            Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were big enough to move markets,
            made the wrong- way bet on credit derivatives that fueled the losses. As much as $51 billion in shareholder
            value had been erased at one point. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sanctions are relatively light, allowing
            JPMorgan to avoid fines, Rosner said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.K. Probe &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other U.S.
            agencies investigating the trading loss include the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Bureau of
            Investigation. The U.K.'s Financial Services Authority said yesterday that it's undertaking a formal
            enforcement probe, which typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of financial rule
            violations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Conclusions will be reached in the enforcement investigation in due course
            and any further appropriate action determined at that time,' the FSA said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Fed gave JPMorgan's board 60 days to submit a plan to enhance oversight of risk-management, internal-audit
            and finance functions. The panel also must overhaul its system for compensating top executives, accounting
            for 'adverse risk outcomes and control deficiencies,' according to a Fed order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Internal
            Report &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank's board is considering releasing an internal report that faults Dimon's
            oversight of the CIO when the company announces fourth-quarter results tomorrow, two people with direct
            knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That report, which builds on a preliminary analysis
            released in July, is critical of senior managers including Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug
            Braunstein, 52, and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately supervising traders in the
            U.K., according to the people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report will be presented to the board when it meets
            today. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            didn't admit or deny wrongdoing in consenting to the regulatory orders issued yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We've
            been working hard to fully remediate the issues identified in the consent order' on the trading losses, Joe
            Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An OCC order found that the bank
            also 'has an inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing' for anti- money-laundering
            compliance. The company 'failed to identify significant volumes of suspicious activity' and to file required
            reports alerting regulators, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meeting those 'responsibilities --
            and going above and beyond -- is a top priority for us,' Evangelisti said. 'We have already made progress
            addressing the issues cited in the consent orders, which contain no allegations of intentional misconduct by
            the firm or any of its employees.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Seen Facing U.S., U.K. Actions on Whale Trades</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is set to face
            new actions from U.S. and U.K. bank regulators as early as today
            for botched trades that cost the company more than $6.2 billion
            last year, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and
            Federal Reserve, which have been investigating the loss, may
            release some of their findings today, three people familiar with
            the matter said. The U.K.'s Financial Services Authority, which
            has also been informally looking into whether traders
            intentionally mismarked some of their positions and tried to
            cover up their losses, may open an official investigation,
            according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators have yet to punish New York-based JPMorgan, the
            biggest U.S. bank, for lapses in risk oversight that Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56, has called 'egregious.' It
            isn't clear whether the Fed and OCC's announcement will also
            include sanctions, according to the people, who asked not to be
            named because the matter hasn't been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OCC is preparing a cease-and-desist order requiring New
            York-based JPMorgan to fix internal controls that contributed to
            its wrong-way bet on credit derivatives, a person familiar with
            the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The chief investment office within JPMorgan's national bank
            suffered from 'inadequate risk management,' Comptroller of the
            Currency Thomas Curry said during U.S. Senate testimony in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Potential Gaps' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been focusing on potential gaps or deviations
            from accepted standards of risk management within that
            particular office and looking to see whether similar gaps exist
            in any other area,' Curry said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move to a formal enforcement proceeding by the FSA
            typically indicates the agency found sufficient evidence of
            financial rule violations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman at JPMorgan, Robert Garsson at
            the OCC, Barbara Hagenbaugh at the Federal Reserve and
            Christopher Hamilton at the FSA all declined to comment on the
            regulatory actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's board of directors is also considering releasing
            an internal report that faults Dimon's oversight of the division
            when the company announces fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 16,
            two people with direct knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Braunstein, Drew &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The final report, which builds on a preliminary analysis
            released in July, is critical of senior managers including
            Dimon, former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein, 51,
            and ex-Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 56, for inadequately
            supervising traders in the U.K. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The report will be presented to the board when it meets
            tomorrow. The directors will then vote on whether to disclose it
            when the bank announces fourth-quarter results the following
            day, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
            report isn't yet public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bruno Iksil, the U.K. trader nicknamed the London Whale
            because his trading book was big enough to move the market, made
            a wrong-way bet on credit derivatives that led to the company's
            biggest trading loss. At one point, as much as $51 billion in

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s quarterly profit fell 7.3 percent on $2.6 billion of settlements tied to
            Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme as rising legal costs ended the firm's three-year streak of record annual
            earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income declined to $5.28 billion, or $1.30 a share, from
            $5.69 billion, or $1.39, a year earlier, according to a statement today from New York-based JPMorgan, the
            biggest U.S. bank. Results excluding the Madoff settlement and other one-time items were $1.40 a share.
            Twenty-two analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated $1.37 on average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is whittling down the firm's list of legal woes that include allegations it misled
            buyers of mortgage bonds, rigged markets and turned a blind eye to suspicious activity by customers. The
            Madoff agreement, which the bank said last week reduced fourth-quarter profit by about $850 million, capped
            a year in which JPMorgan spent more than $23 billion on legal settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Shrinks Investment Bank Compensation Pool 4.2%</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and
            investment bank allocated 4.2 percent less for employee
            compensation last year as the division's revenue was little
            changed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $10.8 billion in compensation fell to 30 percent
            of revenue, excluding accounting adjustments, from 32 percent in
            2012, according to figures posted today on the New York-based
            firm's website. The amount equals $207,368 for each of the
            division's 52,250 employees. The unit employed 52,022 people a
            year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has struggled to
            meet expense goals amid surging litigation costs and efforts to
            improve compliance. The company wouldn't penalize employees for
            losses tied to bad loans sold by firms it acquired amid the
            financial crisis, including Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington
            Mutual Inc.'s banking operations, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's hard to look at JPMorgan and say you're going to
            blame people at JPMorgan, the existing employees, for what
            happened with Bear Stearns and WaMu,' said Dimon, 57. 'We've
            never blamed employees broadly for mistakes we made away from
            them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Compensation at the corporate and investment bank, run by
            Mike Cavanagh, 48, and Daniel Pinto, 51, includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
            years. Figures for average pay don't represent what individuals
            actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Replaces 2 Million Bank Cards After Target Breach</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. bank, said it replaced 2 million payment cards after the
            breach of consumer data at retailers including Target Corp. (TGT) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The threat to
            cardholder information 'is a big deal, it's not going to go away,' Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
            today on a conference call discussing fourth-quarter results at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Target,
            the second-largest U.S. discount chain, said late last year that credit- and debit-card data from 40 million
            accounts were compromised. The retailer said Jan. 10 that the recent security breach affected more people
            and more information than previously thought. Payments information was also compromised at Neiman Marcus
            Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            Target Sued by Connecticut Bank Over Fallout From Data Breach
            &lt;p&gt;'This story is not over, unfortunately,' Dimon, 57, said. 'You really have to put in extreme effort
            to protect yourself.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stores and banks need to cooperate to prevent information from
            being breached rather than casting blame, Dimon said today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This might be a chance for
            retailers and banks to, for once, work together, you know, as opposed to sue each other, like we've been
            doing the last decade,' he said. 'All of us have a common interest in being protected.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Putnam
            Bank filed a suit against Target, claiming that the security breakdown cost the lender money because it
            forced the bank to issue customer alerts and new cards, while reimbursing account holders for losses.
            Credit-card lender American Express Co. (AXP) said this month that it's appealing a federal judge's order
            approving a $5.7 billion settlement by Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. after years of litigation with U.S.
            merchants over allegations that credit-card swipe fees are improperly fixed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. in Talks on Global Services Trade Sought by JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. will participate in global
            talks to lower barriers on trade of financial services and
            telecommunications, a step toward a deal sought by companies
            including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and ATT Inc. (T) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Negotiations will include 20 trading partners, including
            the European Union, at the World Trade Organization in Geneva,
            U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said today in a letter to
            congressional leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Every $1 billion in U.S. services exports supports an
            estimated 4,200 U.S. jobs in America,' Kirk wrote to House
            Speaker John Boehner and Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy. The negotiations will begin within 90
            days, Kirk said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Services such as express package delivery, insurance,
            telecommunications and electronic payments are becoming a
            growing part of global trade, estimated by the WTO at about $8
            trillion in 2011. U.S. exports of private services were worth
            about $600 billion in 2011, according to Kirk's office. The U.S.
            had a $178.5 billion surplus in services trade that year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nations working toward an agreement represent about 70
            percent of the world's trade in services, according to the
            Coalition of Service Industries, a Washington-based group whose
            members include JPMorgan, ATT, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), FedEx Corp. (FDX) and
            Aflac Inc. (AFL) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Engine &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased that the United States is ready to fight
            for new trade rules to enable the services sector to achieve its
            potential as the engine of our economy,' Peter Allgeier, a
            former U.S. ambassador to the WTO and president of the services
            group, said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Industry groups including the Washington-based U.S. Chamber
            of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, whose members include
            the heads of companies including Bank of America Corp., Visa
            Inc. (V) and Verizon Communications Inc., cheered the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a chance to tackle emerging trade barriers in
            areas such as the digital economy while strengthening the global
            rules-based trading system,' Myron Brilliant, the Chamber's
            senior vice president for international affairs, said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican and head of
            the Ways and Means Committee that oversees trade legislation,
            said the services agreement is a 'critical trade policy' that
            will help create U.S. jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;WTO Members &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am impressed with the group of 21 WTO members thus far
            that plan to join the negotiations, representing dymanic
            devleoping and developed markets for U.S. exports,' Camp said
            in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nations in the talks are Australia, Canada, Chile, Taiwan,
            Colombia, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea,
            Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Switzerland
            and Turkey. The EU represents 27 nations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil, China and India have declined to join, saying the
            efforts may impede broader global trade talks that have been
            stalled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Discussions probably will cover the cross-border movement
            of financial data, information and communications services,
            maritime, environmental and energy services and government
            procurement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Avianca Climbs for Fifth Day as JPMorgan Picks Colombian Airline</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Avianca Holdings SA, Colombia's
            biggest airline, gained for a fifth straight day to the highest
            since May as JPMorgan Chase Co. called the stock its top pick
            among Latin American carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 4.1 percent to 4,405 pesos at 3:09 p.m. in
            Bogota, extending the rally this month to 19 percent, which
            makes the stock the best performer on the Colcap. They fell 18
            percent last year after surging 38 percent in 2012. The five-day
            winning streak is Avianca's longest in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan initiated coverage last month of the company's
            American depositary receipts with an overweight rating, or the
            equivalent of buy, and a $24 price target. In a research note
            today, JPMorgan analysts Fernando Abdalla and Carlos Louro cited
            the company's attractive valuation and market leadership. The
            ADRs, which started trading in November, rose 3.6 percent to a
            record $18.13 today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Practically every analyst has a much higher target than
            the price right now,' Juan Pablo Vieira, a Medellin-based
            trader at brokerage Serfinco SA, said by phone. 'It's being
            supported by the good numbers the company keeps publishing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The airline said today that passengers during the holiday
            period from Dec. 13 to Jan. 12 rose to a record 1.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avianca's ADRs are rated the equivalent of buy by six other
            analysts, with no hold or sell ratings. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan With Wells Fargo Lose Share to Small Rivals: Mortgages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The two largest U.S. home lenders
            are feeling the bite of competition from smaller firms as
            mortgage originations tumble at the fastest rate since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New loans at Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the biggest, fell 38
            percent to $50 billion in the fourth quarter from the third
            quarter, the bank said in a statement yesterday. At JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) originations decreased 42 percent to $23.3 billion,
            outpacing the 27 percent fourth-quarter drop forecast by the
            Mortgage Bankers Association for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Big banks are facing dual challenges of increased
            competition and a plunge in home loan refinancing after the
            Federal Reserve said it planned to reduce monthly bond purchases
            and sent mortgage rates soaring. Smaller lenders are helped
            because the market is shifting to one led by mortgages for home
            purchases, favoring firms that can capture the buyers'
            attention, said Clifford Rossi, a former Citigroup Inc. (C) risk
            manager who now teaches at the University of Maryland's Robert
            H. Smith School of Business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot of these guys are using the internet and social
            media platforms to reach borrowers more directly,' Rossi said.
            Due to their 'ability to be more nimble and opportunistic in
            the marketplace, you will see more companies like that be able
            to do more.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Anne Pfeiffer, Ex-JPMorgan Real-Estate Funds Chief, Dies at 61</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Anne Pfeiffer, a JPMorgan (JPM) Chase
            Co. managing director for real estate who led the bank's $23
            billion Strategic Property Fund until retiring in October, has
            died. She was 61. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She died on Jan. 12 in her Manhattan home following a 20-month battle with pancreatic cancer,
            according to her husband,
            Paul Pfeiffer. She had been under hospice care since Christmas
            Eve, he said yesterday in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A member of JPMorgan's real-estate financing unit for
            almost 35 years, Pfeiffer managed a seven-person portfolio-management team as head of the New York-based
            bank's commingled
            property funds, which are pension trusts catering to retirement
            and governmental plans. Under her leadership, the Strategic
            Property Fund, JPMorgan's core real-estate portfolio, was the
            largest of its kind. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anne has been a masterful portfolio manager, an
            inspirational leader, a talented colleague and a true friend,'
            Kevin Faxon, the bank's head of real estate for the Americas,
            wrote in a letter to clients in July to announce her retirement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in the Strategic Property Fund, of which she was
            senior portfolio manager, included the Public School Teachers
            Pension Retirement Fund of Chicago and the New York City
            Employees' Retirement System, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The assets included the Landmark Center in Boston,
            Century Park in Los Angeles and International Toy Center in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fund Portfolio &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other real-estate funds she oversaw included the Special
            Situation Property Fund, with $3.1 billion of assets; the
            Alternative Property Fund, with $647 million in holdings; the
            Diversified Commercial Property Fund, a $372.8 million defined-contribution vehicle; and the $2.3 billion
            U.S. Income Growth
            Fund, according to an overview of the investments last February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From 2002 to 2008, Pfeiffer was on the board of directors
            at the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries,
            and president in 2007 and 2008. The Chicago-based association of
            institutional real-estate professionals addresses industry
            issues and promotes research, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfeiffer was elected to the board of the Real Estate
            Information Standards for a three-year term starting in January
            2012. The group is sponsored by the National Council of Real
            Estate Investment Fiduciaries and the Pension Real Estate
            Association 'to facilitate informed investment decision-making,' according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Dearly Loved' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anne was a friend and mentor to so many people she worked
            with at the firm,' her husband said, summarizing the e-mails he
            had received since her death. 'She was dearly loved and revered
            among her co-workers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anne Shultz Pfeiffer was born on Aug. 10, 1952, in Aurora,
            Illinois. Her father, Robert Shultz, was a Dartmouth College-educated businessman who had a manufacturing
            firm in the Chicago
            area. Her mother, Elizabeth, was a registered nurse. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She attended Naperville Central High School in Naperville,
            Illinois, before completing a Bachelor of Business
            Administration degree at Southern Methodist University in
            Dallas. A certified public accountant, Pfeiffer began her career
            at Coopers Lybrand, where she was a supervising accountant,
            before the firm merged with Price Waterhouse in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pfeiffer joined JPMorgan in 1979 as the senior finance
            officer and served as head of the finance group, as a senior
            asset manager and an acquisitions officer, according to
            JPMorgan's website. She was responsible for the origination,
            analysis and negotiation of commercial real-estate transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her passions included travel and art, and she played a
            mentoring role to young women in finance and business, according
            to Paul Pfeiffer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to her husband, her survivors include their two
            children, Christof and Kirsten, and her mother. A sister, Mary,
            and brother Nicholas preceded her in death. &lt;/p&gt;

            future losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income climbed to $5.69 billion, or $1.39 a share, from $3.73
            billion, or 90 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. JPMorgan earned
            $1.35 a share excluding one-time items such as accounting adjustments and costs from a mortgage settlement,
            compared with the $1.22 estimate for adjusted earnings by 28 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            firm's results reflected strong underlying performance across virtually all our businesses for the fourth
            quarter and the full year, with strong lending and deposit growth,' Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 56,
            said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan capped its third-straight year of record profits with
            $21.3 billion in net income, even after suffering its biggest trading loss ever. The bank faces regulatory
            sanctions and investigations by U.S. and international authorities stemming from the loss over a wrong-way
            bet on credit derivatives. The mistake cost JPMorgan more than $6.2 billion in the first nine months of last
            year, and the board cut Dimon's 2012 pay in half as a result. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Leu Climbs to One-Year High on Romanian Entry to JPMorgan Index</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Romania's leu strengthened to its
            highest level in a year after JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said the
            country's domestic bonds are eligible for its emerging-market
            government bond index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currency advanced 0.1 percent to 4.3355 per euro by
            11:30 a.m. in Bucharest, after adding as much as 0.4 percent to
            the highest intraday level since Jan. 30 last year. The yield on
            Romania's June 2019 euro-denominated bonds slid one basis point,
            or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.78 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The exchange rate soared 1 percent yesterday, the most
            since Aug. 6, after JPMorgan said Romania's domestic bonds would
            be added to its GBI-EM Index series from March 1, spurring
            expectations of orders from fund managers seeking to replicate
            the benchmark gauge. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Since yesterday's announcement was made after the home
            market closed, the central bank had no chance to react to the
            rapid appreciation,' Dan Bucsa, a London-based economist at
            UniCredit SpA (UCG), wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inclusion in the index would be phased over a three-month
            period ending May 1, JPMorgan said in a note to clients
            yesterday. Romania's weighting on completion is estimated at
            0.54 percent of the GBI-EM Global Diversified index. Its entry
            is 'subject to final determination,' JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank, which has restricted its supply of leu at
            its weekly repurchase auctions since October to help prop up the
            currency, increased the limit to 6 billion lei ($1.8 billion) on
            Jan. 14 from 4 billion lei a week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the central bank is unlikely to 'hint at any desired
            euro/leu level nor to strongly intervene to force the leu to
            depreciate significantly,' it prefers a more stable currency
            closer to 4.4 per euro, Bucsa said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan European Equity Sales Trader Candillier Dies at 37</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Thomas Candillier, the Paris-based
            head of European cash equity sales at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), has
            died at the age of 37. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment on the cause of death.
            Candillier is survived by his wife and children. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman in London,
            said Candillier will be 'dearly missed.' The trader joined
            JPMorgan in 2001 after starting his financial career in energy
            derivative sales at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 1999.
            Candillier, who rose in the ranks at JPMorgan's cash equity
            sales unit in Europe, was educated at France's ESSEC Business
            School, according to his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He 'was a wonderful leader, colleague, mentor, and
            friend,' Patrick Burrowes, head of cash equities for Europe,
            Middle East and Africa, and other senior colleagues at the New
            York-based bank said in a memo to employees yesterday.
            Candillier passed away on Jan. 14, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His previous roles at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
            assets, included running the French sales team for cash
            equities. He was promoted to executive director in 2005 at
            JPMorgan and was most recently a managing director at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our thoughts are with his family during this most
            difficult time,' Burrowes and his colleagues said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was the third-largest broker by reported equity
            trades in German exchanges last year, and fourth in London and
            Paris, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Corporate and Investment Bank Pay Pool Falls 3% in 2012</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and investment bank cut employee compensation costs 3 percent
            in 2012 to $11.3 billion as the division generated 1 percent more revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expense
            was enough to give each of the division's 52,151 employees $216,928, according to figures posted today on
            the New York-based company's website. In 2011, the unit set aside $11.7 billion to pay traders, dealmakers
            and other personnel, or $217,600 for each of the 53,557 people on staff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            combined its investment bank with the firm's corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last
            year, and placed Mike Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto in charge of the division. The fourth quarter was the first
            that the bank reported the combined results of the entire group, which has more than double the employees
            than the investment bank alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pay costs for the year were 33 percent of revenue at the
            corporate and investment bank, down from 34 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for
            compensation includes salaries, bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous years. Figures
            for average pay don't represent what individuals actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Whale Report Spreads Blame as Dimon's Pay Halved</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), detailing lapses behind its biggest-ever trading loss, said employees
            were overwhelmed by the complexity of their bets, risk managers were ill-equipped and leaders including
            Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon weren't aggressive enough in responding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a
            129-page report issued yesterday, the bank described an 'error prone' risk-modeling system that required
            employees to cut and paste electronic data to a spreadsheet. Workers inadvertently used the sum of two
            numbers instead of the average in calculating volatility. The firm also reiterated an assertion that London
            traders initially tried to hide losses that ballooned beyond $6.2 billion in last year's first nine months.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investigation, overseen by Dimon confidante Mike Cavanagh, is part of an effort to
            overhaul the bank and rebuild investor trust after the trading debacle helped cut shareholder value by as
            much as $51 billion last year. The report doesn't explain why the chief investment office, a unit
            responsible for managing cash and mitigating risk, departed from more conservative strategies, eventually
            amassing a portfolio of complex credit derivatives. Dimon's pay for last year was cut in half following the
            losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The people who conduct these internal investigations walk a fine line,' said
            David Felt, a lawyer with Arnall Golden Gregory in Washington. 'Their job is to find out what happened and
            prevent it from reoccurring, but not to provide evidence to prosecutors and other litigators.' Felt, who
            specializes in corporate inquiries, helped oversee the regulatory investigations into accounting fraud at
            Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac for the Federal Housing Finance Agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;London Whale
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan first disclosed losses on the trades in May, almost a month after Dimon
            dismissed initial news reports on the bets as a 'tempest in a teapot.' Transactions were handled by
            London-based trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because his positions were so big. Dimon, 56,
            said yesterday the bank is almost done with losses in the CIO and won't disclose the size of future
            declines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board of directors cut the CEO's compensation for 2012 to $11.5 million.
            The decision was announced as the firm reported a 53 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit to $5.69 billion,
            driven by earnings on mortgages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the
            failures that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility,' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh,
            who has worked with or for Dimon since 1993, led the management task force that produced the report. Dimon
            promoted him from chief financial officer to run the treasury and security services division in June 2010,
            and again last July to co-head the corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'More Independent'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I would have much rather seen a more-independent report,' said Paul Miller, an analyst
            at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. 'Let's say that Cavanagh is a straight-up, straight-shooting
            guy who's going to do this effectively. Nobody is going to believe it.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti,
            a spokesman for the bank, said Cavanagh answered to the independent committee of the board, which also
            conducted its own review. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The loss at JPMorgan, considered one of the industry's
            best-managed firms after remaining profitable during the credit crisis, has prompted lawsuits and probes in
            the U.S. and abroad. This week, it led to the first regulatory sanctions, as banking watchdogs found
            internal-control 'deficiencies.' It also has pushed lawmakers to tighten trading curbs included in the 2010
            Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Too Trusting &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CIO unit used credit derivatives
            as part of a hedging strategy, and the trades became so large the bank couldn't easily unwind them. The
            report blamed managers, many of whom were reassigned or left last year, for roles in failing to halt the
            loss. The executives include former Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, Barry Zubrow, ex-head of companywide
            risk management, and former Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read the full
            JPMorgan Chase Co. report&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon was faulted for trusting information given him by senior
            managers, according to the task force. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He could have better tested his reliance on what
            he was told,' the firm found. 'More should have been done regarding the risks, risk controls and personnel
            associated with CIO's activities, and Mr. Dimon bears some responsibility.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, who
            is also chairman of the board, wasn't included in deliberations on his compensation, he told reporters on a
            conference call. The bank said its decisions took into account his replacement of senior managers, efforts
            to claw back their pay and the formation of a team to examine what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Embarrassing
            Mistake' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Once Mr. Dimon became aware of the seriousness of the issues presented by
            CIO, he responded forcefully by directing a thorough review and an extensive program of remediation,' the
            company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The board had to look at the positives, which I think are large, and the
            negatives,' Dimon said. 'This is one huge embarrassing mistake and I respect their decision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Executives failed to ensure that the CIO's risk controls kept pace with the increased complexity of
            the unit's activities, the task force said. The leaders didn't verify that the unit was well managed or had
            the same level of risk controls as elsewhere at the firm, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Significant
            risk-management weaknesses developed within CIO that allowed the traders to pursue their flawed and risky
            trading strategies,' the bank said. 'Senior firm management's view of CIO had not evolved to reflect the
            increasingly complex and risky strategies CIO was pursuing.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Traders Ousted &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon ousted three London traders involved in the loss, shuffled senior managers and accepted
            resignations from executives including Drew. Matt Zames, the former co-head of fixed-income trading, was
            promoted twice last year and, after helping overhaul the CIO, is now co-chief operating officer with Frank
            Bisignano. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew retired four days after the loss was disclosed May 10. Iksil, his
            supervisor Javier Martin-Artajo and the former CIO head in Europe, Achilles Macris, also left. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zubrow, who had overseen JPMorgan's risk-management function while Iksil expanded his book, retired
            at the end of last year. Braunstein, 52, stepped down to become a vice chairman in the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the years before the trading losses, Dimon had pushed the CIO to generate more profit by
            boosting the size and risk of its bets to include higher-yielding assets, Bloomberg News reported in April,
            citing former executives. The shift had made the unit an increasingly important customer to Wall Street's
            trading desks, with bets that could move markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Probe's Focus &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            task force wrote in a footnote to its report that while it had reviewed 'certain background information' on
            how the CIO expanded into credit derivatives, its focus 'was on the events at the end of 2011 and the first
            several months of 2012 when the losses occurred.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also highlighted blunders
            tied to measuring risk. Dimon had previously said switching models understated the chance of losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CIO exceeded its so-called value-at-risk limit 'at several points' during a period in January
            2012, driven by the synthetic credit portfolio, JPMorgan said in the report. The office recommended a
            temporary increase in the risk limit, as the new model was expected to show a 'substantially' reduced
            measure of the amount in danger of being lost. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 23, a trader e-mailed the person
            who developed the new model to say he should 'keep the pressure on our friends in model validation and
            [quantitative research],' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flaws Overlooked &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There
            is some evidence the Model Review Group accelerated its review as a result of this pressure, and in so doing
            it may have been more willing to overlook the operational flaws apparent during the approval process,'
            according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk model was developed by a London-based quantitative
            expert who had not previously created or implemented such a model and wasn't given the support he requested,
            JPMorgan said. The firm's review of the model wasn't 'as rigorous as it should have been,' JPMorgan said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also found the spreadsheet used the sum of two numbers, rather than their
            average, as part of a risk calculation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This error likely had the effect of muting
            volatility by a factor of two,' according to the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve and Office
            of the Comptroller of the Currency on Jan. 14 took the first regulatory actions stemming from the trade,
            ordering the bank to strengthen risk and auditing controls. The board of directors also was told to consider
            control weaknesses and 'adverse risk outcomes' while awarding compensation for Dimon and other top managers.

        <headline>JPMorgan Lowers Buyback Request to Less Than $12 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, reduced its 2013 stock-repurchase request with
            federal bank regulators by at least 20 percent after suffering
            its biggest trading loss ever last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan asked the Federal Reserve if it could buy back
            less than $3 billion per quarter when it submitted its annual
            capital request in January, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon,
            56, told analysts on a conference call today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed forced the New York-based company to suspend a $15
            billion stock-buyback program last year after the bank in May
            acknowledged losses in a credit-derivatives portfolio that
            eventually swelled to more than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan's board
            of directors cut Dimon's pay for 2012 in half after a review of
            the losses in the chief investment office held him responsible
            for the botched trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had repurchased $1.6 billion of the $15 billion in
            authorized share buybacks when the Fed suspended the program.
            The central bank later approved the repurchase of $3 billion in
            additional shares in the first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of
            the original buyback goal unused. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon said he is inclined to buy back shares when the price
            of the stock falls below tangible book value. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Mining Loan Rebound Amid Price Slump: Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is leading a
            rebound in bank lending to mining and energy companies, which
            are taking out the most loans since 2011 to refinance debt as
            commodity prices slump and acquisitions slow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw-material industries boosted borrowing by 17 percent
            last year to $684.7 billion, after a 22 percent drop in 2012,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. The top lenders were U.S. banks
            JPMorgan at $57.1 billion, Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) at $47.1 billion
            and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) at $37.8 billion. The figures reflect
            transactions involving more than one bank and include credit
            lines, project or term loans and trade finance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While increased scrutiny from regulators is prompting
            JPMorgan and other banks to exit physical commodity businesses
            such as warehouses and power plants, lending rose as companies
            including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc refinanced
            to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Tumbling metal prices
            also eroded revenue at mines and smelters last year during the
            first commodity slump since the recession of 2008, while the
            value of mergers and acquisitions slid 31 percent, data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was generally not a good year for commodities in 2013,
            and that required companies to raise external financing,' said
            Larry Landry, vice chairman of investment banking for JPMorgan
            in New York. 'There will be less opportunistic-driven
            refinancing in 2014, but hopefully that will be offset by a
            meaningful pickup in mergers and acquisitions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BofA Overtakes JPMorgan for Investment-Banking Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. lender, took in more investment-banking fees than
            larger rival JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) for the first time since acquiring Merrill Lynch Co. during the
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fees for debt and equity issuance, as well as advice for activities
            including mergers, rose 17 percent to $6.41 billion last year at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
            America. That edged out New York-based JPMorgan's $6.33 billion in such revenue for the first time since
            2008. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America's investment-banking operations, run by Christian Meissner and
            overseen by Chief Operating Officer Thomas Montag, benefited from a record year in debt underwriting as
            corporations took advantage of all-time low rates for junk bonds ahead of Federal Reserve plans to withdraw
            stimulus. The question is whether the firm's business can maintain its top rank when rates rise, said
            Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'It's not even close to sustainable,' Peabody said in a telephone interview of the jump in fees
            from debt. 'It wouldn't shock me if fixed-income revenues, issuance and trading, were down 20 percent in
            2014. Over the course of the year, rising rates will become a dislocative factor that will cut that pipeline
            at some point.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Executive Barred for Passing Inside Tips</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            executive was barred from the brokerage industry for allegedly
            passing inside information on corporate mergers to a friend, the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Michael Gutman, a vice president in the conflicts
            office at JPMorgan's brokerage unit, shared tips on deals from
            March 2006 to October 2007 with Christopher John Tyndall, who
            then made trades based on the information, the brokerage
            industry's self-regulator said in a statement today. Tyndall was
            also barred, Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'David Gutman had the keys to the kingdom through his
            position at JPMorgan as a gatekeeper with special access to
            material, non-public information,' Cameron Funkhouser, a Finra
            vice president, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gutman tipped Tyndall, then a broker at New York-based
            Meyers Associates LP, to at least 15 pending corporate mergers
            and acquisitions, Finra said. Tyndall then passed the
            information to 13 of his retail customers and invested
            personally in at least two securities, according to the
            complaint. The scheme generated more than $9 million in profits,
            Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In settling the claims, Gutman and Tyndall didn't admit or
            deny wrongdoing. Susan Brune, Gutman's lawyer, declined to
            comment, as did JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony. George
            Meierhofer, a lawyer for Tyndall, didn't immediately return a
            phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Asian Currencies Extending Rout on Economy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Asian currencies are poised to
            extend declines amid concern an increase in borrowing costs in
            China and a weakening yen threaten economic growth in the
            region, JPMorgan Chase Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A trend of bearish' Asian currencies will 'kick off,'
            JPMorgan analysts including Hong Kong-based Bert Gochet wrote in
            a report yesterday. 'Worries over China's tight liquidity
            stance generate downside risks to growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's money market rates jumped in December to a six-month high, raising concern that tighter
            lending conditions may
            slow the world's second-largest economy. The yen's 15 percent
            decline over the past year is fueling speculation that a cheaper
            currency may help Japanese companies grab export market share
            from its competitors in South Korea and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Philippine peso touched the weakest level since 2010
            yesterday on concern the Federal Reserve may accelerate the
            withdrawal of stimulus as the U.S. economy improves. The
            Malaysian ringgit posted its biggest two-day drop since
            November, while the South Korean won fell 1.3 percent from the
            five-year high set in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed started reducing its monthly bond purchases in
            January by $10 billion to $75 billion, reducing capital flows to
            emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has
            slid as much as 16 percent since May 22, when the Fed signaled
            its stimulus program could be trimmed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cash Squeeze &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's seven-day repurchase rate surged to 4.98 percent
            today in Shanghai, the highest level since Jan. 2, according to
            National Interbank Funding Center. New yuan loans slumped to a
            one-year low in December and money-supply growth eased, central
            bank data showed on Jan. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cash squeeze will persist this month because
            authorities are determined to curb shadow-banking financing and
            reduce banks' reliance on interbank funding amid concerns about
            delinquent loans, Haitong International Securities Co., part of
            China's second-largest brokerage, said in a Jan. 15 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen, which traded at 104.33 per dollar today, may yet
            reach 115 this year as the Bank of Japan weighs more stimulus to
            offset a sales-tax increase, former board member Nobuyuki
            Nakahara said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The World Bank on Jan. 14 raised its forecast for global
            growth to 3.2 percent this year, while lowering the estimates
            for China and other emerging-market economies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Purest Expression' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Based on conversations with customers, JPMorgan said local
            bond funds haven't received any inflows so far this year. It
            would be the first time that has happened in January since 2008,
            JPMorgan said, citing data from research company EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The analysts recommend selling the ringgit as the 'purest
            expression of positioning for a lack of EM local bond inflows.'
            Foreign investors held 45 percent of ringgit-denominated debt in
            November, the most among 10 developing countries, making
            Malaysia susceptible to capital outflows, according to Credit
            Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan advises further 'underweight' the Philippine
            peso, saying local interest rates are too low. Investors should
            also exit a bet that the South Korean won will rise as the yen
            weakens. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Tops Banks for Third Year as Loans Retreat: Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) led lending to
            commodities companies for a third consecutive year even as
            global financing to the industry fell to the lowest since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets arranged $44.1 billion of
            loans, giving the New York-based company a 7.8 percent market
            share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America
            Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C) came next. Three Canadian banks were in
            the top 10, from one a year ago, as European lenders retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loans fell 23 percent to $568 billion last year after
            mergers and acquisitions diminished to the lowest annual total
            since 2010. Deals accelerated in the fourth quarter to the
            highest in five years, including OAO Rosneft's $55 billion
            purchase of oil producer TNK-BP, as economic growth improved.
            Stock markets are rising for a third consecutive month after
            U.S. lawmakers reached a budget agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Since there hasn't been much MA for the past couple of
            years, there is some pent-up demand,' said Thomas Cassin, co-
            head of investment-grade finance at JPMorgan in New York.
            'Having more clarity around the fiscal cliff, the debt ceiling
            and just the direction of the economy in general will bring to
            bear a bit more confidence and willingness to go out and look at
            the MA.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Raw Materials &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities stagnated in 2012, with the Standard Poor's
            GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials rising 0.3 percent, the least in
            five years. The 140-member Bloomberg World Mining Index (BWMING) advanced
            2.9 percent, lagging behind the 13 percent gain in the MSCI All-
            Country World Index of equities. Natural-resource and energy
            companies announced $610 billion of mergers and acquisitions,
            8.3 percent less than in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets,
            arranged $30.8 billion of loans, and New York-based Citigroup
            $30.6 billion, giving them both a 5.4 percent market share.
            Combined lending by the top three banks fell 36 percent from a
            year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) overtook BNP Paribas SA (BNP) to take the
            fourth slot after buying $9.5 billion of the French bank's
            energy loans in February. The Paris-based lender retreated 10
            places in the rankings, as rival Societe Generale dropped to
            19th from 15th. The figures as of yesterday reflect transactions
            involving more than one bank and include credit lines, project
            or term loans and trade finance. Wells Fargo's total was $29.3
            billion in loans, for a 5.2 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Syndicated Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Declines in syndicated loans in the commodity and energy
            sector are consistent with trends in the broader market,' said
            Peter Hall, the global head of investment-grade loan syndicates
            at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London. 'The next big wave
            of refinancing is due in two years, so 2014 and 2015 are going
            to be much busier.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average interest banks charge for loans to commodity
            companies has risen to 325 basis points more than benchmark
            lending rates, from 268 basis points in 2011, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Globally across all industries, banks charged 323.4 basis
            points above lending rates compared with 282.3 basis points in
            2011. Syndicated loans across industries declined 21 percent to
            $2.99 trillion in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Canadian Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBC Capital Markets, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada (RY), led
            the advance by Canadian banks last year, taking fifth place with
            $28.4 billion of loans, little changed from a year earlier. TD
            Securities Inc., part of Toronto Dominion Bank, arranged almost
            $19.9 billion for seventh place, and was one of only two in the
            top 10 to increase overall lending, along with Barclays Plc. (BARC)
            Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS), based in Toronto, oversaw $16 billion of
            loans to take 10th place. Wells Fargo, Barclays, Nova Scotia and
            BNP Paribas declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Resource financing will go up this year,' said Burke Smyth, the co-head of Canadian credit
            origination at TD
            Securities in Toronto. 'There is nothing to prevent it from
            seeing an increase as commodity prices recover a bit, foreign
            companies start to look at Canada and the U.S. starts to grow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian banks have been ranked as the world's soundest for
            five consecutive years by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum.
            They are also buying more assets, including Bank of Nova
            Scotia's agreement in August to purchase ING Groep NV's Canadian
            unit for C$3.1 billion ($3.15 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'banks are playing off the strength of their balance
            sheets and expertise that we have in metals and mining,' said
            Mark Chandler, the head of Canadian syndicated and leveraged
            finance at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Canada is home to
            Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX), the largest gold miner, and Potash Corp. of
            Saskatchewan Inc., the biggest fertilizer producer. Commodities
            are about half of Canada's exports, government figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mergers Data &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Natural-resource and energy companies announced $202.8
            billion of mergers and acquisitions in the fourth quarter,
            accounting for 33 percent of the annual total, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. Rosneft raised $16.8 billion in loans last month
            to finance the TNK-BP acquisition, to become the world's largest
            publicly-traded crude-oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loans to commodity companies in North America declined 24
            percent to $317.9 billion while those in Europe, Middle East and
            Africa tumbled 31 percent to $140.9 billion, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. There was an 8.7 percent drop in the Central
            Asia and Pacific Rim region to $92.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Key Event' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A key event in 2012 was the return to stability of
            funding to the commodity finance market, even if the overall
            financing market volumes are down due to the pullback in metals
            prices and slower global economic growth,' said Federico Turegano, the global head of natural resources and
            energy
            finance at Societe Generale in Paris. 'The big question for
            2013 will be how fast the Asian markets return to purchasing
            commodities, particularly China on the metals side.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China is the biggest consumer of everything from copper to
            cotton to coal and it probably returned to faster economic
            growth in the final three months of 2012, having slowed for
            seven consecutive quarters, the mean of 35 economist estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg show. Chinese banks probably will lend
            more this year, with a focus on financing the nation's commodity
            cargoes, said Simon Tyler, the head of corporate banking at
            China Construction Bank Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Chinese banks are starting to compete more in the
            loans space,' he said. 'This year there will be much more. We
            are expanding from a relatively low base, so we are not going to
            be a major player yet but we will be doing a lot more.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Any return of funding won't be fully reflected in
            syndicated loans, said Turegano of Societe Generale. 'A huge
            part of the commodity finance business is done on an uncommitted
            bilateral basis, therefore undisclosed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Higher Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lending may increase this year should commodity costs
            rebound. A Bloomberg survey of 131 analysts, traders and
            investors last month predicted higher prices across industrial
            and precious metals and agriculture. Brent crude will trade
            above $100 a barrel for a third consecutive year, according to
            the median of 30 estimates compiled in December. It traded at
            $111.09 a barrel today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The world needs commodities,' said David Basra, the head
            of debt financing for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at
            Citigroup in London. 'We have a growing global population, we
            have growth in the emerging markets and that all puts demand on
            natural resources. The requirement for liquidity and funding
            remains high.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former JPMorgan Asia Head Said to Be Questioned by FBI</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gaby Abdelnour, a former JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) regional chief who expanded the bank's business in
            Asia, was questioned by U.S. investigators about his knowledge
            of a hiring program at the center of an international bribery
            probe, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abdelnour, who stepped down as head of JPMorgan's Asia-Pacific business in 2012 and later worked as
            a senior adviser at
            Bain Capital LLC, was met by FBI agents while traveling through
            a New York-area airport late last year and then interviewed,
            said the person, asking not to be named because the probe isn't
            public. Abdelnour and the bank haven't been accused of
            wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The meeting with a former JPMorgan executive shows how a
            probe of the firm's hiring practices has escalated since the
            bank said in August the Securities and Exchange Commission had
            sought information on its employment of certain people in Hong
            Kong and client relationships. Authorities are examining whether
            JPMorgan hired people in Asia so that their relatives in
            government would steer business to the firm, people with
            knowledge with the investigations have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abdelnour didn't respond to messages left at his home in
            Manhattan. Several past and present JPMorgan employees in Hong
            Kong have retained attorneys, mainly paid for by the bank, one
            of the people familiar with the inquiry said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Santander Mexico Plunges After JPMorgan Cut: Mexico City Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico
            SAB (SANMEXB), the Mexican unit of Spain's biggest bank, had its biggest
            two-day slide in three months after JPMorgan Chase Co. said
            earnings growth is slowing and cut its rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares have tumbled 9.4 percent in the past two days to
            40.19 pesos at 1:11 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest in a month.
            The stock is down 11 percent from a record 45.15 on Jan 14.
            Santander Mexico fell 3.8 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analyst Saul Martinez wrote in a Jan. 16 report
            that he expects the Mexico City-based company's earnings growth
            to slow 'to the single-digit range as cost pressure mounts and,
            eventually, tax rates rise.' He cut his rating on the stock to
            the equivalent of sell from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some investors took the JPMorgan report as a signal to
            lock-in gains, according to Martin Lara, a Mexico City-based
            analyst with Corp. Actinver SAB, who has a hold recommendation
            on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That was an excuse for everybody to take profits,' Lara
            said in a telephone interview. 'If it continues to fall it's a
            good long-term investment opportunity.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Start Electronic Corporate Bond Trading System</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, plans to consolidate its electronic trading
            system for corporate bonds with other asset classes in the early
            part of this year as lenders seek to adapt to regulatory changes
            and reduce costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're trying to figure out how our customers would like
            to execute,' Scott Wacker, the London-based head of FX Sales
            EMEA at JPMorgan, said today in a telephone interview. 'Our
            target is the end of the first quarter, maybe into the second
            quarter that we intend to start to offer the ability to execute
            online for fixed-income products.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the most-active underwriter of dollar-denominated
            debt, is beginning the effort as Wall Street's biggest banks
            have pared their corporate-bond inventories by 76 percent since
            the 2007 peak with new risk-curbing regulations forcing them to
            reduce their roles as market makers. Firms are capitulating to
            the growing use of electronic systems to broker bonds that
            traditionally were bought and sold over the counter with traders
            as middlemen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clients are already using the web-based platform, JP Morgan
            Markets, for purposes including trading currencies and commodity
            futures and accessing research, according to Wacker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank by
            assets, announced the start of an electronic bond-trading
            service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. spent a year developing an
            electronic trading system for corporate bonds called GSessions
            that started operating in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The profitability of Wall Street firms is being challenged
            by regulations requiring that they hold more capital as a buffer
            against potential losses from assets such as corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holdings of company debt at the 21 primary dealers that
            trade with the Federal Reserve shrank 74 percent to $56.4
            billion as of Jan. 9 from the end of 2007, according to the
            Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Bond Reduces Whale to Teapot Tempest: Corporate Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $6.2 billion
            trading loss last year is little more than a fading memory for
            bondholders who awarded the lender its cheapest U.S. borrowing
            costs ever at a debt sale yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank by assets sold $6 billion of
            securities, including $2.75 billion of 10-year notes with an
            unprecedented 3.2 percent coupon, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The extra yield investors demanded to hold those
            securities rather than government debt was 56 basis points
            tighter than where average comparable JPMorgan spreads traded
            before the scandal came to light in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's bond offering came a day after it reported a
            record profit for the third straight year even after posting the
            trading gaffe at the hands of an employee known as the London
            Whale. Aided by rising loan demand in a recovering economy, the
            New York-based bank boosted mortgage fees and related revenue
            almost threefold to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter. The
            trading losses are close to being a 'non-issue' Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Having the capacity to brush away a whale-sized problem
            and still be able to generate such significant earnings should
            make a bondholder sleep well at night,' Joel Levington,
            managing director of corporate credit for Brookfield Investment
            Management Inc. in New York, which manages $150 billion, said in
            an e-mail. The lender 'should generate north of $21 billion in
            profit annually for the next few years. That profile is highly
            unlikely to experience near-term default concerns.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Coupon &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's three-part debt sale was its biggest in the U.S.
            since the lender issued $7.2 billion of bonds in April 2011,
            Bloomberg data show. The bank sold $1.25 billion of five-year
            notes at its record low coupon of 1.8 percent to yield 103 basis
            points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, and $2 billion of
            five-year, floating-rate bonds at 90 basis points more than the
            London interbank offered rate. The 10-year portion had a spread
            of 133 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average spreads on 10-year, A rated JPMorgan bonds plunged
            to 140 basis points Jan. 16, down from 243 basis points on May
            18, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data, a
            week after Fitch Ratings cut the bank's debt as a result of the
            trading loss. That compares with 189 basis points on March 26,
            before reports of the credit-derivative trades surfaced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in New York,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Solid Position' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank earned $21.3 billion in net income last year on
            improving credit quality, according to Kathleen Shanley, a bond
            analyst at New York-based researcher Gimme Credit LLC. A
            provision for credit losses declined by more than half to $3.4
            billion from $7.6 billion in 2011, Shanley wrote yesterday in a
            report. It's the third straight year the lender has earned at
            least $15 billion in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They continue to be a very solid position for a lot of
            fixed-income investors,' Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond
            strategy at Susquehanna International Group LLP, said in a
            telephone interview from New York. 'They continue to perform
            extremely well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan first disclosed the trading losses on May 10,
            after Dimon initially dismissed concern as a 'tempest in a
            teapot' the month before. London-based trader Bruno Iksil, who
            worked in the chief investment office, built up positions in
            credit derivatives so large he was nicknamed the London Whale.
            The bank released a 129-page report Jan. 16 that blamed managers
            for roles in failing to halt the loss, as well as an 'error
            prone' risk-modeling system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's shares fell 9.3 percent May 11, the biggest drop
            in nine months, after JPMorgan estimated its trading losses at
            $2 billion. Fitch reduced the firm's long-term default rating to
            A+ from AA- the same day, following the close of trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost to protect JPMorgan debt from losses for five
            years climbed 21 basis points to 132.5 basis points after the
            disclosure, Bloomberg prices show. Those credit-default swaps
            traded at 78.5 basis points at 11:26 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CDS prices typically fall when investor confidence improves
            and rise when it deteriorates. A basis point equals $1,000
            annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're five years on from the beginning of the financial
            crisis and investors have now recognized that many banks have
            increased their capital dramatically, non-performing loans have
            come down or their asset quality has improved dramatically,'
            Pinto said. 'They're much more comfortable investing today in
            bank paper.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank Spreads &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender set aside $656 million in provisions against
            future mortgage loan losses, compared with an average estimate
            by analysts of about $1.5 billion, according to a Jan. 16
            earnings statement. Mortgage fees and related revenue increased
            to $2.03 billion in the fourth quarter from $723 million a year
            earlier as the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent, indicating
            a strengthening economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gap between spreads on investment-grade bank bonds and
            the broader high-grade market reached the narrowest level in
            more than five years, when relative yields on bank debt dropped
            to 154 basis points, or 9 basis points more than corporates, on
            Jan. 7, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everything is driven by what the Fed is doing,' said Pri de Silva, a bank analyst at New
            York-based CreditSights Inc.,
            'Banks are opportunistically locking in the lower rates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve has held interest rates near
            record lows for an unprecedented fifth straight year, pushing
            investors to riskier assets in the search for yield. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The CIO fiasco blemished JPMorgan's previously stellar
            reputation as a savvy risk control manager,' wrote Gimme
            Credit's Shanley, who rates the bank's debt a buy. 'Jamie Dimon
            is no doubt glad to bid farewell to the year of the London
            Whale.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>ONO Is Said to Consider Picking JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Grupo Corporativo ONO SA is close to
            hiring banks for an initial public offering, according to two
            people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Spanish cable operator may pick Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) in the coming weeks for the IPO after
            inviting banks to bid for the work, the people said, asking not
            to be identified before a final decision is made. Madrid-based
            ONO held talks with investment banks in December and could sell
            shares this year if it decides to proceed, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The broadband provider could be valued at about 6.4 billion
            euros ($8.7 billion) in an IPO including debt, or 8.5 times its
            2012 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
            amortization, said Francisco Salvador, a Madrid-based strategist
            at FGA/MG Valores. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ONO's Ebitda in 2012 rose 0.5 percent to 752 million euros,
            a company statement showed. ONO had about 1.9 million
            residential customers and 118,000 small-office and home-office
            clients at the end of September. Its net debt at the time was
            3.3 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Apart from its big debt level, its main handicap is that
            the company hasn't been able to grow as fast as its peers while
            the broadband market in Spain is becoming more and more
            competitive,' Salvador said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Telefonica, Jazztel &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ONO's 11.125 percent bonds maturing in July 2019 rose 0.9
            cents on the euro this month to a record high 110.9 cents as of
            5 p.m. yesterday in Madrid, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Rosalia Portela said at an industry
            conference in the northern Spanish city of Santander in
            September that an IPO was 'a priority, our goal, and we expect
            to be able to carry it out in the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ONO has faced increasing price competition from rivals such
            as Telefonica SA (TEF), Spain's biggest phone company, and Jazztel
            Plc. The company's third-quarter Ebitda fell 9.3 percent from a
            year earlier to 172 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among ONO's shareholders, representatives for Thomas H. Lee
            Partners, Providence Equity Partners Inc. and CCMP Capital LLC
            didn't comment. Representatives for JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and
            ONO also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There has been speculation that ONO may be a takeover
            target for Newbury, England-based mobile-phone operator Vodafone
            Group Plc (VOD) as Europe's telecommunications industry undergoes a
            wave of mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says BVG Owes $200 Million Over 'Unfortunate' CDS</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said Berlin's
            public transport provider only has itself to blame for signing
            an 'unfortunate' derivatives contract that led to $200 million
            in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's lawyer, Laurence Rabinowitz, told a London court
            on the first day of a trial that the timing of Berliner
            Verkehrsbetriebe's 2007 credit-default swap 'could hardly have
            been worse' because it coincided with the start of the global
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Rather than simply accepting that it had been
            unfortunate,' Rabinowitz said today that BVG 'cast around for
            someone other than itself to blame.' JPMorgan sued the
            transport organization to recover $204 million plus interest it
            says it is owed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BVG, which has run the German capital's trains and buses
            for more than 80 years, argues it wasn't sophisticated enough to
            understand the transaction and was misled by JPMorgan and the
            bank's law firm, Clifford Chance LLP. The owner of OK! Magazine,
            dentists and elderly care homes have sued lenders over the sale
            of derivatives they say they didn't need or fully comprehend. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
            to comment. BVG didn't immediately respond to e-mails seeking
            comment. Anna Ward, a spokeswoman for London-based Clifford
            Chance, said the law firm should never have been sued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the claims against us are misconceived and
            entirely without merit and we will continue to defend our
            position robustly,' Ward said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;0.19 Percent &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The chance of any defaults in the underlying portfolio for
            the swap were 0.19 percent when it was signed, Rabinowitz said.
            One of the companies linked to the transaction was Lehman
            Brothers Holdings Inc., which collapsed in 2008, sparking
            turmoil in the markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Taking on a small risk, even vanishingly small, isn't the
            same thing as taking on no risk at all,' Rabinowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps are agreements for one party to pay
            another if a target goes bankrupt or fails to pay its debts. The
            product can be used as a type of insurance, or to speculate on
            the credit-worthiness of companies or assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan staff 'shut their eyes' to the fact that BVG had
            misunderstood the 'complex credit derivative' it was signing,
            the transport body said in legal documents. Bank employees knew
            BVG had no experience in this type of transaction, and gave a
            misleading presentation about its risks, according to the
            documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Let Down' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BVG was badly let down by Clifford Chance,' which had a
            conflict of interest because it simultaneously advised both
            JPMorgan and the BVG, the German company said in the documents.
            The law firm should have turned down the work, or ceased to act,
            because of the risk of a conflict of interest, BVG said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fought for three years to have the case heard in
            the U.K., with the European Court of Justice ruling in its favor
            in 2011. BVG had sought a trial in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trial is scheduled to last for 10 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is: JPMorgan Chase Bank Anr v Berliner
            Verkehrsbetriebe, High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division
            Commercial Court: 08-1052 &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Courboin France Head, Seillier EU FIG Chief</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, named Kyril Courboin head of France,
            replacing Isabelle Seillier, who is becoming head of the firm's
            financial institutions group for Europe, the Middle East and
            Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Courboin, who joined JPMorgan in 1990 and currently heads
            the financial institutions team in Europe, will report jointly
            to Emilio Saracho, deputy chief executive officer of EMEA, and
            Viswas Raghavan, head of banking for the region, according to an
            internal memorandum to employees. The contents of the document
            were confirmed by a spokeswoman for the lender today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seillier, who joined the firm in 1993 and has been in
            charge of France since 2008, will be responsible for covering
            banks and other clients in the financial-services industry in
            the region. She will report to Raghavan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan combined its investment bank with the firm's
            corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units last
            year, and named Raghavan head of banking for Europe as part of a
            revamp. Fourth-quarter revenue at the newly combined corporate
            and investment bank rose 21 percent to $7.6 billion, New York-
            based JPMorgan said last week, the first time it reported
            results of the entire group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Courboin's 'knowledge of the financial sector is second to
            none, and his international profile will help further develop
            our business in France,' Raghavan said. 'Isabelle has
            positioned JPMorgan as a top international bank in France, which
            will prove invaluable in her new regional role.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Courboin has worked on deals including Credit Agricole SA's
            2003 acquisition of Credit Lyonnais and the privatization of
            Credit Industriel et Commercial. Seillier served as head of
            investment banking activities for France from 2005 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Bridgepoint Advisers Ltd., a U.K.
            private-equity firm with more than $12 billion in committed
            funds, will choose JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to consider Swedish
            renal-care provider Diaverum's future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bridgepoint 'is close' to completing JPMorgan's
            appointment to look at strategic options for Lund-based Diaverum
            for the next 12 months, James Murray, a spokesman for the firm,
            said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Diaverum provides renal care to more than 20,000 patients
            at about 250 clinics in 17 countries, including in South
            America, Australia, Europe and the Middle East, according to
            information on its website. The company employs 6,900 people and
            reported sales of 398 million euros ($530 million) in 2011.
            Companies owned by London-based Bridgepoint employ 72,000 people

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. are among the banks shortlisted to help India sell part of
            its stake in Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB), four people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JM Financial Ltd. (JM) was also among the preferred investment
            banks that may be hired to manage the share sale of the
            country's third-largest private-sector lender by assets, said
            the people, asking not to be identified before a public
            announcement. The government will sell about half of its 20.7
            percent stake in the bank, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale valued at 57 billion rupees ($927 million) is part
            of India's efforts to narrow its budget gap and prevent a
            sovereign credit-rating downgrade to so-called junk status.
            Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government has raised 13 percent
            of the targeted 400 billion rupees it planned to raise by March
            31, according to the Disinvestment Department's data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will get a fee of one rupee for managing the
            issue while the expenses will be paid by the government, the
            people said. The share sale will probably happen before mid-February, two people said. Finance ministry
            spokesman D.S. Malik
            wasn't available for comment when called in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said in
            December the government is considering selling its stake in Axis
            Bank, which is held by the Specified Undertaking of the Unit
            Trust of India, or SUUTI, a state-run asset manager that also
            owns stakes in Larsen Toubro Ltd. and ITC Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government plans to sell its 171.9-billion rupee stake
            in billionaire Anil Agarwal-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd., according
            to Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) quit working on
            Tianhe Chemicals Group's planned $1 billion initial public
            offering in Hong Kong amid a U.S. probe into hiring practices,
            two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank gave up the mandate as questions arose over
            Joyce Wei, a former employee, whose father is Tianhe Chemicals
            Chairman Qi Wei, the people said, asking not to be identified
            because the information is private. UBS AG (UBSN), which is also
            advising on the IPO, hired Wei toward the end of last year, two
            people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether New York-based
            JPMorgan hired people in Asia so that their relatives in
            government would steer business to the firm, people with
            knowledge with the investigations have said. Gaby Abdelnour,
            former head of the bank's Asia-Pacific business, was questioned
            by U.S. investigators about his knowledge of the hiring
            practices, a person briefed on the matter said last week.
            Abdelnour and the bank haven't been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investment banks are super cautious at the moment,'
            Philippe Espinasse, a former head of equity capital markets for
            Asia at Nomura Holdings Inc. and author of 'IPO: a Global
            Guide,' said by phone from Hong Kong today. 'They might have
            quite a bit to lose by staying on the deal if there were a
            direct link between the company's senior management and someone
            they employ.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will join Royal
            Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce leading
            the debt sale to finance a C$8.5 billion Alberta oil refinery
            that has the backing of the provincial government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will work as joint-lead underwriters for bonds to
            finance the Sturgeon upgrader and refinery in Redwater, Alberta,
            Ian MacGregor, chairman of North West Upgrading Inc., one of the
            partners in the joint venture, said through spokeswoman Shauna
            MacDonald. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The project is expected to be 80 percent financed by debt
            with the rest coming from equity, so long as the project
            maintains an investment grade credit rating, North West said in
            a Dec. 4 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has incurred C$1.5 billion of the project's
            cost and the Alberta government and the other partner in the
            venture, Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ), have committed to
            further financing through the purchase of C$600 million of
            subordinated debt, North West said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alberta's government, which has the top AAA rating from
            Moody's Investors Service, Standard Poor's and DBRS,
            has agreed to pay down three-quarters of the debt over 30 years
            through the processing fees it will pay the refinery to process
            the bitumen the government already receives as royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government is expected to supply 75 percent of the
            bitumen to the project. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The project is expected to commence operations in September
            2017, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toronto-Dominion Bank won top spot among underwriters of
            Canadian government debt last year after it managed the sale of
            the largest provincial bond ever: C$5 billion of debt to fund a
            hydroelectric project in Newfoundland and Labrador, which itself
            won a loan guarantee from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBC was the top underwriter of corporate debt in Canada
            last year with CIBC coming in third and JPMorgan in 16th place,
            according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When SurveyMonkey Inc. Chief Executive Officer Dave Goldberg wanted to buy out investors from his
            Internet company and attract new ones who wouldn't balk at his aim to stay private, he steered clear of
            traditional startup financiers in the venture-capital community. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, Goldberg
            turned to an entirely different adviser: JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jimmy Lee, vice
            chairman of the investment bank who normally works on multibillion dollar deals, traveled from New York to
            SurveyMonkey's headquarters in Palo Alto, California, to brainstorm Goldberg's options. Goldberg later hired
            JPMorgan to lead a $350 million syndicated loan for the online survey provider as part of an $800 million
            recapitalization the closely held company completed last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Considering what a small
            company we are, SurveyMonkey isn't something Jimmy would usually spend time on,' Goldberg, who is married to
            Facebook Inc. (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, said in an interview. The recapitalization,
            which also involved selling $444 million in equity to Goldberg, Tiger Global Management LLC and Google Inc.
            (GOOG), valued SurveyMonkey at $1.35 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street investment banks -- from
            JPMorgan to Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) -- are increasingly catering to closely
            held technology startups, especially in Silicon Valley. While firms led by Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) have long cultivated relationships with venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to later
            earn fees managing initial public offerings and advising on acquisitions, many banks have expanded the
            roster of services in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has named
            former UBS AG (UBSN) banker Hussein Hassan to head global Islamic
            finance as the biggest U.S. lender strives to boost its share of
            an industry whose assets are set to double by 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
            of Islamic structuring for UBS, would focus on clients in
            countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
            e-mailed statement today. Malaysia hosts the world's biggest
            market for Islamic bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts
            the world's biggest share of Shariah-compliant assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As we have observed a significant increase in the demand
            for Shariah-compliant banking products, we have decided to
            invest in high-caliber people, systems and technology,' Sjoerd Leenart, JPMorgan's senior country officer
            for the Middle East
            and North Africa, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global banks including HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Standard
            Chartered Plc have set up Islamic banking units to take
            advantage of growing demand for financial products that comply
            with the religion's ban on interest. Global Islamic financial
            assets are set to double to as much as $3 trillion by 2015,
            according to Standards Poor's estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Islamic Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hassan, who also headed Zurich-based UBS' Middle East and
            North Africa structuring, will be based in Dubai, a Persian Gulf
            emirate striving create a hub for Shariah-compliant banking that
            would take on such centers as Malaysia and Bahrain. He will lead
            JPMorgan's effort to 'further build out its Islamic offering
            across different lines of business and regions,' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global sales of Islamic bonds surged 26 percent last year
            to $46 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuers
            in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi
            Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, accounted for almost half
            of the total after sukuk sales tripled and borrowing costs
            plunged to records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan helped arrange $119 million of global sukuk sales
            last year, or 0.3 percent of the total, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. That compares with $11 billion, or almost a
            quarter of the total, for HSBC, the world's top underwriter of
            Islamic bonds. Dubai, which is home to the world's tallest
            skyscraper, plans to sell 10-year dollar-denominated sukuk
            today, four people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yen May Rally to 2-Week High, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The yen may strengthen to a two-week
            high versus the dollar based on resistance levels before Japan's
            currency resumes a bearish path, according to JPMorgan Chase
            Co., citing trading patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The dollar/yen can correct a bit more over the short term
            and retrace into the 87.80/86.80 yen zone,' Niall O'Connor, a
            technical analyst at JPMorgan Securities, wrote in an e-mail.
            During the next two months, O'Connor predicted the yen will
            weaken to around 92.25, the lowest level since June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen rose to 88.54 per dollar at 11 a.m. New York time.
            It has weakened against the dollar for 13 of the past 14 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currency may reach 86.80 yen, a level last reached on
            Jan. 3, after the Bank of Japan under outgoing Governor Masaaki
            Shirakawa said it will buy 13 trillion yen ($146.6 billion) in
            assets from January 2014 and target a 2 percent inflation rate,
            O'Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The medium-term JPY underperformance trade does not seem
            complete, and corrective retracements are still viewed as
            opportunities to sell JPY,' O'Connor wrote in a note to
            clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
            of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
            commodity, currency or index. Resistance is an area on a price
            graph where technical analysts anticipate sell orders to be
            clustered. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MGM China Leads Macau Casino Slump on JPMorgan Downgrade</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) fell the
            most in seven months, leading declines among Macau casinos after
            JPMorgan Chase Co. cut its rating to neutral and recommended
            investors trim holdings of rival operators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The operator controlled by MGM Resorts International (MGM)
            declined 6.6 percent, the most since June 11, to HK$32.65 at the
            close in Hong Kong trading. Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. fell
            5.5 percent to HK$76.95. Sands China Ltd. (1928) and SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)
            dropped 4.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the sector is at risk of entering a period
            where there is more room for downside rather than upside
            surprise,' Kenneth Fong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JP
            Morgan, wrote in a research note published today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market has already priced in a 'significant growth'
            assumption from the future projects while insufficient labor and
            gaming-table allocations may add risks, he said. The bank
            expects the industry's revenue growth to slow to 17 percent this
            year, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Casino revenue in Macau, the only place in China where
            casino gambling is legal, rose 19 percent to $45.2 billion last
            year, about seven times that of the Las Vegas Strip. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan in Court as Berlin Transport Disputes Deal Costs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) employees
            discussed why they shouldn't reveal to their client, Berlin's
            transport authority, what the bank stood to gain from a complex
            derivative deal that's now at the center of a U.K. court case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Phone transcripts cited by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe in a
            London trial show JPMorgan staff referring to Matthias Meier, an
            employee in the German company's finance department, before the
            2007 transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't want to show to Meier that we are making so much
            money on it right?' Johannes Banner, a JPMorgan salesman, asked
            a colleague in 2006, according to BVG's court documents. Another
            banker called Meier a 'pain in the a--e' and said they should
            'sting' him. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sued the firm, which operates Berlin's trains and
            buses, in 2008 for about $200 million it says it's owed from the
            credit-default swap transaction. The lender argues BVG was only
            a victim of bad luck and the deal turned costly because of
            unprecedented events in financial markets during 2008. The case
            went to trial in London this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tim Lord, a lawyer for BVG, told the court yesterday the
            transport authority had never properly understood the so-called
            'synthetic, single-tranche collateralized debt obligation' and
            was misled by JPMorgan and its lawyers at Clifford Chance LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is paying a
            lower relative cost to borrow than before the financial crisis
            even after ceding more than a year's profit to settle disputes
            linked to faulty mortgages and Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank borrowed $5.25 billion yesterday in
            an offering that included 10-year securities yielding 1.125
            percentage points more than Treasuries, the narrowest spread
            among similar JPMorgan notes since 2005. The measure, used to
            gauge creditworthiness, has contracted from 1.33 points a year
            ago and is the tightest among similar-maturity bonds of Wall
            Street competitors including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They still command some of the best rates among the big
            universal banks, by all means,' Chris Baker, a credit analyst
            at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's after spending more than $23 billion on legal
            settlements in 2013, which helped end a three-year streak of
            record annual earnings even as it led the world in corporate-bond underwriting for the sixth straight year.
            While litigation
            expenses may remain elevated in 2014, JPMorgan's earnings power
            means any legal issues should be manageable, according to
            Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The group, to be led by the director of the Division of

            topics such as consistency in compliance among market

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. quit working on Tianhe Chemicals
            Group's planned $1 billion initial public offering in Hong Kong
            amid a U.S. probe into hiring practices, two people with
            knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank stepped out as questions arose over Joyce
            Wei, a former employee, whose father is Tianhe Chemicals
            Chairman Qi Wei, the people said, asking not to be identified
            because the information is private. UBS AG (UBSN), which is also
            advising on the IPO, hired Wei toward the end of last year, two
            people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining whether JPMorgan hired
            people in Asia so that their relatives in government would steer
            business to the firm, people with knowledge with the

            &lt;p&gt;Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told McGraw
            Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) Chairman Harold W. McGraw III in an Aug. 8,
            2011 phone call that Standard Poor's downgrade of the U.S.
            debt would be met by a response and that the company would be
            held accountable, SP said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McGraw said the call occurred after SP was the only credit
            ratings company to downgrade the U.S. debt. The company claims
            the government sued in retaliation for the downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Government officials have said the downgrade was based on
            an error by SP. The Justice Department last year accused SP of
            lying about its ratings being free of conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
            Los Angeles, which brought the lawsuit, declined to comment on
            the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justice Department officials have previously said the
            lawsuit was unrelated to the downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;European Union rules to cap banker bonuses at twice fixed
            pay may be undermined by recommendations from the European
            Banking Authority that would create widespread waivers to the
            curbs, a European Parliament lawmaker said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU assembly last year clinched a deal on rules
            curtailing the bonus culture that lawmakers blamed for fueling
            the 2008 financial crisis. At least three parliament members
            have vowed to fight to keep the EBA from weakening the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Once a proposal is issued, lawmakers will have an objection

        <headline>U.K. Homebuilders Fall as JPMorgan Downgrades: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. homebuilders fell the most in
            four months after JPMorgan Chase Co. said a moderate housing
            market improvement is already accounted for in their share
            prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index (BEUHBLD) slumped by 2.6
            percent, the biggest drop since Sept. 26. Redrow Plc led the
            declines at 4.3 percent and Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV), the U.K.'s
            largest homebuilder by volume, fell 3.6 percent. Both were cut
            to underweight by analyst Emily Biddulph. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index, composed of the U.K.'s seven biggest publicly
            traded homebuilders, gained 70 percent last year as higher
            selling prices and improved margins helped overcome the
            country's stuttering economy and a lack of mortgage lending.
            While some economic indicators show signs of improvement, it's
            unclear how those will affect the market, Biddulph wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The sector is now pricing in a near-term meaningful
            improvement in housing market conditions,' Biddulph wrote in
            the note. 'Although we continue to see some medium-term value
            in the sector and see little risk to consensus earnings
            estimates, we see near-term risk to sentiment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bovis Homes Group Plc was also cut to underweight. Bellway
            Plc and Taylor Wimpey Plc were downgraded to neutral by the New
            York-based bank and Persimmon Plc was kept at neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Britain is facing the prospect of a triple-dip recession
            this year, hurting efforts by potential homebuyers to save for a
            deposit. Weekly pay growth slowed to an annual 1.5 percent in
            the three months through November, while pay increases excluding
            bonuses eased to 1.4 percent, the lowest since June 2010. That
            compares with an inflation rate of 2.7 percent in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taylor Wimpey remains Biddulph's preferred stock because of
            its valuation and its land for building, she said. Shares of the
            U.K.'s second-biggest homebuilder by volume fell 3.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rand Breach Points to Losses, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The rand may weaken to an almost
            four-year low versus the U.S. dollar as the South African
            currency breaches so-called resistance levels, according to
            JPMorgan Chase Co., citing technical trading patterns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The next big target is around 9.20, 50 percent
            retracement from the 2008 high,' Niall O'Connor, a technical
            analyst at JP Morgan Securities, wrote in an e-mail. 'The rand
            can maintain the underperformance bias, so upside risks for
            dollar/rand look to be intact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rand last touched 9.20 per dollar on April 15, 2009.
            The South African currency fell today to as low as 9.044, the
            least since April 22, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rand weakened beyond 9 per dollar for the first time in
            nine weeks as accelerating inflation added to concern about
            slowing growth amid labor protests and civil unrest in Africa's
            biggest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer inflation jumped to a seven-month high in
            December, reducing the central bank's room to stimulate the
            economy. Protests by township residents opposed to a government
            plan to redraw municipal boundaries in Sasolburg left two people
            dead yesterday, police spokesman Motantsi Makhele said. The riot
            comes a week after Anglo American Plc's platinum unit announced
            plans to fire workers amid labor unrest in the mining and
            agricultural industries. Africa's biggest economy has an
            unemployment rate of 25.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
            of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
            commodity, currency or index. Resistance is an area on a price
            graph where technical analysts anticipate sell orders to be

        <headline>JPMorgan, Westpac See RBA Cuts Delayed as Inflation Offsets Jobs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. and Westpac
            Banking Corp. pushed back their forecasts for when Australia's
            central bank will lower interest rates, with the strongest
            inflation in two years offsetting rising joblessness. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They join Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank of Canada,
            which shifted their predictions in the past three months. The
            estimates for delayed easing come as reports paint a mixed
            picture of the economy's transition to new growth sources amid
            the ebbing of a mining boom. Having priced in a 26 percent
            chance of a first-quarter rate cut after the weak jobs report on
            Jan. 16, swaps traders slashed the odds to 11 percent after Jan.
            22 data showed inflation was accelerating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are some fundamental problems in the economy,'
            said Stephen Walters, JPMorgan's chief economist in Australia,
            citing below-trend growth and rising unemployment in a phone
            interview yesterday. 'Yet, an inflation number like that makes
            it difficult for the Reserve Bank to do anything about those
            issues in the near term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A report this week showed the trimmed mean gauge of core
            prices unexpectedly rose 2.6 percent in the last three months of
            2013 from a year earlier, climbing above the mid-point of the
            central bank's target range and the strongest reading since
            2011. That followed data showing the worst annual drop in full-time jobs in more than two decades.
            Australia's Treasury
            predicts the unemployment rate will increase to 6 percent by
            July 1, the highest since 2003, from 5.8 percent in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pickup in the pace of consumer-price gains is 'almost
            exclusively' due to a decline in the Australian dollar last
            year, Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The acceleration will
            prove short-lived
            and policy rates will be cut once the data confirms this
            outlook, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Secondary Impact' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Weakness in domestic demand will contain the secondary
            impact on inflation from the weaker currency,' Evans wrote.
            'The Reserve Bank is likely to require convincing evidence of
            our assessment of inflation risks before it opts for lower
            interest rates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's cash rate stands at a record-low 2.5 percent.
            Westpac now sees it at 2 percent by the end of 2014, after two
            0.25 percentage point reductions in the second half. That
            compares with a previous call for cuts in the second and third
            quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America said in a Jan. 10 note that the RBA will
            trim its benchmark to 2.25 percent by mid-year, from an earlier
            prediction for February. RBC pushed its call for a quarter-point
            cut to the three months through June, from December 2013
            previously, according to an Oct. 14 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The median forecast of 29 economists is for the cash rate
            to remain unchanged through 2014, according to a Bloomberg News
            survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lower Aussie &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent this week to 87.68
            U.S. cents as of 9 a.m. in Sydney and yesterday touched 87.32,
            the lowest level since July 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Further declines may be limited by prospects inflation
            pressures will keep the central bank from lowering its key rate
            further after slashing it 2.25 percentage points over two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The RBA has indicated it would prefer a lower exchange rate
            to stimulate the economy. Governor Glenn Stevens said last month
            in an Australian Financial Review interview that a level of 85
            U.S. cents would be 'closer to the mark.' The Aussie won't
            fall to that level until the final quarter of this year,
            according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers will probably keep trying to verbally drive
            the local currency lower, according to JPMorgan's Walters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even so, 'it's very difficult, seemingly, for the Aussie
            to break meaningfully to the downside,' said Walters, who sees
            the currency at 87 by Dec. 31. 'The onus is going to be on the
            cash rate to do the work.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hard-to-Sell Junk Debt Lures Oaktree to JPMorgan: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bond investors are losing their
            aversion to difficult-to-trade corporate debt that handed them
            some of the biggest losses in the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield note buyers demand to own older, smaller
            junk bonds that trade infrequently has shrunk to an average 0.25
            percentage point this month from more than 1 percentage point a
            year ago, according to Barclays Plc data. JPMorgan Chase Co.
            money manager Jim Shanahan said he's preferring 'good credit
            quality and less liquidity' when picking bonds, while Howard Marks, the head of distressed debt investor
            Oaktree Capital
            Group LLC (OAK), said he's finding bigger potential gains in private,
            less-traded debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The evaporating premium for illiquid assets is showing the
            depths to which money managers are reaching to boost returns
            after a five-year rally that pushed relative yields on junk
            bonds to the least since August 2007. With Federal Reserve
            monetary policies suppressing interest-rate benchmarks for a
            sixth year, credit buyers are showing more concern that they'll
            miss out on a continued rally than get stuck with debt that lost
            26 percent during the market seizure in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For the past several years, people have been concerned
            about liquidity,' said Eric Gross, a credit strategist at
            Barclays in New York. 'Now we're hearing more about people
            seeking out illiquid bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fragile Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Such debt tends to be more vulnerable to price swings when
            market sentiment deteriorates, because there are fewer buyers to
            bid on it when investor withdrawals force money managers to
            sell. Those risks intensified after stricter banking rules
            accelerated a pullback by Wall Street dealers that used their
            own money to facilitate trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed cut their
            holdings of corporate bonds by 76 percent to $56 billion after
            peaking at $235 billion in 2007, Fed data through March show.
            After the central bank changed the way it reported the holdings
            in April, net speculative-grade bond holdings fell as much as 24
            percent to a low of $5.63 billion in May before rising to $7.7
            billion on Jan. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are demanding an average yield of 5.94 percent to
            own bonds sold at least 18 months ago in batches of less than
            $250 million, Barclays data show. That compares with an average
            5.7 percent for newer debt offerings of at least $500 million.
            The gap, which averaged 0.5 percentage point last year and 0.92
            percentage point in 2012, reached as much as 1.95 percentage
            points at the peak of the financial crisis in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Classic' Cycle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on MGM Resort International's $238 million of
            6.875 percent notes, which were issued in 2006 and mature in
            April 2016, has dropped 2.4 percentage points during the past
            year to 1.85 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
            reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
            That compares with a decline of 0.5 percentage point to 5.4
            percent on the casino owner's $1.25 billion offering of nine-year, 6.625 percent securities in December
            2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As people continue to look for yield and performance,
            they're willing to move into less-liquid areas of the market,'
            said Shanahan, who manages high-yield credit investments for
            JPMorgan's $1.5 trillion asset management unit. 'You're seeing
            a classic market cycle of people looking for pockets of value.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Intoxicating Brew' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With corporate borrowers selling record volumes of debt to
            lock in all-time low yields amid global central bank stimulus,
            'there is a tremendous and potentially unsustainable amount of
            paper in investors' hands, and this harsh reality is causing
            much angst,' according to a McKinsey Co. and Greenwich
            Associates report in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher, a
            former managing partner of a fund that bought distressed debt,
            said in a speech last week that he'd 'have to hire Sherlock
            Holmes to find a single distressed company priced attractively
            enough to buy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five years after the Fed started holding benchmark rates at
            about zero and pumping more than $3 trillion into the financial
            system to ignite growth, Fisher warned in the Jan. 14 remarks to
            the National Association of Corporate Directors that signs are
            emerging that Fed stimulus has made for 'an intoxicating
            brew.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even as the central bank starts slowing monthly bond
            purchases to $75 billion from $85 billion, yields on dollar-denominated speculative-grade bonds have fallen
            to 6.21 percent,
            0.22 percentage point from the record low in May 2013, according
            to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, which provide bigger cushions of extra
            yield over benchmark rates than higher-rated debt, are governed
            by idiosyncratic deal documents and aren't as frequently traded.
            While trading in speculative-grade bonds has risen, volumes have
            failed to keep pace with a market that's expanded 71 percent
            since 2008 as Wall Street's biggest banks reduce their holdings
            of riskier assets in the face of new regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by
            Moody's Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard
            Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are emboldened by a U.S. economy that will
            probably expand by 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent in 2015
            from 1.9 percent in last year, according to a Bloomberg survey
            of 83 economists. High-yield bond funds have received $3.85
            billion of deposits since the end of September, according to
            data compiled by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, as investors
            gained conviction that the U.S. economic recovery was
            strengthening. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent by
            Dec. 31 from 10 percent in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Homework &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Money has found it very easy to flow into public,
            mainstream things,' said Marks, Oaktree's chairman, in a Dec.
            10 presentation for investors. 'The best credit opportunities
            are in niche markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said the firm is earning about 11.5 percent to extend
            loans to smaller companies, about twice as much as the yield on
            a junk bond of comparable quality. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These deals are small and 'entirely illiquid,' he said.
            'It requires a lot of due diligence.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Publicly traded business-development corporations, which
            lend to the smallest and riskiest companies, attracted $4.1
            billion last year, the most since 2007, as the firms known as
            BDCs gained an average 16.4 percent. The firms are juicing
            returns by borrowing about 50 cents for every dollar raised from
            equity investors, up from 36 cents in 2011, according to data
            compiled by Keefe, Bruyette Woods analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Filling Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BDCs and other alternative asset managers that lend to
            small and mid-sized companies are filling a role traditionally
            dominated by banks, J.P. Morgan Asset Management's Shanahan said
            in a telephone interview. Holding smaller, less-traded
            securities can boost investor returns while maintaining a higher
            level of credit quality, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Credit is good and likely to be good over the horizon,'
            he said. 'People become less concerned about liquidity as
            you're less likely to need it in the near term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect against
            losses on U.S. and European corporate bonds jumped to the
            highest in five weeks. La Banque Postale SA is turning to the
            covered bond market to fund its mortgage business that has grown
            by about 50 percent over the past four years and can no longer
            be financed solely by customer deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Credit Benchmarks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
            to speculate on creditworthiness, rose 1.5 basis points to 67
            basis points as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to prices
            compiled by Bloomberg. In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index
            of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings increased 2.6 to
            75.2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both gauges, which typically rise as investor confidence
            deteriorates and fall as it improves, are trading at the highest
            intraday levels since Dec. 19. Credit swaps pay the buyer face
            value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
            value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
            annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banking unit of France's postal service, which has a
            home loan portfolio of 50 billion euros ($67.8 billion), will
            now fund 20 percent of that business with covered securities,
            according to Stephane Magnan, head of asset and liability
            management at the bank in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender is now the sixth-biggest mortgage lender in
            France, having taken market share from Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and
            BNP Paribas SA, according to SP. The bank's business expanded
            even as France's economy struggles to grow after exiting
            recession last year and unemployment touches a 16-year high. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s chief equity
            strategist in Tokyo, Hajime Kitano, will resign the investment
            bank, he wrote in an e-mail to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;

            by Institutional Investor magazine, falling from the top spot he
            held the previous year. JPMorgan spokeswoman Yukako Yoshino
            declined to comment. Kitano was not immediately available when
            called. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Kitano had deep insights, and he was popular with his
            analysis,' said Koji Toda, chief fund manager at Tokyo-based

            last year, bringing his pay closer to where it stood before he was penalized for faulty oversight of botched
            derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board's compensation package for Dimon, 57, who also serves as
            chairman, included $18.5 million in restricted stock, the New York-based lender said today in a regulatory
            filing. His salary was unchanged at $1.5 million and he got no cash bonus, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Board members decided to keep Dimon's pay below previous peak levels after criminal and regulatory
            probes cost JPMorgan more than $23 billion in settlements during 2013. The directors cut his 2012 package in
            half last January to $11.5 million, saying he bore 'ultimate responsibility' for failures that led to
            derivatives trading losses in the London Whale episode. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In raising Dimon's pay, the
            board of directors cited 'sustained long-term performance; gains in market share and customer satisfaction;
            and the regulatory issues the company has faced and the steps the company has taken to resolve those
            issues,' according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The restricted stock vests 50 percent after two years
            and 50 percent after three years, the bank said. Awarding Dimon's total bonus in shares ties his pay 'to the
            company's future performance, including continued progress on the company's regulatory agenda,' the firm
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Performance Priority &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board's compensation committee is
            led by Lee Raymond, 75, Exxon Mobil Corp.'s former chairman and CEO. JPMorgan's stock climbed 33 percent
            last year, matching the 81-company Standard Poor's 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Obviously they
            paid more attention to the operational performance and stock-price performance and less to the litigation
            issues,' said Joseph Sorrentino, a managing director at Steven Hall Partners, a New York-based compensation
            consulting firm. 'Maybe there's an argument that settling those items at those levels and removing the
            uncertainty there, maybe that's worth something as well, but hard to know.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief
            Financial Officer Marianne Lake, 44, received 80,346 shares, worth $4.65 million at the price of $57.875,
            the level at which Dimon's shares were valued. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, 43, received stock valued
            at $9.75 million, as did Mike Cavanagh, 48, co-head of the firm's corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Support &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, 51, the other co-head, received the same
            total pay as Cavanagh, and it was structured differently because of compensation rules in the U.K. where
            Pinto is based, according to a person briefed on the awards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any cash awards for named
            executives will be disclosed in the firm's proxy statement later this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon became
            CEO at the end of 2005 and added the title of chairman a year later. His reputation as a top manager, along
            with his pay, has fluctuated since then. While JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as the only large
            U.S. bank to avoid quarterly losses, the trading debacle in 2012 prompted some investors to call for
            splitting his dual roles. Shareholders rejected that proposal at a meeting in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon
            was paid $49.9 million for 2007, including special stock awards. During the financial crisis a year later,
            he took only a $1 million salary. He got $15.2 million for 2009, and $23 million for each of the two years
            that followed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Settlement Costs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In last year's third quarter, the
            bank posted its first loss on Dimon's watch after taking a $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting
            litigation and regulatory probes. The deficit ended the firm's streak of three record annual profits.
            Full-year net income fell 16 percent to $17.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon pushed last year to resolve
            government investigations, including at least eight Justice Department probes listed in the firm's quarterly
            report in October. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Settlements since then have included a record $13 billion deal to
            resolve inquiries into mortgage-bond sales. The bank paid $2.6 billion and avoided criminal prosecution
            while settling claims it failed to stop Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. The firm also paid more than $1
            billion last year tied to the botched derivatives bets, which lost more than $6.2 billion in 2012. In that
            case, U.S. and U.K. regulators faulted its oversight of a trader known as the London Whale because his
            positions were so large. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon told journalists earlier this month that he couldn't
            predict whether he might be able to put the legal disputes behind the bank this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Favored by Top Fund Looking Overseas: Australia Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AMP Capital Australian Corporate
            Bond Fund (AMPACBA), which outperformed its peers over the past decade,
            prefers U.S. and European banks to the South Pacific nation's
            lenders on improving economic prospects in those two regions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), 2013's best-performing corporate
            bond, is the fund's biggest holding, the AMP website shows. BNP
            Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase Co. are among the top 10, which
            include Westpac Banking Corp. as the only Australia-based
            lender. The AMP fund returned 6.2 percent in 2013, beating 21 of
            its peers, according to Morningstar Australia Pty. It topped the
            ranks of funds that invest mainly in Australian bonds over the
            past decade with an average return of 7.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's growth will trail the U.S. for the first time
            in four years as a mining boom cools, according to a Bloomberg
            survey of economists. The cost premium for protecting debt of
            the Big Four Australian banks over U.S. counterparts touched the
            most in almost six years this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The kind of banks that we've identified in places like
            the U.S., in parts of Europe and the U.K., and to a lesser
            extent in Australia, were all going to benefit from economies
            that were improving,' said Mark Beardow, 46, who runs the A$2
            billion ($1.75 billion) fund in Sydney. 'Many parts of the
            global corporate bond market are continuing to meaningfully
            deleverage, particularly financials.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Six-Year High &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average cost of credit-default swaps on Commonwealth
            Bank of Australia, Westpac and the country's next two biggest
            lenders versus the seven biggest U.S. banks widened to 17.4
            basis points on Jan. 3, the most since March 2008. It was 12.4
            basis points as of yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beardow, who talked by telephone yesterday, manages the
            fund in Sydney with Jeff Brunton and David Carruthers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. economic growth will quicken by 0.9 percentage point
            this year to 2.8 percent, based on Bloomberg News surveys of
            economists. The euro area's economy will go to a 1 percent
            expansion from a 0.4 percent contraction. In Australia, the pace
            will pick up by 0.35 percentage point to 2.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds of London-based Lloyds returned about 8 percent
            on average last year, the most among the biggest 50 corporate
            issuers in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Global Corporate
            High Yield Index. The bank's debt issued in Australia returned
            4.95 percent in 2013, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Big Four &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The returns beat the bonds of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac,
            Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National
            Australia Bank Ltd., the nation's four biggest lenders. The
            latter topped the list with a 4.71 percent gain, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens cut the
            benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.5 percent last year
            to maintain economic growth as the economy struggles to
            diversify amid a drop-off in mining investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beardow said he favors shorter-term securities in case
            yields rise. The fund's duration was 1.39 years in December,
            versus 2.76 years for the benchmark it uses to gauge
            performance, according to the AMP website. Duration is a measure
            of a portfolio's sensitivity to changes in bond yields, and a
            smaller figure offers more protection should borrowing costs
            increase. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. 10-year yields will be 3 percent to 3.5 percent by
            year-end, he said, from 2.76 percent as of 1:31 p.m. today in
            Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australian 10-year yields will climb to 4.25-4.75 percent,
            according to Beardow, from 4.05 percent today. Yields on U.S.
            and Australian government securities due in 10 years and longer
            have a correlation of 0.948. A figure of 1 means they move in
            lock-step. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fair Value' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Now we think rates are largely fair value,' he said.
            'We see fair value continuing to edge up.' The RBA will keep
            its benchmark at 2.5 percent this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Evans, the top-ranked chief economist at Westpac, says
            Stevens will need to cut the benchmark rate to 2 percent. Evans
            is the most accurate forecaster on Australia's economy,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would expect to see yields down in this country,'
            Evans said in a Jan. 24 interview. 'That would suggest that you
            should be buying bonds. We're not concerned about any credit
            risks associated with the banking sector. Bank bonds would
            similarly track the capital appreciation that we're expecting in
            government bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields will fall to 4 percent by year-end, Evans
            said in a Bloomberg survey of banks conducted Jan. 16 to Jan.
            21. It was the lowest forecast among 15 responses. An investor
            who bought today would earn about 4 percent if the forecast is
            correct, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The AMP Australian Corporate fund can invest up to 30
            percent of its assets in global corporate bonds, Beardow said.
            The challenge is to generate income with company notes and
            protect returns against higher borrowing costs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're pretty positive about the economy,' he said. 'We
            want to be particularly active around the possibility that
            yields do rise very sharply, and we're keeping duration pretty
            short.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seen Paying Dimon $34 Million Award This Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon, who got a 74 percent raise for his work in
            2013, stands to reap a separate and bigger payday within months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's board of directors, having delayed a decision
            for more than a year, has yet to say whether Dimon, 57, can
            collect 2 million stock options originally granted in 2008 and
            now worth about $34 million. Last week, the board increased his
            annual pay to $20 million from $11.5 million a year ago, when he
            was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Dimon's incentive package was created six years ago,
            JPMorgan grew to become the nation's largest bank with shares
            outperforming the industry, and then snapped a three-year run of
            record profits as costs from government probes surged. The
            board's decision to boost Dimon's annual pay despite mounting
            legal settlements shows he probably will get the full options
            award, said Alan Johnson, founder of compensation-consulting
            firm Johnson Associates Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's obvious the board wanted to send a signal about what
            they think of him,' Johnson said. 'It'd be very inconsistent
            to say, 'You're our guy, and we want to send an emphatic public
            message that we think very highly of you.' And then, 'Oh by the
            way, you didn't earn this over the last five years.'' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys Stake in Eight Geothermal Power Plants From Ormat</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) paid about
            $35.7 million for an interest in eight Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA)
            geothermal power plants in California and Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to pay Ormat an additional $8.7 million for
            25 percent of the value of production tax credits generated by
            the plants through the end of 2016, the Reno, Nevada-based
            developer said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The so-called tax equity investment gives JPMorgan
            production tax credits and accelerated depreciation benefits
            that Ormat isn't able to use, because 'we generate more
            deductions for tax purposes than we are currently able to
            utilize,' Ormat Chief Executive Officer Dita Bronicki said in
            the statement. The production tax credit for geothermal is 2.2
            cents a kilowatt-hour and applies to the first 10 years of a
            plant's operation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The eight plants are part of Ormat's Ormesa, Heber and
            Mammoth complexes in California and its Steamboat and Brady
            complexes in Nevada, Bronicki said today in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan invested $24.9 million in four of Ormat's Nevada
            facilities in a similar transaction in February 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Euro Bonds in Slowest New Issue Start Since 2008</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which sold 10-
            year dollar bonds at a record low 3.2 percent two weeks ago,
            priced similar-maturity notes in euros as debt sales in the
            currency head for the slowest January since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank by assets, which last issued euro
            debt in November, sold 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of bonds
            to yield 95 basis points above the swap rate, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the 155 basis-point
            spread Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid on 10-year debt it sold
            Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are poised to overtake industrial companies as the
            safest borrowers in the $5.1 trillion U.S. corporate bond market
            for the first time since the start of the financial crisis,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors demand an
            extra 154 basis points in yield over benchmarks to buy bonds of
            JPMorgan, Wells Fargo Co. and other lenders, compared with 138
            basis points for companies from Alcoa Inc. (AA) to Ford Motor Co.,
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Financials are perhaps dominating sales so far this year
            as they issued about 30 percent less debt in 2012 than they had
            in redemptions,' said Jonathan Pitkanen, the London-based head
            of credit research at Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd. 'The
            macro environment in Europe doesn't look to be improving which
            is why perhaps investors are becoming more wary of buying the
            bonds of non-financial corporates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interest Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
            dollars is holding near a 20-month low. The three-month cross-
            currency basis swap was little changed at 14 basis points below
            Euribor, the lowest cost to swap since May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's 1.5 billion euros of 2.75 percent bonds due in
            10 years which it sold in August yield 83 basis points more than
            swaps, 17 tighter than at issue, Bloomberg data show. The spread
            on Goldman Sachs' 3.25 percent debt due February 2023 has
            tightened five basis points since issue last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's sales lift corporate bond issuance in euros and
            pounds to 60.1 billion euros ($80.8 billion) so far this year,
            the slowest start to a year since 2008 when 34 billion euros
            were issued in the first three weeks of January, according to
            Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BASF SE (BAS) offered the only non-financial benchmark-sized bond
            in the single currency, Bloomberg data show. It priced 500
            million euros of eight-year notes to yield 38 basis points more
            than swaps, the tight end of the 40 basis point range initially
            marketed, a person with knowledge of that deal said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Good Value' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has been lots of seven-year to 10-year maturity
            issuance which is desirable if you are a treasurer but
            introduces an element of volatility for investors versus more
            traditional five-year paper,' said Jens Vanbrabant, lead
            portfolio manager at London-based investment firm ECM Asset
            Management Ltd. 'Nevertheless there are areas that still
            represent good value.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Financial Index
            of credit-default swaps on the senior debt of banks and insurers
            rose one basis point to 136 at 3:35 p.m. in London. The Markit
            iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade
            ratings increased one basis point to 106. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
            on 50 companies with mostly high-yield ratings added two basis
            points to 422. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
            million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
            to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
            exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
            should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A vice president in technology
            operations, Gabriel Magee, died after falling from JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s London headquarters, the bank said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 39-year-old fell from 25 Bank Street in the Canary
            Wharf area onto a ninth-floor roof, London's Metropolitan Police
            said, having been called to the scene at 8:02 this morning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magee had worked for JPMorgan since 2004 in the corporate
            and investment bank's technology support department, the New
            York-based lender said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are deeply saddened to have lost a member of the
            JPMorgan family at 25 Bank Street today,' said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London.
            'Our thoughts
            and sympathy are with his family and his friends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 11-year-old skyscraper is 33 stories high, according to
            building-data provider Emporis. It was formerly the European
            headquarters of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for
            the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in 2008. The police are
            not treating the death as suspicious and no arrests have been
            made. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan took over the office and began moving investment
            banking staff over to the building in January 2012, according to
            the lender's website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Bankers Raise $375 Million for Mining Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase Co. bankers
            Michael Scherb and Verne Grinstead raised $375 million from
            investors to target acquisitions of mining assets through their
            Appian Natural Resources Fund LP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The whole thesis was really created when I was at
            JPMorgan, when I could see that traditional sources of capital
            were going to dry up to the industry,' Scherb, who founded
            Appian two years ago after leaving the bank, said in a phone
            interview from London yesterday. 'I thought that private equity
            made sense. I thought it made sense to match long-term capital
            to a long-term industry.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Declining prices and a tapering in demand for commodities
            has dried up financing for new mining projects as investors
            retreat from the industry. Appian started raising funds a year
            ago and got commitments of $1 billion from investors, Scherb
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think are real firepower is probably actually double
            what our fund size is, so we want to deploy around $750 million
            in the space,' he said. 'We have a very strong co-investment
            component, a lot of that from investors who didn't make it into
            the fund, or overflow from investors who did make it into the
            fund but wanted to invest more.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Appian joins a swathe new private equity funds focused on
            the mining industry that are betting on a resurgence in demand
            for key commodities like copper, coal and zinc. X2 Resources,
            led by former Xstrata Plc (GLEN) Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis, is
            seeking to raise at least $3 billion from investors before it
            starts buying mines, people with knowledge of the plan said last
            week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mining Executives &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jersey-based Appian is run by a six-member management team
            including founder Scherb, Grinstead and managing partner Vincent Jacheet, who was part of setting up Bain
            Capital LLC in Europe.
            The team also includes three former mining industry executives
            to provide operational experience to the fund, Scherb, who
            advised mining firms while at JPMorgan, said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Appian has completed three deals, including an acquisition
            in Red Eagle Mining Corp. in September which boosted the fund's
            stake in the company to 15.3 percent, and has invested just
            under $100 million so far, he said. Two more acquisitions, one
            in Latin America and one in Africa, will be announced by the end
            of March, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We really want to deploy our capital over the next two
            years, our pipeline is pretty robust,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO), the two largest
            mining companies, are among mineral producers making or planning
            mine disposals that may total a combined $35 billion, Deutsche
            Bank AG has estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Africa, Europe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund is actively bidding on assets being disposed of by
            major mining companies, Scherb said. Appian is seeking
            acquisitions in North America, Latin America, Africa and Europe
            with an investment size of about $10 million to $100 million and
            targeting those where first production can be realized within
            three years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Appian is looking at five to seven projects or companies
            every week and declining about 90 percent of them, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see a lot of value out there, we see valuations having
            dropped off tremendously and it allows us good entry
            opportunities,' Scherb said. 'There are good assets out there
            that are just unloved by the market or undiscovered by the
            market.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Madoff Victims' Group Seeks to Opt Out of JPMorgan Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bernard Madoff victims who withdrew
            more money from the con man's firm than they invested -- and
            were slated for no recovery -- asked to be excluded from JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s $543 million settlement of lawsuits over the fraud
            so they can sue the bank on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A group of 193 investors said in a filing yesterday in U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that the accord between JPMorgan
            and Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff's defunct
            company, doesn't cover 'net winners.' They asked for court
            permission to not be part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group's lawyer, Helen Davis Chaitman of Becker
            Poliakoff LLP in New York, said she intends to file a new
            lawsuit on behalf of these and other victims who say they were
            harmed in Madoff's $17 billion Ponzi scheme, even though they
            didn't lose their principal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The existing settlement is 'inherently unfair,' Chaitman
            said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ponzi scheme's net winners have been fighting for their
            rights almost since Madoff's 2008 arrest. Their argument is that
            they are entitled to rely on the brokerage statements received
            from the con man's firm and should be compensated accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fictitious Statements &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Critics, ranging from trustee Picard and appeals court
            judges to investigators, say that Madoff clients received
            fictitious statements incorporating profits from trades that
            never happened, and those who lost money should be compensated
            first. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As a measure, Madoff customers' assets were originally
            estimated at $65 billion, including profits -- almost four times
            as much as Picard's current calculation of the $17 billion
            invested and lost when the Ponzi scheme collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those who profited from the Ponzi scheme -- though without
            getting all the money reflected on their brokerage statements --
            also have battled for their right to sue investors who allegedly
            knew about the fraud. Picard and the courts have mostly opposed
            them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mark Kornblau, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment on
            the group's position on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Warning Signs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is seeking to
            move on from allegations it helped prolong Madoff's fraud by
            ignoring warning signs and reaping profit from the con man's
            business. The bank agreed Jan. 7 to pay $1.7 billion to the U.S.
            to resolve criminal allegations and $350 million in a case by
            the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank simultaneously agreed to pay Picard $325 million
            to settle his civil lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims,
            and another $218 million to resolve two related class-action
            lawsuits that were filed with Picard's assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A hearing on the proposed accord is scheduled for Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chaitman said in yesterday's filing that victims who
            invested with Madoff for years, and believed the trading in
            their accounts was real, are entitled to some of their fake
            profit because Madoff deprived them of legitimate investment
            opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Picard has estimated there are about 2,500 net winners who
            want to recover some or all of the fake profit they saw on their
            customer account statements. 'Net losers' withdrew less money
            from Madoff's firm than they put in. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Parallel Efforts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the class-action lawsuits, JPMorgan is accused of aiding
            and abetting embezzlement, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust
            enrichment and gross negligence in relation to Madoff's fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal
            investigators have resulted in a total recovery for victims of
            almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard
            has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions
            more held in reserve until legal issues are resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chaitman and Picard's spokeswoman, Amanda Remus, both
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving
            a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina.
            Others including his brother Peter Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term, have pleaded guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five members of Madoff's inner circle, who worked for the
            con man for decades, are on trial in Manhattan federal court on
            charges of helping perpetuate the fraud to get rich. The five
            have pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection
            Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-bk-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District
            of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Coface SA, the French credit insurer
            owned by investment bank Natixis (KN) SA, is working with its parent
            and JPMorgan Chase Co. as it prepares for an initial public
            offering, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coface may raise about 500 million euros ($678 million) in
            an IPO being planned for this year, said one of the people, who
            asked not to be named because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Natixis plans to sell Coface shares on the stock market by
            the end of June as part of a plan to invest more in wholesale
            banking, asset management and 'specialized' financial
            services, Chief Executive Officer Laurent Mignon said in
            November. The volume of equity capital market deals in Europe
            almost doubled last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show,
            encouraging companies to line up asset sales for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for the banks declined to comment. A
            spokeswoman for Coface didn't respond to a request for comment
            left outside regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coface had an operating profit of 189 million euros on
            revenue of 1.57 billion euros in 2012, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Hires Petty as Co-Head of Health Care in Europe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) hired Cathrin Petty from U.K. private-equity firm Vitruvian Partners LLP
            as
            co-head of its health-care investment banking team in Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa amid rising activity in the sector. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Petty, who has almost 20 years of experience in health
            care, will work alongside the team's current head, Rakesh Patel,
            according a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. She will start next
            week and report to Laurence Hollingworth. The contents of the
            memo, written by Vis Raghavan, head of EMEA banking, were
            confirmed by a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before working as a partner at Vitruvian, Petty spent a
            decade at buyout firm Apax Partners LLP, eight of those years as
            a partner in the global health-care team, in charge of private-equity investments, the memo shows. Petty,
            who interned at
            JPMorgan in 1994, also worked at Schroders doing buyouts and
            venture deals for medical technology and pharmaceutical
            companies in Europe, India and the U.S., according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Acquisitions in the pharmaceuticals industry globally rose
            to $80.1 billion last year from $52 billion in 2012, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. Total mergers and acquisitions
            are 'set to accelerate' this year, led by pharmaceutical deals
            based on calculations of free-cash flow versus corporate bond
            yields, low debt levels and value-to-cost ratios, according to a
            Jan. 27 report by analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our EMEA investment banking health-care team has become
            increasingly active over the last year with a number of major
            transactions,' and JPMorgan seeks to 'build on this

            will work closely with the global health-care team and vice
            chairs Andrea Ponti and Steve Frank, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Extols Virtues of Ruble's Record Plunge: Russia Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble's plunge in this week's
            emerging-market selloff holds the promise of more competitive
            Russian exports and higher budget revenue, JPMorgan Chase
            Co.'s asset-management unit and Capital Economics Ltd. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has been limited official rhetoric about the need
            to prevent the ruble from weakening,' Liza Ermolenko, an
            emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics, said by phone
            from London. 'A weaker ruble improves competitiveness in
            international markets and boosts government revenue from oil.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry canceled a scheduled bond auction amid
            the developing-nation rout after selling less than 25 percent of
            the securities on offer this month. Russia should abstain from
            following Turkey and South Africa in raising interest rates to
            bolster the ruble, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Jan. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble tumbled to the lowest on record against the
            central bank's basket of dollars and euros this week as Chinese
            manufacturing contracted and the Federal Reserve pushed ahead
            with stimulus cuts. That slide helped drive the yield on
            Russia's February 2027 bond 14 basis points higher on Jan. 29,
            the most since June. That compares with a 10 basis-point advance
            for similarly dated debt from Mexico, which carries the same
            rating at Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Commodity Dependence &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil and natural gas exports account for about 50
            percent of Russia's budget revenue and President Vladimir Putin
            has urged officials to diversify the economy and reduce its
            dependence on commodities. Brent was steady yesterday at $107.95
            a barrel in London, compared with $36.61 in December 2008,
            before the currency reached its previous low. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm sure the government is happy seeing the currency
            weaken a bit,' Matias Silvani, who helps manage $35 billion of
            emerging-market debt at JPMorgan Asset Management in New York,
            said by e-mail yesterday. Russia is facing a 'weaker economy,
            exposure to commodities' and is 'trying to gain
            competitiveness,' he said. 'A weaker currency, managed, helps
            on all three fronts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elvira Nabiullina, the economic aide to Putin who took
            charge of Bank Rossii in June, resisted cutting rates last year
            to boost economic growth as inflation remained above target. The
            economy expanded 1.2 percent in the third quarter from a year
            earlier, matching the weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Auction Axed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry axed its auction on Jan. 29, citing
            market conditions, after issuing 750 million rubles out of 10
            billion rubles of 2019 bonds offered at a sale the previous
            week. While the ministry plans to sell bonds next week, it's not
            a problem if the first-quarter borrowing plan isn't met,
            Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of Finance Ministry's debt
            department, told reporters in Moscow yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the local currency depreciates, Russia's budget
            receives more rubles from taxes and duties paid by energy
            companies whose export revenue is priced in dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's budget deficit may be equal to 0.6 percent to 0.7
            percent of gross domestic product this year, the Interfax news
            service said Jan. 23, citing Siluanov. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Russia's 2027 OFZ bond has increased 50 basis
            points this year to 8.4 percent, the highest since July 2012,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Mexico's debt is
            up 26 basis points this year at 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Third Worst &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble climbed for the first day in six yesterday,
            adding 1 percent to 40.5092 against the basket after 6 p.m. in
            Moscow when the central bank ends its market operations. The
            ruble lost 6.5 percent against the dollar this year, the worst
            performer among the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
            Bloomberg, behind Argentina's peso and South Africa's rand. The
            currency retreated 0.3 percent to 40.6059 by 12:18 p.m. in
            Moscow today versus the basket. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Many investors are saying that it would be good for the
            central bank to raise rates,' Evgeny Kochemazov, head of fixed
            income at Alfa Capital in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.
            'That's probably the only way to stabilize the situation in the
            currency market, to prevent the growth of OFZ yields.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia is rated Baa1 at Moody's Investors Service, the
            third-lowest investment-grade category. The yield on the
            government's April 2020 dollar bonds was steady at 3.83 percent
            today. The extra yield investors demand to hold the nation's
            dollar debt over Treasuries dropped one basis point to 246. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian policy makers are scheduled to discuss borrowing
            costs on Feb. 14. Bank Rossii will leave the key one-week rate
            at 5.5 percent in the first and second quarter, according to the
            median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The economy stands to gain from the ruble's drop, according
            to Alexei Kudrin, a former Finance Minister. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Overall it's positive,' he said in Moscow yesterday.
            'It will support industry.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, whose eight years atop JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) have made him one of Wall Street's
            most powerful leaders, said he'll start treatment for throat cancer, raising new questions about succession
            plans at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, the company's chairman and chief executive
            officer, told employees and shareholders in a memo his condition is curable and that he'll continue running
            the firm 'as normal' during eight weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. The treatment will start soon at
            Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, limiting his travel, the CEO said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon,
            58, has led New York-based JPMorgan since the end of 2005, navigating the 2008 financial crisis without a
            loss and doubling annual profit as the lender's shares climbed 45 percent. Six months ago, the board
            credited his ability to resolve government probes of the bank. The illness will revive questions about how
            the panel would theoretically handle his succession, said Ralph Cole, a portfolio manager at Ferguson
            Wellman Capital Management Inc. in Portland, Oregon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Transition has always been a
            question and now that will be at the top of investors' minds,' Cole said. 'They have to be very vocal about
            who's going to be stepping up during the eight-week period. They've got to be clear with everybody about who
            that is.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Corporate Dealing Services Business</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to sell a
            business that manages stock-based pay plans for companies to
            Equiniti Group Ltd., a closely held U.K. financial-services
            provider. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equiniti, based in Lancing, England, didn't disclose what
            it will pay for JPMorgan's Corporate Dealing Services unit. The
            transaction is scheduled to be completed by Aug. 31, Equiniti
            said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The acquisition 'further strengthens our position,' Paul
            Matthews, managing director of corporate markets at Equiniti,
            said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest investment bank by revenue will partner
            with Equiniti to offer dealing services for share-based
            compensation packages to its corporate broking clients,
            according to the statement. JPMorgan is the largest corporate
            broker to companies in the FTSE 100, offering advice to 34
            clients in the index, according to Adviser Ranking Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equiniti was started in 2007 when Advent International
            Corp. acquired Lloyds Banking Group Plc's Lloyds TSB Registrars
            shareholder-services business in a management buyout. The firm,
            which manages share plans on behalf of customers, has 2,700
            employees and a client base of 1,600 companies, a spokeswoman
            for Equiniti said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Internal Probe Cleared Hannam of Market Abuse, He Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, formerly one of JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s top merger advisers, said the bank cleared him in
            an internal investigation before the U.K. finance regulator
            fined him for disclosing inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan believed that I had not done market abuse,'
            Hannam testified at a London court today, where he is fighting
            the 450,000-pound ($687,000) fine. 'They carried out this very
            serious investigation and I assure you that if they had found I
            had' broken any regulatory rules, 'I would not have been an
            employee there.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two e-mail messages form the basis of a proposed civil
            market-abuse fine against Hannam by the U.K. Financial Conduct
            Authority, which considers the content insider information.
            Hannam, formerly JPMorgan's global chairman of equity capital
            markets, said the notes were in the 'best interest' of his
            client, Heritage Oil Plc (HOIL), and is challenging the sanction at a
            court hearing at the Upper Tribunal in London that started
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, who resigned from the New York-based bank after the
            fine, is one of the highest-profile finance workers the
            regulator has targeted. Hannam was among the bankers advising
            Xstrata Plc before it was acquired by Glencore International
            Plc. (GLEN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I particularly enjoyed working for JPMorgan,' Hannam
            said. 'I would probably still be at JPMorgan.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, Heritage CEO Tony Buckingham and Chief Financial
            Officer Paul Atherton are scheduled to testify at the trial,
            which could last as long as two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, a former soldier, graduated from Imperial College
            London and London Business School, and trained at Salomon
            Brothers. In 1992, he joined Robert Fleming Co., which was
            bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000. Four years later, he helped
            to set up JPMorgan's joint venture with London-based Cazenove
            Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Bank Needs Capital Amid Higher Leverage, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) may face a capital
            shortfall of 12.3 billion euros ($16 billion) under a proposal
            on leverage by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision,
            according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Basel proposal, which is designed to include assets
            that are off banks' books, would lead to a 33 percent average
            increase in the balance sheet among the global investment banks
            tracked by JPMorgan, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein in London
            wrote in a report to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank 'needs to raise capital in our view' or
            reduce assets by 409 billion euros to reach the 3 percent
            leverage ratio target set by Basel, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Christian Streckert, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based
            Deutsche Bank, said the company generally doesn't comment on
            analyst research notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global regulators are increasingly looking at leverage, in
            addition to measures based on risk weightings assigned to
            different assets, to gauge banks' financial strength. Their
            focus intensified after some banks improved capital ratios
            following the financial crisis by altering internal models or
            cutting risk-weighted assets without correspondingly shrinking
            their balance sheets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By the same Basel measure, Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain's third-biggest lender by market value,
            will have a leverage ratio of
            3.5 percent by 2015, the analysts estimated. Still, the bank may
            also need to raise capital to meet the U.K.'s Prudential
            Regulation Authority's leverage requirements, according to
            JPMorgan. The bank may need 7 billion pounds ($10.6 billion), or
            a 240 billion-pound asset reduction, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

            Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase Co. to manage an initial public offering in London, according to people with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sale of the carrier, created in 2003, may happen as early
            as the second half of this year, one of the people said, asking not to be named as the plans aren't public.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies including state-run U.K. postal service Royal Mail Group Ltd. and vodka maker
            Stock Spirits Group are lining up IPOs in London as global investors return to the market. The carrier faces
            heightened competition in some of its markets as Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA), Europe's biggest discount
            airline, adds more bases in the east of the continent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Wizz Air in
            Geneva declined to comment on the proposed sale. Spokesmen for Barclays, Citigroup and JPMorgan also
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wizz Air has a fleet of more than 40 Airbus SAS single-aisle
            planes, with an average age of about three years, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Issuers in
            Europe, the Middle East and Africa raised about $12 billion in IPOs this year, more than double what they
            sold in the same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Deepens Iraq Business After Citi, Standard Chartered</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is the latest
            international bank after Citigroup Inc. (C) and Standard Chartered
            Plc (STAN) to expand business in Iraq as OPEC's second-largest producer
            boosts crude oil output and rebuilds its economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan signed a one-year agreement yesterday to help the
            Trade Bank of Iraq finance imports of goods and services, John Gibbons, managing director and EMEA regional
            executive for the
            New York-based bank, said in an interview in Baghdad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our focus is to open more letters of credit through the
            Trade Bank of Iraq on behalf of the government and its
            ministries,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq, with the world's fifth-largest proven oil reserves,
            is modernizing its infrastructure and energy industry after
            decades of sanctions, war and neglect. It produced 3.2 million
            barrels a day of crude in June, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg, and targets output of 3.5 million barrels by the end
            of the year. The government is boosting spending by 18 percent
            in 2013 to $118 billion, and the International Monetary Fund
            forecasts an annual economic growth rate of 9 percent, the
            fastest after Libya among 18 countries in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials are in talks with international banks about
            the opening of offices and branches in the country, Abdul-Basit Turki, acting governor of Iraq's central
            bank, said today in an
            interview in Baghdad. 'It is a rich market and the investment
            opportunities are huge,' Turki said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banking Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign banks were barred from the country until after the
            2003 U.S.-led invasion ousted the government of Saddam Hussein.
            Today, 15 international banks operate in Iraq, competing with
            seven state banks, 23 private lenders and nine banks operating
            under Islamic rules, according to the central bank's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup plans to open representative offices and branches
            in Baghdad and the cities of Basra and Erbil to benefit from an
            estimated $1 trillion of infrastructure spending, Mayank Malik,
            the U.S. bank's chief executive officer for Jordan, Iraq, Syria
            and the Palestinian territories, said in a June 27 interview.
            The lender is among international banks seeking to finance a
            pipeline to export Iraqi oil and natural gas through Jordan,
            Nateq Balasem Khalaf, deputy director general of Iraq's State
            Company for Oil Projects, said July 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered has said it will open branches this year
            in Baghdad and Erbil, followed by a third office next year in
            Basra, a southern oil hub. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Import Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement with JPMorgan will help the Trade Bank of
            Iraq 'open more letters of credit that we're in need of,'
            TBI chairman and president Hamdiyah Al Jaff said in an interview
            in Baghdad yesterday. JPMorgan helped set up TBI, the country's
            largest bank for trade finance, to facilitate imports needed for
            Iraq's postwar reconstruction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks in the country are set for growth in earnings and
            assets as a surge in lending in Iraq outpaces much of the Middle
            East, according to Singapore-based Sansar Capital Management
            LLC, which runs a fund with $30 million invested in Iraqi
            equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq's rising oil exports and a drop in the prime lending
            rate to 6 percent from 17 percent in 2008 are feeding the
            expansion. The five largest privately owned banks boosted their
            combined net income by 207 percent from 2010 to 2012 and more
            than doubled earnings per share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq's stock exchange drew investors in February when
            mobile operator Asiacell Communications PJSC listed after a $1.3
            billion share sale, in the Middle East's biggest initial public
            offering since 2008. The country's two other mobile operators,
            Zain Iraq and Korek Telecom, plan to sell shares in IPOs to
            comply with their license requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq is the biggest oil producer, after Saudi Arabia, in
            the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan and Danske Among Funds Exposed to Gowex Fraud</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Danske Bank
            A/S (DANSKE) funds are among investors in Let's Gowex SA (GOW), the Spanish
            Internet startup that's filing for insolvency after saying it
            falsified accounts for at least four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Euroland Focus fund had 2.9 percent of its
            holdings invested in Gowex as of May 31, while the bank's Europe
            Focus fund had 2 percent of its portfolio dedicated to the
            stock, according to the most recently available data on their
            website. Danske's Europe Absolute fund had 2.7 percent of its
            portfolio invested in Gowex as of June 30, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gowex founder and Chief Executive Officer Jenaro Garcia
            resigned on July 5, taking responsibility for the accounting
            fraud after a 60 percent drop in share prices in the wake of a
            report last week by short-seller Gotham City Research LLP saying
            the company inflated revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The responsibility isn't with just one person, it's also
            with the auditor and market regulator,' said Javier Flores at
            investor group Asinver, who puts the number of individual Gowex
            shareholders at some 5,000. 'The damage isn't only economic;
            it's also about the reputation of the Spanish market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jens Larsson, Danske Europe Absolute's portfolio manager,
            declined to comment, as did a Danske Capital spokesman. A
            JPMorgan spokeswoman in Madrid declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Touts Nakheel Saying Default Doubtful: Islamic Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. is advising
            clients to buy Nakheel PJSC's Islamic bonds after last month's
            record slump as new projects boost the Dubai developer's
            earnings, while government backing makes a default improbable. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;State-run Nakheel's 4.27 billion dirhams ($1.2 billion) of
            sukuk yielded 9.88 percent at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai, down seven
            basis points this month, after surging 179 basis points in June.
            That's more than twice the average gain in yields on corporate
            Islamic debt tracked by HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indexes. JPMorgan
            listed Nakheel in a July 4 research note as its 'top overweight
            recommendation' among Dubai real-estate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakheel will manage to pay or refinance as much as half of
            the $3 billion of debt due in 2016 as it generates at least $1
            billion from new projects and land sales, JPMorgan said.
            Investors have demanded higher yields to hold Nakheel's bonds
            since the company drove Dubai to the brink of default in 2009,
            prompting the government to extend a bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government is quite unlikely to let Nakheel default
            on its bond obligations in 2016 after supporting the company
            under much more difficult circumstances,' JPMorgan analyst
            Zafar Nazim wrote in the note. 'Nakheel has been a beneficiary
            of real-estate recovery in Dubai. We believe that new project
            launches and plot sales were not baked in the original
            restructuring plan that was agreed in 2010.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Home Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakheel, known for building an island shaped like the frond
            of a palm tree and another like a world map off Dubai's coast,
            has received at least $8 billion of cash from the government
            since announcing a standstill agreement with creditors in 2009,
            JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real estate industry in Dubai, one of seven sheikhdoms
            of the United Arab Emirates, has started recovering from a crash
            that sent prices plunging more than 65 percent. New projects
            such as the world's biggest Ferris wheel, a new district with
            100 hotels and the world's largest mall were unveiled in the
            past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sale prices for residential units have risen 28 percent
            from a trough in January 2011, according to an index tracked by
            Jones Lang LaSalle. Dubai's economy grew 4.4 percent in 2012,
            the fastest pace in five years. Against this backdrop, JPMorgan
            also recommends Islamic debt of Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR), developer
            of the world's tallest tower, and Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority
            FZE, which leases commercial real estate in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Averting Default &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Emaar's 6.4 percent securities due in July
            2019 has declined 25 basis points this month to 5.59 percent
            today, while Jafza's 7 percent sukuk due a month earlier yielded
            5.43 percent, down 30 basis points. The yield on HSBC/Nasdaq
            Dubai's Corporate U.S. Dollar Sukuk Index advanced 73 basis
            points last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dubai was able to avert bond default in all of its
            government-related entities and its economy has recovered to
            pre-crisis levels,' JPMorgan said. 'Nakheel has been a
            beneficiary of real-estate recovery in Dubai.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai's credit risk returned this year to levels it hasn't
            seen since late 2008 amid the global credit crisis, after state-linked companies paid or refinanced at least
            $3.75 billion since
            the start of 2012. Five-year credit default swaps, which protect
            investors against non-payment of debt, dropped 130 basis points
            in the past year to 220 on July 5, according to CMA. Middle East
            contracts fell 13 basis points, on average, to 302 in the
            period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Risky Sector' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, property prices in Dubai are likely to ease 'due to
            high levels of future supply, limited debt availability and more
            mature market regulations,' Alan Robertson, chief executive
            officer for the Middle East and North Africa at Jones Lang
            LaSalle, said by e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors dumping emerging-market assets sold debt of Dubai
            property companies last month amid an emerging-market rout
            triggered by Federal Reserve plans to trim its bond-buying
            program. Nakheel's debt isn't rated, while Emaar's bonds non-investment grade at Moody's Investors Service
            and Standard
            Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dubai's real estate is still considered a risky sector,'
            said Montasser Khelifi, Dubai-based senior manager for global
            markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd. 'When there's turmoil
            in the bond market, investors sell the debt, even though new
            projects in Dubai are announced regularly these days.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakheel's business prospects are improving. The company
            said in May it sold 471 villas valued at almost 1.9 billion
            dirhams. The developer also expects to sign an agreement with
            banks to extend the maturity by eight years from 2015 on 8
            billion dirhams of debt, a spokeswoman said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investing in Nakheel's sukuk may be a risk worth taking,
            Khelifi said. 'While its very possible Nakheel won't have the
            money to repay the bonds, it's good news that they're seeking to
            refinance their debt,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MF Global Settlement With JPMorgan Unit Approved by Judge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit's
            $100 million settlement with MF Global Inc. liquidators won
            court approval, paving the way for the return of more money to
            the failed brokerage's former customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement will allocate $100 million for the return of
            customer property, according to an order entered today in
            bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The agreement resolves claims
            against JPMorgan arising from transfers of customer property in
            the days before MF Global entered bankruptcy, as well as its
            actions as one of the brokerage's primary banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The motion is granted in all respects and the settlement
            agreement is authorized,' U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn
            said in the order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former customers sued MF Global, New York-based JPMorgan
            and other parties over the firm's collapse and James W. Giddens,
            trustee for the liquidating brokerage, joined the lawsuit. U.S.
            District Judge Victor Marrero is overseeing the class-action
            case while Glenn is handling the bankruptcy wind-down. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Giddens seeks to return an additional $200 million to
            customers from the settlement, which also recoups $29 million in
            MF Global funds held at the bank and completes a previous return
            of $417 million by JPMorgan. The bank will pay an additional
            $7.5 million to cover plaintiffs' legal fees, according to court
            papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Key Lender &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd., the parent company once run by
            former New Jersey Governor and ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Co-Chairman Jon Corzine, filed for
            bankruptcy in 2011 after a $6.3
            billion trade on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe's
            most indebted nations. Most MF Global client funds were held in
            JPMorgan accounts, and the bank was a key lender to the parent
            before it collapsed in the eighth-largest U.S bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement resolves all outstanding matters between
            JPMorgan and the MF Global estate, its customers and creditors.
            JPMorgan will get a $60 million general unsecured claim in the
            brokerage liquidation and the companies won't pursue any other
            claims against each other, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was agent for a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global's
            parent company before it failed and also loaned money to the
            brokerage and other affiliates, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The holding company's Chapter 11 case is In re MF Global
            Holdings Ltd., 11-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). The broker liquidation is In
            re MF Global Inc., 11-02790, same court. The class-action case
            is 11-cv-7866, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
            York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dollar May Advance Further, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index may extend the
            advance that took it to a three-year high, confirming a 'deeper
            rally phase' for the U.S. currency, if it breaks through key
            technical levels, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A sustained break by the benchmark gauge above a resistance
            level at 84.50 would clear the way for an advance to 84.90 to
            84.95, Niall O'Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at
            JPMorgan, wrote today in a client note. If the index increases
            beyond that, it may rally to 86.07, a level not reached since
            July 1, 2010. The Dollar Index touched 84.588 today, the highest
            since July 6, 2010, after a report last week showed stronger-than-forecast employment gains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have this bullish macro-fundamental backdrop for the
            dollar, and certainly we've seen that in the price action,'
            O'Connor said in a telephone interview. 'But now we have these
            next technical hurdles in play that I think we'll still need to
            break through to really confirm what we're seeing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index, which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
            to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
            trading partners, declined 0.2 percent to 84.268 today in New
            York after touching 84.588. It reached a four-month low of
            80.498 on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 84.90-84.95 level is the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
            retracement from the Dollar Index's 2010 high, according to
            O'Connor. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that
            securities tend to rise or fall by specific percentages after
            reaching a high or low. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Resistance is a level on a chart where sell orders may be
            clustered. In technical analysis, investors and analysts study
            charts of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a
            security currency or index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dollar surged after the Labor Department reported July
            5 that U.S. payrolls added 195,000 workers in June for a second
            month, spurring bets the Federal Reserve may begin dialing back
            unprecedented monetary stimulus that tends to debase the
            currency. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Trader Wins Review of FCA's Decision to Drop Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) trader
            Julien Grout was granted a court review of a U.K. regulator's
            decision to drop him from a probe into a $6.2 billion trading
            loss before he was allowed to respond to the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Lissack, Grout's lawyer, told the London court
            today that the decision by the Financial Conduct Authority was
            'irrational and unlawful.' The FCA dropped its probe into
            Grout because of pending U.S. charges, Lissack said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed in September to pay about $920 million to
            settle U.S. and U.K. investigations into the losses stemming
            from Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman who became known as the London
            Whale for the size of his positions. The U.S. also filed
            criminal charges against Grout and Javier Martin-Artajo, who
            oversaw synthetic credit trading at the bank's chief investment
            office in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The next stage in Mr. Grout's investigation would have
            been the issuing of a preliminary investigation report by the
            FCA addressing the specific allegations against him which,
            importantly, would be Mr. Grout's first opportunity to fully
            understand the case against him and to respond to it,' lawyers
            for Grout said in court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA report into the trading loss at JPMorgan has drawn
            objections from at least three of the New York-based bank's
            former employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FCA Challenges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grout is making another challenge to the FCA at a different
            court later this month, claiming he can be identified in its
            final report on the London Whale loss. Martin-Artajo asked the
            tribunal last month for more time to challenge the regulator's
            findings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, another JPMorgan executive, won a
            challenge against the regulator in April, claiming he should've
            been allowed to respond to the FCA's findings before they were
            published in the September settlement with JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has started proceedings to extradite Martin-Artajo
            from Spain. Grout, who wasn't in court, 'is in France, as a
            French national he is, as it were, safe there,' Lissack said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grout won't face a fair trial in the U.S. if he is tried in
            absentia, Judge Andrew Collins said when granting the judicial
            review to be heard later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA decided to drop its probe into Grout in December,
            the regulator said in court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It was 'not a proportionate use of resources to continue
            the investigation' into Grout given the U.S. investigation,
            Paul Stanley, a lawyer representing the FCA, said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan-Backed Debt Collector to Pay $3.2 Million Over FTC Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A debt-collection firm backed by
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s private equity unit agreed to pay $3.2
            million to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint that it
            illegally harassed consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fine, the largest levied by the FTC against a third-party debt collector according to an agency
            news release today,
            stems from charges that it used tactics including calling
            consumers multiple times a day, calling them early in the
            morning or late at night, and calling at consumers' workplaces.
            The company, Expert Global Solutions Inc., was also accused by
            the FTC of continuing to call consumers who denied owing a debt
            to its clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the settlement, if a consumer disputes the validity
            of the debt, the company must either end collection efforts or
            suspend them until they've conducted a 'reasonable
            investigation' to establish the debt's validity. The agreement
            also prohibits the company from treating consumers in the manner
            outlined in the FTC's charges, according to the agency's
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tom Hoy, a spokesman for the Expert Global, did not
            immediately respond to a request for comment. The FTC news
            release describes the company as 'the world's largest debt
            collection operation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stake in the firm is held by its private
            investment arm, One Equity Partners. According to the JPMorgan
            investment unit's website, Expert Global is based in Horsham,
            Pennsylvania, and has revenues of about $2 billion dollars, and
            40,000 employees in 14 countries. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ally Drops JPMorgan as Underwriter for Public Offering</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc., the auto lender
            majority-owned by U.S. taxpayers, dropped JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            from the list of underwriters for its planned initial public
            offering, saying rival banks were more committed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
            Barclays Plc (BARC) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) were listed as underwriters in
            an amended filing today by Detroit-based Ally. A filing in
            October included JPMorgan in addition to those five banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The lineup of global coordinators is a reflection of the
            investment the various banks have made in the Ally relationship
            over the last year,' Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for the auto
            lender, said in an e-mail today. Tasha Pelio of New York-based
            JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department has paid lower underwriting
            fees than other sellers as it exits investments in firms bailed
            out during the financial crisis. Underwriting fees were less
            than 1 percent for the sale of stock in firms such as General
            Motors Co. and American International Group Inc., compared with
            an average of more than 3 percent for additional equity
            offerings in the U.S. this year and about 5.5 percent for IPOs,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is seeking to exit its 74 percent stake in Ally
            after previously getting rid of holdings in Citigroup and AIG.
            Ally has sold units and worked to limit liabilities from its
            bankrupt mortgage business as Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter seeks to repay a $17.2 billion
            bailout. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;First Data Corp., led by former
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) co-Chief Operating Officer Frank Bisignano,
            hired the New York-based bank's former Chief Information Officer
            Guy Chiarello as president. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chiarello, 53, will receive an annual base salary of $1
            million and a bonus of no less than $2.5 million for 2013,
            Atlanta-based First Data said today in a regulatory filing. He
            will also be granted a signing bonus of $6.5 million that can be
            clawed back if he quits or is terminated for cause within two
            years, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First Data, owned by private-equity firm KKR Co.,
            recruited Bisignano in April from the biggest U.S. bank by
            assets. First Data, the largest merchant acquirer in the U.S.,
            helps retailers accept credit- and debit-card payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chiarello was CIO of JPMorgan for about five and a half
            years and held technology roles at New York-based Morgan Stanley
            for 23 years, according to the filing. The Wall Street Journal
            reported in May that Chiarello was leaving JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology and security were among Bisignano's
            responsibilities as co-COO, and he held executive roles within
            the payments industry earlier in his career. Bisignano, 53, was
            Citigroup Inc.'s CEO of global transaction services from 2002 to
            2005 and executive vice president of consumer lending in the
            early 1990s for First Fidelity Bancorp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matt Zames became JPMorgan's sole COO when Bisignano left
            the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan as Biggest Underwriter Sees More Losses: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The chief market strategist at
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's biggest underwriter of
            corporate bonds, says the worst first half of the year on record
            for the securities may only deepen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes have lost 3.7 percent on average since May 22
            when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress the
            central bank may begin curtailing its unprecedented stimulus
            program if economic conditions warrant, Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch index data show. The losses compare with a drop of 2.9
            percent for government securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The performance is a shock to bulls who expected the extra
            yield offered by corporates relative to government bonds to
            cushion any selloff that stemmed from the prospects for higher
            interest rates and a stronger economy. Instead, diminished
            dealer inventories of the securities brought on by regulatory
            changes has caused liquidity to drop, exacerbating the price
            declines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Through a whole set of new, post-crisis regulations, the
            potential buyers do not have the same capacity to absorb credit
            risk,' said Jan Loeys, who heads a global asset allocation
            strategy team at JPMorgan in New York, in a telephone interview.
            'The banks don't have the same ability to absorb this
            anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Credicorp Ltd. (BAP), owner of Peru's
            largest bank, may gain 32 percent by the end of the year as the
            Andean nation's economy grows, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan included Lima-based Credicorp, owner of Banco de
            Credito del Peru, in its list of top picks for the region after
            a 27 percent fall since April 1, saying economic growth will
            keep supporting earnings in the country's banking industry,
            according to an e-mailed note to clients dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We like the long-term secular growth story for financial
            services penetration in Peru,' Saul Martinez, an analyst at
            JPMorgan, said in the note. 'Credicorp will sustain healthy
            profitable levels, on average, in the coming years.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan maintained a year-end 2013 price target of $158
            per share for Credicorp, according to the note. The stock rose
            50 cents to $120 at 11:03 a.m. today in Lima. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credicorp is trading at 11.4 times its estimated earnings
            for the current year, 15 percent below its average estimated
            price-to-earnings ratio of the last four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peru's gross domestic product will grow 5.75 percent in
            2013 and 6 percent in 2014, the fastest of any major Latin
            American country after Panama, according to economists'
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fed Tapering Priced In for September, JPMorgan's Loomis Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. bond yields suggest investors
            anticipate the Federal Reserve will announce a reduction in
            asset purchases at its September policy meeting, according to
            JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Heather Loomis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tapering 'does appear to be baked in,' with as much as 80
            percent of the market expecting it, Loomis, director of fixed
            income in San Francisco for JPMorgan Private Bank, said during a
            television interview with Sara Eisen and Erik Schatzker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke 'has effectively said
            tapering will being and end within a year,' said Loomis, who
            helps oversee $909 billion in assets. 'The market is looking at
            2014 as the start of rates hikes.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year notes, the benchmark for everything from
            home mortgages to car loans, have risen about 45 basis points to
            2.64 percent since June 19, when Bernanke said policy makers may
            begin reducing asset purchases this year and end them in 2014.
            His comments were followed by two U.S. employment reports that
            showed higher-than-forecast job gains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
            bonds every month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs.
            Policy makers have also kept their target rate for overnight
            loans between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 to
            support the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over the longer term, interest rates are moving higher,'
            Loomis said. 'If you see changes in yields as a result of true
            healing and true growth in both GDP and employment within the
            economy,' both Treasury yields and the Standard Poor's 500
            Index 'can move up in tandem,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

            in portfolios and, by its nature, hard to detect,' the asset
            management unit said in an e-mail to clients, which was seen by
            Bloomberg News. Three funds run by the company had exposure to
            Let's Gowex, according to the e-mail. A JPMorgan press officer
            wasn't immediately available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Let's Gowex announced on Sunday that it would file for
            insolvency and that its chief executive officer had resigned.
            The company's shares dropped 60 percent last week following a
            report by Gotham City Research LLC that said Let's Gowex
            inflated revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the end of June, the stock was a 2.1 percent holding in
            JPMorgan Funds Europe Focus Fund, 2.9 percent in JPMorgan Funds
            Euroland Focus Fund and 0.31 percent in JPMorgan Funds Europe
            Strategic Growth Fund. Trading in the stock has been suspended
            since Thursday. JPMorgan Asset Management said the stock 'for
            the purposes of the portfolios involved, is now subject to
            consideration by the JPMAM Non Standard Pricing Committee.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Brazilian, Indonesian Stocks Lowered to Underweight at JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Brazilian (IBOV) and Indonesian (JCI) stocks were
            cut to the equivalent of sell by JPMorgan Chase Co. on concern
            slower growth in China will hurt exports in the Latin American
            country and a weaker rupiah will curb earnings growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's economic recovery may be hindered by higher
            spending by the government, JPMorgan analysts including Adrian Mowat wrote in a research note today.
            Protesters took to the
            streets last month to demand better public services in the
            country's biggest demonstrations in two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The response to the current unrest is policies that we
            believe add to fiscal deterioration,' the JPMorgan analysts
            wrote. 'Add to that the impact of higher global bond yields on
            a country with a current account deficit and China economic
            risk.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on Russian (INDEXCF) and South
            Korean stocks to the equivalent of hold. Russia will benefit
            from higher oil prices, which boosts the outlook for producers
            and also strengthens the country's currency and fiscal position. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In South Korea, local borrowing costs are expected to
            increase, benefiting life insurers and banks, even as policy
            makers hold the target lending rate for the rest of 2013,
            according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Private-Equity Unit Said to Get $1.1 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;CCMP Capital Advisors LLC, the former private-equity unit of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), gathered
            $1.1 billion in the first stage of fundraising for its latest private-equity pool, which has a $3.5 billion
            target, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The initial closing for CCMP
            Capital Investors III LP includes a $200 million commitment from the New York-based firm, said one of the
            people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Canada Pension Plan Investment
            Board, Alberta Investment Management Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS). are among investors who have
            committed money to the fund, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brooke Gordon, a spokeswoman at Sard
            Verbinnen Co., declined to comment on behalf of CCMP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CCMP Capital, which was founded in
            2006 by professionals who spun off from the buyout unit of JPMorgan Chase, is competing for capital in a
            crowded fundraising market. About 1,958 private-equity funds are seeking $770 billion, according to data
            from London-based research provider Preqin Ltd. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CCMP Capital makes buyout and
            growth-equity investments in the U.S. and Europe. Sectors of focus include consumer and retail, industrial,
            health care and energy, according to the firm's website. The firm typically invests $100 million to $500
            million of equity in companies. CCMP Capital earlier this year agreed to acquire Pure Gym Ltd., a gym
            operator in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm's prior fund closed in 2007 with $3.4 billion in
            commitments. CCMP Capital Investors II LP was producing a 14 percent net internal rate of return and a 1.5
            times multiple on invested capital as of June 30, according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Hires UBS's David Li as China Head, Replacing Shao</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, hired UBS AG (UBSN)'s former China Chairman David Li to lead
            the Wall Street firm's operations in the Asian nation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As senior country officer for China, Li will be responsible
            for JPMorgan's businesses and products in the country, according
            to the memo, which was confirmed by Marie Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman. Li, who was also previously
            UBS's country
            head for China, will join JPMorgan in October and be based in
            Beijing, the document showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Li replaces Zili Shao, JPMorgan's former China chairman and
            chief executive officer, who was named the bank's Asia-Pacific
            vice chairman in April. Fang Fang, the company's CEO of
            investment banking for China, resigned in March after more than
            12 years at the firm amid an investigation by U.S. regulators
            into its Asian hiring practices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shao, who joined JPMorgan in 2009, oversaw a China
            expansion that included the formation of a domestic securities
            venture, buying stakes in a trust and a guarantee company, and
            establishing a locally incorporated bank. Li spent nine years at
            Zurich-based UBS and helped set up UBS Securities Co., the
            firm's Chinese brokerage venture, of which he was chairman until
            he left the company. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Guyett Asia Co-Head as Esperdy Returns to U.S.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named Greg Guyett co-head of Asia-Pacific banking as part of a management
            shuffle in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guyett will succeed Therese Esperdy, who is returning to
            the U.S. to become global chairman of the financial institutions
            group, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News and
            confirmed by the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes come after a management shuffle in China in the
            wake of a probe by U.S. regulators into JPMorgan's Asian hiring
            practices. Guyett last year was named chief executive of
            JPMorgan's Greater China unit, a position that is being phased
            out. China will now be overseen by UBS AG's former China
            Chairman David Li, who is joining JPMorgan in October as head of
            the firm's operations in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guyett previously ran JPMorgan's Japan business and oversaw
            its global corporate bank. He will oversee investment banking,
            equity markets, and other operations in the Asia-Pacific with
            Tom DuCharme, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esperdy and DuCharme became co-heads of banking for Asia
            Pacific in 2012. Esperdy will return to the U.S., and work with
            the bank's financial services team around the world on cross-border deals, the memo states. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees BOC in Rearview as Asian Issues Boom: China Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Competition to arrange global bond
            sales in Asia is heating up as Chinese banks take advantage of
            their compatriots' dominance of fundraising in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of China Ltd.'s 3.7 percent market share ranked 10th
            in the first half as Chinese lenders comprised seven of the top
            30 sale managers, the highest on record, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. were the top three arrangers, even as
            Chinese issuers accounted for more than 50 percent of the $106.4
            billion-equivalent of issues denominated in either dollars, euro
            or yen in Asia ex-Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market has definitely become more competitive and
            you've seen the new entrance of Chinese banks,' said Mark Follett, the Hong Kong-based head of high-grade
            debt capital
            markets for Asia ex-Japan at JPMorgan, whose 8.6 percent market
            share trailed HSBC's 12.8 percent and Citigroup's 10.8 percent.
            There's 'still a clear separation between the top five or six
            players and the rest,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks from Asia's largest economy have raised their share
            of underwriting business to 9 percent from 4.4 percent five
            years ago as Chinese companies involve them in their offshore
            push. Dollar, euro and yen bond sales in Asia will set another
            record in 2014, beating 2013's $137 billion, the top five ranked
            arrangers say. Sales of bonds in yuan outside China are also
            heading for an all-time high. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Leading Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We aim to maintain the leading role in the offshore
            renminbi market and all the Chinese issues, leveraging our
            relationships in the Dim Sum market into the G3 currencies,'
            Tony Wang, deputy general manager for global markets at Bank of
            China (Hong Kong) Ltd., said in a July 10 interview. 'There are
            more Chinese companies expanding in overseas markets and picking
            Hong Kong as a funding platform. As a Chinese bank with
            international experience, we're able to understand their needs
            and the global dynamics.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's influence in the region's international bond market
            has grown, with the country's borrowers making up 60 percent of
            sales last quarter versus 47 percent the first three months of
            2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China's 10 biggest
            issuers make up 13 percent of JPMorgan's Asia Credit Index,
            which covers 324 companies around the region, Moody's Investors
            Service said in a June 23 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Footprint &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is further amplified when taking into account the
            level of state ownership that exists behind many of the
            country's bond issuers,' said Laura Acres, a Hong Kong-based
            analyst at Moody's. 'The China-based sub-index is skewed toward
            real estate, oil and gas and quasi-sovereigns, which together
            account for 20.4 percent of total exposure.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp., the parent company of Asia's
            largest oil refiner, raised $5 billion in April in the biggest
            offering of notes in the U.S. currency by an Asian issuer in
            more than a decade. The amount matched a sale in November 2003
            by Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled
            by Li Ka Shing, Asia's richest man. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That same month, Cnooc Ltd., China's largest offshore
            explorer, sold $4 billion of bonds and Tencent Holdings Ltd.,
            Asia's biggest Internet company, priced $2 billion of debt,
            making it the busiest month on record for dollar bonds in the
            region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some banks counter that as transaction sizes swell, bond-sale managers increasingly need a global
            footprint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;HSBC No. 1 &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Asian deals are being distributed more globally,
            especially in the high-grade space where we've seen U.S.
            investors in particular increasing their appetite for Asia,'
            said Hital Desai, a Hong Kong-based director in the Asia debt
            syndicate team at Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit.
            'Having a global distribution platform really allows us to
            connect the dots for both issuers and investors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America ranked fifth the first six months of the
            year, with a 6.9 percent market share that lagged Deutsche Bank
            AG's 7.4 percent. The next highest ranked Chinese bank after
            Bank of China was Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
            with 1.6 percent, followed by Citic Securities Co. with 1.1
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC has held the No. 1 place since 2010, helping to
            arrange 11.4 percent of sales in all of 2013 and 13.9 percent in
            2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Issuers across the region look to us for our consistency,
            innovative financing ideas and the full global reach of our
            platform,' said Alexi Chan, the head of HSBC's Asia-Pacific
            debt capital markets team. 'We're on track for another record
            year in Asian G3 currencies, assuming the current stable market
            conditions continue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Along with deal size, the list of banks on larger trades is
            also getting longer. China Petrochemical, known as Sinopec
            Group, picked 13 banks to underwrite its bond offering this year
            compared with 10 in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The flow from Chinese borrowers looks set to continue into
            the second half as property developers press on with their debt
            offensive. Shenzhen-based Redco Properties Group Ltd., rated B,
            five levels below investment grade, by Standard Poor's, began
            bond-investor meetings in Hong Kong and Singapore last week,
            people familiar with the matter said. The company hasn't tapped
            the U.S.-currency market previously, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With ongoing low rates, the second half is going to be a
            busier one for high yield,' said Deutsche Bank's Singapore-based Jacob Gearhart, the head of global risk
            syndicate for
            Asia. 'I also wouldn't rule out the class of 2011, five-year
            non-call three, issuers seeking to refinance.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Adding Europe Property Risk as Safe Prices Rise</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset
            management unit intends to quadruple its holdings of European
            commercial property in need of renovations or new tenants as
            well-occupied buildings in good condition become too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company plans to raise its ownership of
            'opportunistic' properties in the region to about 4 billion
            euros ($5.4 billion) over three years, according to Peter Reilly, the company's head of European real
            estate. During that
            time, the New York-based investor will acquire less lower-risk,
            or core, real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the next three years our buying activity will probably
            be 80 percent opportunistic, whereas through 2012 it was 80
            percent core,' Reilly said in an interview. 'Our buy activity
            shifts as the capital market shifts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors like JPMorgan Asset Management, which holds about
            $63 billion of real estate, rushed to the safety of Europe's
            most stable income-producing properties after the financial
            crisis. Firms are now flocking to riskier office buildings,
            shops and warehouses as prices for the safest assets in Europe
            climb to their highest level since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almost 60 percent of investors were searching for riskier
            properties at the end of the first quarter, up from 47 percent a
            year earlier, according to a study by London-based research firm
            Preqin Ltd. The proportion of buyers seeking the highest quality
            buildings with tenants in place dropped to 35 percent from 56
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;International Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management owns about 3 billion euros of
            core properties in Europe, including offices, shops and
            warehouses in the U.K., France and Germany, Reilly said. The
            majority of its property holdings, about $45.5 billion excluding
            real estate investment trusts, is in the U.S. Europe is second
            at about $7.8 billion and Asia trails with around $1.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buying properties in need of investment to reach their
            earnings potential is easier now because banks are more willing
            to sell underperforming loans tied to real estate than they had
            been in the aftermath of the financial crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Conversations with banks are more productive today than
            they were a couple of years ago,' when there was a big
            difference between asking prices and bids, Reilly said. 'That
            should accelerate through 2015.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks will sell loans with a face value of 83 billion euros
            this year, 30 percent more than in 2013, as they clean up their
            balance sheets to focus on new business, according to data
            compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan unit will focus on buying offices in large
            cities including Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and
            the English cities of Birmingham and Manchester. High prices in
            London make it difficult to find profitable deals there, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We like troubled assets in really good markets,' he
            said. 'So when you fix the asset, you've got a core property.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees More Pain in Mortgages If Rates Remain High</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co (JPM). Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned investors that higher interest
            rates could lead to a 'dramatic reduction' in the bank's profits by eroding demand for mortgage refinancing.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The surge in 30-year home-loan rates to 4.46 percent at the end of June from 3.51
            percent in mid-May caused second-quarter mortgage-fee revenue to decline 20 percent, the New York-based bank
            reported today. Refinancing volume could fall as much as 40 percent in the second half if rates remain
            elevated, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told analysts on a call today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            environment in late May and June drove mortgage rates up significantly,' Lake, 43, said. 'This pressure
            continued into July, and we expect it could have a significant impact on the refinance market side.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Long-term borrowing costs climbed in the second quarter after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
            Bernanke indicated on May 22 that the central bank may be preparing to slow its purchases of government and
            mortgage bonds, a program that has helped suppress rates. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, might
            speed up its planned 19,000 job cuts 'given what's going on in the market,' Lake told journalists on a
            conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Investment Bank's 1st-Half Pay Little Changed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and
            investment bank allocated almost the same amount of money for
            employees in the first half from a year earlier as the
            division's revenue climbed 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $6.36 billion in first-half compensation costs
            amounted to 33 percent of revenue, excluding accounting
            adjustments, down from 34 percent in the prior year, according
            to figures posted today on the New York-based firm's website.
            The amount is equal to $122,926 for each of the division's
            51,771 employees in the six months. The unit had 52,336
            employees a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, combined its
            investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and
            securities-services units last year under co-heads Mike Cavanagh, 47, and Daniel Pinto, 50. The group has
            more than
            twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
            years. Figures for average pay don't represent what individuals
            actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Aussie May Fall to 3-Year Low, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar may fall to
            its lowest level in almost three years after breaching a key
            level of support, according to JPMorgan Chase Co., citing
            technical indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aussie may decline to 87.70 U.S. cents, its weakest
            level since July 22, 2010, after falling below minor support at
            90, according to Niall O'Connor, a New York-based technical
            analyst at JPMorgan. Australia's currency weakened to less than
            90 today for the first time since September 2010. The Aussie has
            been the worst-performing major currency over the last six
            months, decreasing 14 percent versus the U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Today's decline suggests a higher risk for new lows into
            next week,' O'Connor wrote in an e-mail. 'Deeper targets enter
            at the 87.70-to-88.80 zone. It should try to bounce from
            there.' The target zone represents the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
            retracement from the 2010 low, O'Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's currency depreciated 1.4 percent to 90.61 U.S.
            cents at 10:51 a.m. in New York after earlier falling as much as
            2.1 percent to 89.99. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
            of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
            currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
            sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
            may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
            mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
            on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
            after reaching a new high or low. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Trails Proposed U.S. Capital Rule Dimon Dislikes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s ratio of
            capital to total assets falls short of a proposed U.S. minimum
            that Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon criticized for
            diverging from the standard other nations' lenders face. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's so-called leverage ratio at its holding company
            is 4.7 percent, below the 5 percent proposed U.S. minimum, the
            New York-based bank said today in a presentation. The ratio at
            its deposit-taking subsidiary is even lower, creating a wider
            gap to the 6 percent proposed standard for those units, Chief
            Financial Officer Marianne Lake said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. plan goes beyond the 3 percent global minimum
            requirement that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
            approved to help prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis.
            The changes would make lenders fund more assets with capital
            that can absorb losses instead of using borrowed money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If one is 3 percent and one is 6 percent, that becomes
            just too big, and over time it can have huge competitive
            effects,' Dimon said on the conference call with analysts. 'We
            always ran with higher capital and liquidity than most of our
            competitors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it plans to be in line with the holding
            company standard by the first quarter of 2015. The company plans
            to bring the federally insured bank subsidiary into compliance
            by the end of that year, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dividends &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said it can increase its holding company leverage
            ratio by 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage points, with capital
            generated from earnings through the next six quarters if it
            keeps payouts to shareholders constant. JPMorgan could also
            boost the ratio as much as 1 percentage point by issuing
            preferred shares and making adjustments such as unwinding
            derivative bets, according to the bank's presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon said the company can achieve the new ratios and
            accelerate share buybacks and dividends over the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed U.S. rule will add unfunded commitments and
            some derivatives exposure to banks' stated assets. That will
            increase JPMorgan's total assets by about $1 trillion from the
            $2.4 trillion on its balance sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Basel committee has proposed additional increases to
            asset calculations, which Lake said could have a 'not
            insignificant' impact on the ratio. Lake also said there is a
            'strong argument' that the firm's more than $450 billion of
            cash and highly liquid assets should be excluded from the
            calculation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The leverage ratio provides an additional measure of
            capital to Basel III ratios that weight assets based on risk,
            which results in an asset figure that is half of that under the
            leverage ratio. The firm said its Basel III Tier 1 common ratio
            climbed to 9.3 percent and plans to reach 9.5 percent by the end
            of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the leverage ratio is an appropriate
            complement to a Tier 1 common ratio, if properly calibrated,'
            Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Sees Banks Hurt by Emerging Market Drop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon praised his traders' handling of a plunge in
            emerging-market assets last month and cautioned that other banks
            may not have fared as well. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our folks in emerging markets also did a spectacularly
            good job, because I think you might see some real
            differentiation there from some other folks on how their numbers
            come out,' Dimon said today on a conference call with analysts
            after the New York-based bank reported second-quarter earnings.
            'Obviously, when spreads widen out, certain businesses are more
            at risk than others. In emerging markets, we probably saw the
            most volatility.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Risk premiums on emerging market debt widened after Federal
            Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the central bank
            might taper its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, which
            have boosted demand for higher yielding assets. Prices of
            emerging-market government and corporate bonds fell 6.23 percent
            in the quarter, according to Bank of America Corp. data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stocks also fell as manufacturing in China contracted and
            protests erupted in Brazil and Turkey. The MSCI Emerging Markets
            Index dropped 16 percent from May 21 to June 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose emerging-markets trading is overseen by
            London-based James Kenny, generated $4.08 billion in revenue
            from fixed-income trading during the quarter, up 17 percent from
            a year earlier. That topped the 5 percent increase expected by
            Deutsche Bank AG analyst Matt O'Connor and the 4 percent rise
            predicted by Wells Fargo Co. (WFC)'s Matt Burnell. Equity-trading
            revenue rose 24 percent from a year earlier to $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Dimon warned about divergence among banks' trading
            performance, some analysts took the firm's better-than-expected
            revenue as a good sign for the industry, including Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS), which reports results on July 16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Traders know how to manage money in a volatile fixed-income environment -- nothing really blew
            up,' Brad Hintz, an
            analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., said on 'The Hays
            Advantage' Bloomberg Radio program. 'So I'm optimistic about
            Goldman going forward, because if Jamie did well, this is
            usually a good sign that the other trading house did well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's results in June weren't as strong as those in
            April and May, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. That
            month featured declines in the Standard Poor's 500 Index and
            corporate and Treasury bonds after Bernanke said the Fed would
            consider cutting back stimulus efforts if economic growth
            improves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's value-at-risk, an estimate of potential trading
            losses, fell to $40 million in its corporate and investment bank
            during the quarter, the lowest since JPMorgan bought Bank One
            Corp. in 2004. The drop in the measure, which climbed in June,
            was driven by lower volatility in asset prices and a reduction
            in JPMorgan's own risk appetite, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The client flows, they held up,' Lake said on the call.
            'So if you surround that with robust and strong trading risk
            discipline, that's pretty much how it panned out.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Housing Unfazed as Dimon Sees JPMorgan Profit Squeeze</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors last week that rising
            interest rates could trigger a 'dramatic reduction' in the bank's mortgage profits. According to its own
            analysts, the U.S. housing market will extend its recovery regardless. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rate for
            30-year home loans jumped to 4.51 percent last week from a near record-low of 3.35 percent in early May
            after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the central bank may slow its purchases of
            government and mortgage bonds. Refinancing, which has slumped to the lowest in two years, may drop by as
            much as 40 percent in the second half of this year, JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said July
            12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Home prices rising at the fastest pace since 2006 can withstand higher rates as
            lenders ease underwriting standards, job growth fuels demand and the supply of distressed properties
            dwindles, JPMorgan analysts led by John Sim wrote in a July 10 report. The New York-based researchers
            increased their forecast for price appreciation to 10.1 percent this year from 7 percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has been widespread concern that rising rates may hurt the housing recovery,' the analysts
            said. 'We do not think that the recent market move will change the broader story of increased homebuyer
            activity.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernanke said last month that rates have risen in part because of optimism
            about the economy and 'perceptions of the Federal Reserve.' Home prices rose 12.1 percent in April from the
            prior year, according to the SP/Case-Shiller Index, with increases in each of the 20 cities in the measure.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'More Optimistic' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People are more optimistic about housing. They
            expect house prices to continue to rise,' he said. That 'compensates to some extent for a slightly higher
            mortgage rate.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growth has been driven by a lack of housing stock coupled with demand
            from institutional investors, including private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX), which has purchased
            more than 30,000 single-family homes to rent. The number of homes for sale fell 5 percent to 1.74 million in
            January from the year-earlier period, the fewest since December 1999, according to the National Association
            of Realtors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For banks, including Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the nation's largest home-loan
            lender, and No. 2 JPMorgan, rising rates may be more detrimental after the lenders benefited from record
            profit margins in the mortgage business in 2012. Refinancing accounted for 76 percent of last year's $1.75
            trillion in loan originations. Originations may fall 10 percent this year, the Mortgage Bankers Association
            forecast in a June 20 report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Relatively Robust &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'For most
            mortgages outstanding now, the rate does not provide an incentive for refinancing,' said Walt Schmidt, a
            mortgage strategist at FTN Financial. 'These margins have remained relatively robust for the banks and
            they're not going to be making that money anymore.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, one of the biggest
            beneficiaries of the housing recovery, originated almost 1 in 3 mortgages in 2012, helping it post a third
            straight year of record profit. The firm said last week that it made $2.8 billion from mortgage banking in
            the second quarter, 3 percent less than a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New home loans fell rapidly
            after Bernanke's comments and probably slowed Wells Fargo's mortgage business, Richard Staite, a
            London-based analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP, wrote in a June 12 report. Mortgages comprised about 14
            percent of total revenue last year, a contribution that may plunge by more than a third this year to $7.5
            billion, from $12.2 billion last year, and to $4.8 billion in 2014, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Big
            Change' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You're going to see a big change in mortgage profits in the second half of
            this year compared to what you've seen in 2012 and the first half of this year,' said Kevin Barker, an
            analyst at Washington-based Compass Point Research Trading LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, has led
            JPMorgan to record earnings over the past three years as the Fed's stimulus boosted the economy and bank
            profits. Mortgage fees and related revenue at the bank dropped 20 percent to $1.82 billion in the second
            quarter, compared with $2.27 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the recent increase in interest
            rates holds, homeowner refinancing could be reduced by 30 percent to 40 percent in the second half of this
            year, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're trying to be clear with you that this would be a significant
            event,' she said on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It definitely could be that severe,' Barker
            said. '2012 and the first half of this year have been historically good quarters for mortgage banking so I
            would argue that the market was already generous for mortgage banks.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan may accelerate a job-cut program announced earlier in the year. The bank said in February
            it's eliminating as many as 19,000 jobs in its mortgage and community-banking divisions through 2014 as
            Dimon trims expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company reported a 31 percent increase in second-quarter net
            income to $6.5 billion, or $1.60 a share, as a 10 percent jump in trading and investment banking revenue
            outweighed a 3 percent drop at the consumer and community banking unit. Its shares have gained 52 percent in
            the last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rising rates and a decline in refinancing could expand credit
            availability that's been restricted following the housing crash by forcing lenders to compete more
            aggressively for homebuyers, said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Washington-based Fannie Mae. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks, 'if they want to stay in business, they're going to compete,' he said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Historic Lows &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mortgage costs are also still near historic lows, with the rate
            down from 6.8 percent in 2006, more than 10 percent in 1990 and 18.63 percent in 1981. Housing affordability
            in January reached its highest level in records dating to 1989, according to the National Association of
            Realtors, and prices are still 26 percent below their peak seven years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S.
            homebuilders have rallied 4.8 percent this month and are up 30 percent in the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As long as home price appreciation, job growth and easing of lending standards 'continue to move in
            a positive direction as expected,' most of the negative effect on housing demand would be offset, the
            JPMorgan analysts wrote. Under those circumstances, homes sales would stay above 4.8 million even with a 2
            percentage point rise in mortgage rates from 2012 levels, creating the highest level of net demand since
            2006, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The next two months of existing and new home sales will be critical to
            see if higher rates will affect the economy,' said Schmidt. 'The current standard view of affordability is
            still pretty high and it will take more than 100 basis points to change that.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- With

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, posted second-quarter profit that beat estimates
            as fixed-income trading revenue fell less than analysts expected. The stock climbed the most in eight
            months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income declined 7.9 percent to $5.99 billion, or $1.46 a share, from $6.5
            billion, or $1.60, a year earlier, the New York-based firm said today in a statement. Earnings excluding
            some items were $1.59 a share, topping the $1.31 average estimate of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
            Revenue slid 2.3 percent to $25.4 billion from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quarterly results were
            overshadowed by questions about the health of Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, who said July 1 that
            he would soon undergo radiation and chemotherapy for throat cancer. While Dimon reiterated today that his
            prognosis is excellent and that he'll be able to work during eight weeks of treatment, the disclosure raised

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon plans to be involved running the bank
            at a less intense pace as he fights throat cancer and said that the company is prepared for 'all scenarios.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors told him he will need to rest after he undergoes an eight-week regimen of
            radiation and chemotherapy, he said today on a conference call with journalists. Dimon said he'll continue
            to spend time in his office and take phone calls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan is 'to take it easy,' Dimon
            said. 'It doesn't mean not to work at all, but to focus on my health.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 58, raised
            fresh questions about succession planning at the New York-based bank when he announced the diagnosis July 1.
            He said today that Lee Raymond, the company's lead director, is available if managers need guidance while
            Dimon is unavailable and that the board already had protocols in place for succession planning. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Releases First U.S. Index to Measure CLO Returns</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has created the
            first U.S. index of its type to measure returns of
            collateralized loan obligations, which are on pace for a record
            year of issuance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CLOIE gauge will be available for use today, according
            to Gloria Kim, the head of global index research at the bank in
            New York. The measure will allow users to track the price and
            total return of CLOs and their debt portions, according to the
            bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan forecasts that as much as a record $100 billion of
            the funds that bundle junk-rated loans into securities with
            ratings as high as AAA may be sold in the U.S. this year. There
            has been $66.6 billion arranged in 2014, according to data from
            the bank. CLOs helped finance some of the biggest leveraged
            buyouts during the last credit boom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is the 'first time anyone has tried to create a
            realistic index with rules that track the price performance and
            total return' of CLOs, Rishad Ahluwalia, global head of CLO
            research at JPMorgan in London, said in a telephone interview.
            'We want to challenge the market to improve transparency and
            while this will evolve over time, we want to help move it
            forward as the market develops.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CLOIE tracks floating-rate CLO securities for deals
            dating back to 2004, according to information from the bank.
            Additional sub-indexes are divided by ratings AAA through BB.
            Pricing for the index is provided by PricingDirect Inc., an
            affiliate of JPMorgan, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Transparent Benchmark' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For a while we wanted to create a transparent benchmark
            for investors that tracked returns,' Ahluwalia said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The AAA rated portion of CLOs raised after the credit
            crisis has returned 1.07 percent this year, according to the
            JPMorgan CLOIE Index. That compares with 0.31 percent for all of
            2013 and 3.86 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CLO measure follows the introduction of the JPMorgan
            Asset-Backed Securities Indices in 2013, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CLOs pool high-yield corporate loans and slice them into
            securities of varying risk and return, typically from AAA
            ratings down to B. The lowest portion, known as the equity
            tranche, offers the highest potential returns and the greatest
            risk because investors are the first to see their interest
            payouts reduced when loans backing the CLO default. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Barclays Names JPMorgan's Morzaria as CFO to Replace Lucas</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC), Britain's second-largest bank by assets, hired Tushar Morzaria from JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) to replace Chris Lucas as chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morzaria, CFO of corporate and investment banking at New
            York-based JPMorgan, will join Barclays in the autumn before
            Lucas retires on Feb. 28, the London-based bank said in a
            statement today. JPMorgan said in a memorandum to employees it
            will name a successor to Morzaria, 44, in coming days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a good choice,' said Chirantan Barua, an analyst at
            Bernstein Research in London with an outperform rating on
            Barclays. His 'investment banking background helps because
            that's the one we want to invest in Barclays for, and that's the
            area which comes under risk every time from politicians.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Antony Jenkins, who took over as chief executive officer in
            August, is trying to reduce costs and rebuild regulators'
            confidence in the company following the lender's 290 million-pound ($438 million) fine for rigging benchmark
            interest rates.
            Lucas, 52, is the last of ex-CEO Robert Diamond's senior
            executives to depart. The investment bank generated about half
            of the bank's 2012 revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock slipped 0.5 percent to 308.15 pence in London
            trading for a market value of 40 billion pounds. The shares are
            up 17 percent this year, making it the second best-performing
            U.K. bank stock this year after Lloyds Banking Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, is near a deal with the Federal Energy Regulatory
            Commission to settle allegations that the lender rigged
            electricity markets, the Wall Street Journal reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, which would resolve claims that the bank
            manipulated power prices in California and the Midwest, could
            require the largest payout in the agency's history, according to
            the report, which cited people familiar with the discussions.
            Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, and
            Mary O'Driscoll, a FERC spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Previous negotiations between JPMorgan and the regulator
            involved a payout figure close to $1 billion, according to the
            Wall Street Journal. A deal could cost the bank $500 million,
            the New York Times reported today, citing people briefed on the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC warned JPMorgan in March that its personnel and two
            subsidiaries may face claims stemming from a probe into its
            bidding practices, according to a regulatory disclosure from the
            bank in May. Claims may include 'alleged violations of FERC
            rules and the rules of certain independent system operators,'
            the lender said at the time, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff has stepped up scrutiny of
            corporations as the agency wields policing powers that were
            expanded in the wake of Enron Corp.'s 2001 collapse.
            Wellinghoff, whose term was due to expire June 30, submitted his
            resignation in May. President Barack Obama asked him to stay
            until a new commissioner is confirmed by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday the regulator ordered Barclays Plc (BARC) and four
            former traders to pay a combined $487.9 million in fines and
            penalties for engaging in what the agency said was a scheme to
            manipulate energy markets in the Western U.S. from November 2006
            to December 2008. London-based Barclays said it would
            'vigorously' fight the penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Agency investigators may seek to hold JPMorgan traders and
            commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters 'individually liable,'
            the New York Times reported in May, citing a 70-page document
            the watchdog sent the bank in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FERC revoked a JPMorgan unit's right to trade power for
            six months in November after accusing the firm of providing
            misleading information to a California energy authority. The
            suspension, which took effect in April, marked the first such
            sanction for an active market participant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG is among companies that have settled with
            FERC. The Frankfurt-based lender agreed on Jan. 22 to pay $1.6
            million to resolve FERC claims that an energy-trading unit
            manipulated markets in 2010. The bank, Germany's biggest, didn't
            admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will let Jamie Dimon collect about $37 million in stock options created
            during the financial crisis, as the board stands by its leader after risk-management lapses and billions of
            dollars in legal settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave the chief executive officer 2 million
            stock-appreciation rights in January 2008, saying they would be available in five years if the board still
            deemed it appropriate. Last year, the firm delayed vesting by 18 months to address flawed internal controls
            exposed by botched derivatives bets. JPMorgan resolved a variety of probes in the months that followed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board 'decided not to further defer the vesting of these options at the July 2014 meeting,' Joe
            Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said today after the vesting of the grant was
            disclosed in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the package's creation, JPMorgan has become the
            nation's largest lender, acquiring Bears Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.'s bank units at the height
            of the crisis. As Dimon, 58, navigated the regulatory setbacks, the board signaled support for his work as
            CEO and chairman, boosting his pay 74 percent to $20 million in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The options
            have a $39.83 strike price and expire in January 2018. JPMorgan's stock closed today at $57.86, giving the
            award a value of about $37 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., HSBC Holdings
            Plc and Bank of America Merrill Lynch were hired by the city of
            Buenos Aires to sell as much as $890 million of global bonds,
            according to two people with direct knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's capital city said it received approval from
            local lawmakers to sell debt with a minimum maturity of five
            years. The funds will be used to pay down $475 million of debt
            coming due in 2015 and extend maturities, said the people, who
            asked not to be identified because they're not authorized to
            speak publicly about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks handling the sale are waiting for the right
            moment to sell the debt, the people said. There's no date

            the people, who is an official at the city's Finance Ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
            comment. BAML officials couldn't be reached. HSBC press official
            Robert Sherman didn't respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This would be the city of Buenos Aires' first international
            bond sale since 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentine companies and provinces are waiting for lower
            interest rates to sell as much as $2 billion of bonds later this
            year, according to Puente Sociedad de Bolsa SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While average yields hit three-year lows last week, the
            government faces a July 30 deadline to settle with holdout
            creditors or fall into default on restructured debt. U.S.
            District Court judge blocked a $539 million payment due June 30,
            saying it violated his orders to pay defaulted bondholders at
            the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The city's 12.5 percent notes due next year fell 0.38 cent
            to 101.53 cents on the dollar at 12:51 p.m. in Buenos Aires,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield rose 55 basis
            points, or 0.55 percentage point, to 10.14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Liquidity Myth Seen by JPMorgan as Trading Gains: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Rising corporate-bond trading
            signals that liquidity is robust even as Wall Street's biggest
            banks cut their inventories of the securities in response to new
            rules and regulations, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average daily trading volumes in U.S. investment-grade
            corporate bonds has increased 18 percent since the end of April
            from the same period last year, while dealers pared holdings of
            the debt by 54 percent in the five weeks ended July 3, data from
            the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Federal
            Reserve show. The so-called bid-ask spread that dealers charge
            in bond trades grew 3 basis points in the period, less than half
            the increase in 2011 amid Europe's fiscal crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almost five years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc., credit markets are becoming better oiled to
            withstand stress, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a July 12 note. Rather than
            driving
            liquidity by taking big positions, banks are simply acting as
            the go-between for buyers and sellers, while the number of
            market makers increases and electronic systems emerge to
            facilitate trading, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Buffers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The only way for the market to work when dealers can't
            act as a buffer is if you're able to match a seller from a
            mutual fund with a buyer from an institutional investor, and so
            far that has worked,' Bank of America Corp. credit strategist
            Hans Mikkelsen said in a telephone interview. 'Back in the old
            days, dealers were able to act as buffers in the market: they
            would accumulate bonds on their balance sheets, and that's not
            happening anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds lost 5 percent
            in the two months ended June, the biggest declines since the
            2008 financial crisis, as concern mounted that the Fed was
            preparing to scale back stimulus measures that have bolstered
            debt prices, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The recent volatility episode has not significantly
            affected either trading volumes or the bid-ask spreads of the
            largest U.S. high-grade corporate bonds,' the JPMorgan analysts
            wrote. 'Broker-dealers have become a lot more efficient and can
            sustain a high volume of trading with a smaller inventory.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors snapping up a record pace of new corporate-bond
            sales may have muted trading of existing debt earlier this year,
            Alexander Sedgwick, head of research at MarketAxess Holdings
            Inc., said in a telephone interview. 'With low volatility,
            there hasn't been as much of an impetus up until the last couple
            weeks to move any money around,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A MarketAxess index that tracks the bid-ask spreads, or the
            difference between where bonds are bought and sold, for the
            1,000 largest and most actively traded issues widened to 10.5
            basis points on July 15 from 7.5 on April 29, according to the
            data from the electronic bond-trading platform owner. Over a
            five-month period ended Sept. 19, 2011, as markets were being
            roiled by concern a Greece default would jeopardize Europe's
            common currency, the spread widened to 15.6 from 8.5, the data
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Since the crisis, we've generally run portfolios with
            higher levels of liquidity, knowing that the markets were going
            to be more volatile and we want to be able to be nimble,' said
            Ashish Shah, the head of global credit at AllianceBernstein
            Holding LP, which oversees $257 billion in fixed-income assets.
            'That lesson still holds. You can't give up that liquidity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Credit Benchmarks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost to protect against
            corporate-bond losses in the U.S. fell to a seven-week low after
            Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said central bank plans to curtail
            stimulus could be delayed if the economy weakens. Honda Motor
            Co. sold $1.5 billion of bonds backed by auto loans after
            increasing the offering's size by $500 million. Harbor Freight
            Tools USA Inc. set the rate it will pay on a $1 billion
            covenant-light term loan it's seeking to refinance debt and
            support a dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were the most actively
            traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers
            yesterday, accounting for 4 percent of the volume of dealer
            trades of $1 million or more, according to Trace, the bond-price
            reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets sold $2.5 billion of
            2.9 percent, five-year notes on July 16, Bloomberg data show.
            The securities rose 0.2 cent from the issue price to 100.1 cents
            on the dollar to yield 2.87 percent, according to Trace. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rate Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
            debt-market stress, increased 0.4 basis point to 17.45 basis
            points. The gauge typically widens when investors seek the
            perceived safety of government securities and narrows when they
            favor assets such as company debentures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
            to speculate on creditworthiness, declined 2.1 basis points to a
            mid-price of 75.9 basis points, the lowest since May 28,
            according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed's $85 billion of monthly asset purchases that have
            been bolstering credit markets aren't on a 'preset course,'
            Bernanke said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're going to be responding to the data,' the Fed
            chairman said in testimony before the House Financial Services
            Committee. 'If the data are stronger than we expect, we'll move
            more quickly' to reduce purchases, he said. If data 'don't
            meet the kinds of expectations we have about where the economy's
            going, then we would delay that process or potentially increase
            purchases for a time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Honda Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Europe Index, tied to 125 companies with
            investment-grade ratings, dropped 1.1 to 104.2 at 9:59 a.m. in
            London. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Markit iTraxx Asia index
            of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan slid 4 to 133. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The credit-swaps indexes typically fall as investor
            confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. A basis point
            equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
            debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A top-ranked $458 million portion of Honda's offering
            maturing in 2.1 years yields 27 basis points more than the
            benchmark swap rate, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index
            rose for an eighth day, climbing 0.07 cent to 98.18 cents on the
            dollar. That's the longest stretch of increases for the measure,
            which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien
            leveraged loans, since it rose for 17 days ended May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Harbor Freight &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3
            by Moody's Investors Service and lower than BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harbor Freight, the tool and equipment retailer, is
            proposing to pay interest at 4 percentage points more than the
            London interbank offered rate, with a 1 percent minimum on the
            lending benchmark, according to a person with knowledge of the
            transaction who asked not to be identified because terms are
            private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In emerging markets, relative yields narrowed 6 basis
            points to 336 basis points, or 3.36 percentage points, according
            to JPMorgan's EMBI Global index. The gauge has fallen from a
            one-year high of 395.3 on June 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Primary dealers cut their holdings of securities including
            corporate bonds, commercial paper, and mortgage-backed debt by
            76 percent to $56 billion at the end of March from a peak of
            $235 billion in October 2007, New York Fed data show. The banks
            pared positions in investment-grade corporate bonds to $6.3
            billion as of July 3, from $13.5 billion on May 29, according to
            data the Fed started releasing in a reformatted version in
            April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Paring Positions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks pared the holdings as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in
            the U.S. seeks to limit the risks lenders take with their own
            money and the 27-country Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
            raises minimum capital standards. The Fed figures overstate how
            much banks were keeping in inventories to facilitate trading,
            according to the JPMorgan analysts, who attributed most of the
            decline to proprietary trading desks scaling back or closing to
            comply with the new rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Broker-dealers are now focused on trading on behalf of
            clients, rather than taking positions wagering on the direction
            of the market, JPMorgan's Panigirtzoglou said. While the total
            number of dealers has declined since the crisis, new market
            participants from electronic trading platforms to non-bank
            trading firms have balanced the pool, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Electronic Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is not only traditional broker-dealers who provide
            inventory for market making, but other non-traditional players
            are now providing their own inventory,' Panigirtzoglou said in
            an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are turning to electronic platforms to 'access
            more fragmented liquidity' and reach more trading partners,
            Richard Prager, BlackRock Inc.'s head of trading and liquidity
            strategies, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, teamed with
            MarketAxess to create a unified bond-trading platform, routing
            trades on their Aladdin Trading Network through MarketAxess.
            About 12 percent of high-grade corporate bonds tracked by Trace
            were traded on MarketAxess in the first quarter, up from less
            than 6 percent in the same period of 2009, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An investor's expectation of what they can move has
            changed,' Prager said. 'You have to work harder now to get
            trades done; and the bigger amounts, you have to be more patient
            because the liquidity isn't there.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Paradigm &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market rout last month was fueled largely by sales of
            the easiest-to-trade securities as investors hewed to what
            Prager calls the 'new liquidity paradigm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You buy something because you think it's really very
            liquid, and you actually end up suffering in a selloff because
            investors end up selling what they can,' said Bank of America's
            Mikkelsen. 'If interest rates rise too rapidly again, you don't
            want to hold the most liquid stuff because that's what gets
            liquidated.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank bonds, the most liquid corporate debt, were sold first
            by investors, exacerbating losses in that corner of the market,
            Mikkelsen said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold bank bonds
            rather than similar-maturity government securities widened as
            much as 48 basis points to 187 basis points on June 24 from a
            more than five-year low on May 22, according to Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch's U.S. Banking Corporate index. That compares with
            a 31 basis-point increase to as high as 172 for the average
            high-grade corporate bond, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            U.S. Corporate Index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was reassuring to see the amount of liquidity that was
            actually available,' largely offered by institutional money
            managers, said AllianceBernstein's Shah. 'You're getting paid
            to provide liquidity as an investor in the same way that dealers
            used to be paid to provide liquidity, just to put up their own
            capital.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Russian Stocks Cut to Sell at JPMorgan on U.S. Sanctions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. recommended
            investors sell Russian equities, citing the latest round of U.S.
            sanctions over Ukraine as the catalyst, after saying last month
            that it was time to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts including Adrian Mowat cut the rating to
            underweight, the equivalent of sell, from overweight on the
            escalation of geopolitical tension, stronger international
            sanctions along with declining oil prices, according to an e-mailed note to clients. The bank raised its
            recommendation on
            Russian stocks last month, citing the 'fading' of the Ukraine
            crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The downgrade follows a 4.2 drop in the benchmark Micex
            Index over the past two days since the U.S. Treasury imposed new
            penalties on Russian companies and after the ruble yesterday
            tumbled the most since 2011. A Malaysian Airlines jet was shot
            down yesterday over eastern Ukraine killing all 298 people on
            board. The government in Kiev blames pro-Russian rebels for the
            attack on flight MH17. The separatists deny the accusation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Market volatility is currently driven by geopolitics,'
            the analysts wrote in today's note. 'U.S. financial sanctions
            and now the MH17 are substantive events that have escalated
            tensions further.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan in Rules Dispute Cedes Loan Share to Nonbanks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the behemoths of the U.S. mortgage market, are
            surrendering more business to nonbank lenders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nation's two largest originators made
            21 percent of home loans in the second quarter, the smallest combined share in more than a decade, down from
            30 percent a year ago, according to regulatory filings. They're ceding ground to companies like Quicken
            Loans Inc., which grabbed the No. 3 spot from Bank of America Corp. in the first quarter, and LoanDepot.com
            LLC, whose share surged more than three-fold in the following period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big banks are
            exercising caution to avoid losses if their home loans sour and government-controlled Fannie Mae or Freddie
            Mac force them to repurchase the mortgages. This week, JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon escalated the buyback issue
            between lenders and the government, saying he questioned whether his bank should end its decades-old
            relationship with the Federal Housing Administration, a last resort for lower-income Americans seeking
            mortgages. Nonbank lenders, hungry for mortgages to service, are expanding rapidly to fill the void left by
            banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Mortgage banking may just be a smaller players' game now,' said Paul Miller, a
            banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia. 'They're able to be more flexible.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the No. 2 U.S. mortgage lender, reported this week that its second-quarter
            originations fell 66 percent to $16.8 billion, the lowest quarterly result since at least 2005, compared
            with the year-ago period. The New York-based bank's share of the market dropped to 5.4 percent in the second
            quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, from 8.1 percent in the first period. JPMorgan's market
            share averaged 10 percent in the prior five years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Threat &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much
            of the decline came from a falloff in FHA lending, Dimon said on the bank's call with analysts. Banks have
            been in a dispute with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA over rules that force the firms to repurchase
            mortgages that go bad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our FHA volume was way down and we studied FHA and based upon
            the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that we've lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA,' Dimon said.
            'The real question to me is should we be in the FHA business at all and we're still struggling with that.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's loss of market share is part of its long-term plan to pull back from the
            mortgage business and focus on making loans to the most creditworthy borrowers, said Miller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wells
            Drops &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They're making a strategic decision to shrink,' Miller said. 'They don't want to
            do marginal loans they could end up paying the piper on. They're saying we paid a lot of money and we're
            done with it.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo last week reported that originations fell 58 percent to $47
            billion from a year earlier, the lowest second-quarter result in more than a decade. The San Francisco-based
            bank's market share declined to 15.2 percent in the second quarter, based on data compiled by Bloomberg,
            from 15.9 percent in the first period. The bank's share averaged 23 percent in the prior five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said on a conference call last week that the bank
            wants to lend to more borrowers even if they don't have pristine credit. He said Wells Fargo just needs
            clarity about what triggers a buyback demand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank executives are having meetings with
            Melvin L. Watt, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, about the rules, Stumpf said. FHFA
            oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, known as government-sponsored enterprises. Earlier this year, Watt
            introduced a sunset provision so lenders are not responsible in some cases if loans go sour after three
            years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;LoanDepot Advantage &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You have low rates on one side
            encouraging borrowing and you have put-backs from the GSEs on the other side that make lenders less willing
            to lend money,' Stumpf said. 'The goal is to get more credit appropriately to borrowers who want to own
            homes and who can afford homes.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonbank lenders like LoanDepot.com that started after
            the housing crash in 2007 or didn't make subprime loans are not burdened with the buyback issue, said
            Anthony Hsieh, chief executive officer of LoanDepot.com. The online lender, which is backed by
            private-equity firm Parthenon Capital Partners, began in 2010 in compliance with new mortgage regulations
            compared with established banks that had to adapt to the changes, Hsieh said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We had a
            clean canvas to build our organization post crisis in a new world of much heavier regulatory scrutiny,' said
            Hsieh, a former president of LendingTree.com. 'The biggest banks have a much smaller footprint than before
            and that creates a lot of opportunity for nonbank lenders.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Share Soars &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LoanDepot.com, which collects payments on the majority of mortgages it makes, originated $3 billion
            in loans in the second quarter, a 58 percent jump from a year earlier, according to Hsieh. The Foothill
            Ranch, California-based firm's market share rose more than threefold to 1.1 percent in the second period,
            Hsieh said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hsieh said the firm is selling products that are compliant with qualified
            mortgage guidelines, such as debt-to-income ratios below 43 percent. The company will soon announce an
            offering for loans without government backing to help sustain its rapid growth, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stonegate
            Mortgage Corp. (SGM), which was founded by Jim Cutillo and his wife Barbara in 2005, survived the subprime
            meltdown by avoiding these risky loans. The Indianapolis-based firm has been ratcheting up its market share
            by expanding to states such as California and Virginia, said Cutillo, who was a director for GMAC
            Residential Funding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wholesale Business &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender and servicer,
            whose biggest investor is private-equity firm Long Ridge Equity Partners, last year hired a team from
            Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. to expand its wholesale business -- lending through mortgage brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's mortgage origination volume, which includes FHA loans, jumped 27 percent to $2.4
            billion in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Cutillo plans to build the firm's business in
            jumbo loans in places like Washington with more expensive real estate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If all the big
            players were deconsolidating and some small and mid-sized players didn't have enough capital to build size
            and scale in any industry, wouldn't you think there would be a huge opportunity?' Cutillo said. 'We're
            arbitraging that and filling a big void the banks have left.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Refinance Plunge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaza Home Mortgage Inc. mostly provides wholesale lending -- a business that banks like Wells
            Fargo exited. Plaza Home Mortgage has been able to increase its originations by working with brokers who
            focus on purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's paid off as refinancing has waned, said Kevin Parra, Plaza's
            co-founder. Refinancing, a traditional mainstay for banks, fell in April to the lowest level since 2008,
            according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The San Diego-based firm benefits from
            established relationships with mortgage brokers who in turn work with local realtors, Parra said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As the market has moved from refis to purchases, service becomes a bigger factor, and brokers will
            use us because they know us and trust we will get them to close on time,' said Parra. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plaza
            Home originated $1 billion in mortgages for purchases in the second quarter compared with $780 million a
            year earlier, and increased its total market share to 0.6 percent, said Parra. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            market-share gain of small lenders is increasing financial risks for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according
            to a report yesterday from the FHFA's Office of Inspector General. The companies, which were on the brink of
            insolvency in 2008 and seized by the government, buy mortgages from lenders and package them into securities
            that are sold to investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Limited Capacity' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Some smaller
            lenders and nonbank mortgage companies have limited financial capacity,' the report said. If loans later
            prove to have errors in them, the companies may lack the ability to make good on buyback demands, resulting
            in losses for taxpayers, it said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have recovered almost $100
            billion from lenders stemming from buyback demands since the 2008 financial crisis, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks may focus more on mortgage lending once there's more clarity around buybacks and the housing
            recovery regains momentum, said Hsieh of LoanDepot.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Wells will always be the 800
            pound gorilla, but the nonbank upstarts will make headway and some will be here to stay,' said FBR's Miller.

        <headline>U.K. Hires JPMorgan to Provide Bank-Privatization Advice</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM),
            whose senior advisers include former Prime Minister Tony Blair,
            as it accelerates efforts to reduce its stakes in Lloyds Banking
            Group Plc (LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan Cazenove will provide ad hoc input which will
            complement UKFI's expertise in devising strategies for realizing
            value for the government's shareholdings in the banks,' U.K.
            Financial Investments Ltd., the body that oversees the
            government's stakes in the lenders, said in a statement today.
            'This appointment does not involve any commitment in relation
            to other roles at any other time and UKFI intends to review this
            appointment on a periodic basis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UKFI also named a panel of 11 banks including Barclays Plc (BARC)
            and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. eligible to be selected as
            bookrunners in future stock offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said last month
            the U.K. government is 'actively considering' selling shares
            in Lloyds. RBS's return to private ownership is still some way
            off because it's weighed down by too many poor assets, he told
            financiers in his Mansion House speech in London on June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyds shares exceed the level at which the government says
            it will break even on its 39 percent holding after providing a
            20 billion-pound ($30 billion) rescue almost five years ago. The
            stock was down 1 percent at 69.34 pence by 11:26 a.m. in London,
            surpassing the 61 pence break-even price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Osborne said last month the first block of government
            shares in Lloyds will probably be sold to institutional
            investors as 'the most effective way of managing risk and
            getting value.' The government will consider an offering to
            individual investors at a later stage, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBS is trading at 336.8 pence, below the 407 pence the
            Treasury says it will break even on its 45.5 billion-pound
            investment in the 81 percent government-owned lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following is a list of prequalified service providers: &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Risk Committee Cut in Half as Futter, Cote Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co., the largest
            U.S. bank, said Ellen V. Futter and David M. Cote, two of the
            firm's four risk-committee members, left the board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural
            History, is leaving after 16 years with the bank, while
            Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Chief Executive Officer Cote, 62,
            is retiring after more than five, the New York-based firm said
            yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cote and Futter were among three risk committee members who
            narrowly won re-election to the board in May, overcoming
            opposition from some shareholders after a London unit's loss of
            more than $6 billion exposed risk-management failures. None of
            the three had worked at a bank or as financial risk managers,
            Bloomberg News reported in May 2012. A fourth was added to the
            committee after the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am proud to have served as a member of JPMorgan Chase's
            board during such a historic time,' Futter, 63, said in the
            statement. She was the only director who didn't attend the
            annual shareholder meeting in May. She was re-elected with 53
            percent of the vote, the smallest margin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think she just got tired of the criticism,' John H. Biggs, who served as a JPMorgan director
            with Futter until 2007,
            said in an interview. 'She was long on judgment but short on
            technical knowledge, and that's OK by me.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ibovespa Futures Drop as JPMorgan Says Brazil Growth Disappoints</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ibovespa futures dropped, a sign the
            stock gauge may pare its biggest weekly gain in 10 months, as
            JPMorgan Chase Co. reaffirmed its sell recommendation on
            Brazilian equities, citing 'disappointing' growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MPX Energia SA (MPXE3), the energy company controlled by
            billionaire Eike Batista, may be active after Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. recommended buying the stock. Homebuilder Helbor
            Empreendimentos SA (HBOR3) may move after saying booked sales dropped 20
            percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August fell 0.4
            percent to 47,330 at 9:21 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The gauge is up 4.7
            percent this week, the most since the week ending on Sept. 14.
            The real climbed 0.2 percent to 2.2233 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Disappointment remains the norm' when it comes to
            Brazil's growth outlook, JPMorgan strategist Emy Shayo wrote in
            a note to clients today. 'We don't expect much improvement
            going forward as neither the global scenario nor the local
            economic policy guidance is likely to change.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts covering Brazil have reduced their 2013 growth
            forecast for nine straight weeks, most recently cutting it to
            2.31 percent in a bank survey of about 100 economists released
            earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ibovespa has slumped 22 percent this year through
            yesterday, wiping out $230 billion from the value of Brazilian
            equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil's main
            equity gauge trades at 11.9 times analysts' earnings estimates
            for the next four quarters, compared with 10.3 for the MSCI
            Emerging Markets Index of 21 developing nations' equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.91 billion
            reais yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.78
            billion reais this year through July 17, according to data
            compiled by the exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yuan, Rupee Declines May Diverge from Won Gains, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;China's yuan may fall versus the
            dollar on slowing economic growth and a current-account
            financing shortfall may spark further rupee weakness, while
            South Korea's currency has 'supportive buffers,' according to
            JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product in China may expand about 7.4
            percent this year and 7.2 percent in 2014, compared with a
            previous forecast of 7.6 percent and 7.7 percent, JPMorgan said
            today in a report. The world's second-biggest-economy's currency
            may 'end mostly flat if not even slightly weaker than current
            levels,' on export weakness and slowing growth, the New York-based firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yuan rose 0.04 percent to 6.1385 per dollar today in
            Shanghai, China Foreign Exchange Trade System prices show. That
            is up from 6.2306 at the end of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's $25 billion current-account-deficit 'has emerged
            because of a likely permanent worsening of the emerging-market
            funding landscape,' JPMorgan said. The gap developed as the
            U.S. Federal Reserve has debated winding down its asset purchase
            program that has driven down interest rates and pushed investors
            into higher yield assets, including those of emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While policy makers in India have sought to stem currency
            depreciation through intervention and regulatory changes,
            'policy options are largely limited to helping manage a more
            orderly depreciation trend of the rupee rather than being able
            to stop or reverse the trend,' according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Materially Stronger' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee rose 0.6 percent to 59.35 per dollar after
            touching a record low of 61.2125 on July 8. The currency
            rebounded as the Reserve Bank of India announced measures to
            curb speculation and boost returns on local-currency assets. The
            currency may weaken to 62 by the end of the year, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The risk of outflows from South Korea's won 'is
            considerably lower compared to other Asian peers,' according to
            the JPMorgan report. The nation's 12-month, rolling current-account surplus doubled, reaching its highest
            since 1999, the
            bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won, which trades at about 20 percent below the average
            of its Asian peers, will end the year 'materially stronger'
            versus the dollar and yen, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currency rose 0.4 percent to 1,121.75 per dollar in
            Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;

            at historically low levels until an uneven economy begins to
            normalize and there's a steady increase in inflation, JPMorgan
            Chase Co.'s John Normand said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors 'have just a lot of reservations about the
            durability of the expansion,' said Normand, JPMorgan Chase's
            London-based head of foreign-exchange and international rates
            strategy, in an interview on Bloomberg Radio's 'Surveillance'
            with Tom Keene and Michael McKee. 'Eventually, people's fears
            will be relieved if we can go through two or three quarters of
            decent growth in the U.S. But it's a very slow and tedious
            process.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell three basis
            points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.46 percent today in New
            York. They averaged 3.40 percent over the past decade, reaching
            a high of 5.32 percent in June 2007 and a low of 1.38 percent in
            July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Normand said that, taking a 'very simplistic' approach to
            calculations, the 10-year yield may approach 4 percent in a
            normalized economy, figuring 2 percent economic growth in real
            terms and 2 percent inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You're not going to get there in one month or one quarter
            or even one year,' Normand said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve will probably raise interest rates for
            the first time since 2006 once inflation stays around 2 percent
            for two to three quarters, Normand said. Projections for higher
            consumer prices won't be needed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You just need a move to, say, two-ish, or sticking at two
            for a while before it begins to look like central banks have
            money too easily priced,' Normand said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation, the personal
            consumption expenditures deflator, has failed to reach the
            bank's 2 percent target for more than two years. It rose to 1.8
            percent in May. The central bank has maintained the benchmark
            rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Haniel Said to Hire JPMorgan to Explore Celesio Options</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Franz Haniel Cie GmbH, a family-owned holding company in Germany, is exploring options including
            a sale of its entire stake in German pharmaceutical retailer
            Celesio AG (CLS1), according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Haniel has hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to advise on the sale
            of a full or partial stake or a partnership with another
            company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
            talks are private. The process remains at an early stage and
            Haniel could decide against a sale of its 50 percent stake in
            the Stuttgart-based company, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Celesio shares surged 9.3 percent to 17.70 euros at the
            close in Frankfurt, the biggest gain in a month. The stock has
            climbed 36 percent so far this year, giving the company a market
            value of 3 billion euros ($4 billion), amid speculation the
            company could be sold. Celesio Chief Executive Officer Markus Pinger was fired this month after he hired
            Citigroup Inc. to
            advise on a potential deal, people familiar with the situation
            said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since Walgreen Co. (WAG), the largest U.S. drugstore chain,
            agreed in 2012 to buy a 45 percent stake of U.K. pharmacy owner
            Alliance Boots, drug wholesalers have been examining their
            positions in Europe and ways to reduce costs. A possible Celesio
            sale comes as medical expenses rise and governments cut spending
            in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Potential Suitors &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Celesio has attracted interest from at least three
            companies, one of the people said. McKesson Corp. (MCK), the largest
            U.S. drug distributor, and U.S. competitor Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH)
            are among potential buyers, one of the people said. Celesio and
            CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) have held talks on a possible collaboration,
            including purchasing pacts, rather than an acquisition, the
            person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Haniel spokesman in Duisburg, Germany, said it's company
            policy not to comment on market speculation. Representatives of
            Celesio, JPMorgan and CVS Caremark declined to comment. McKesson
            and Cardinal Health couldn't be immediately reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Picks Lakos-Bujas as Head of U.S. Equity Strategy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. named Dubravko Lakos-Bujas as the head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy,
            assuming the role last held by Thomas Lee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lakos-Bujas will lead a team of analysts in
            covering the broad stock market and use mathematical models to analyze trends and find trading opportunities
            for JPMorgan clients. He will continue to report to Marko Kolanovic, global head of macro derivative and
            systematic strategies, according to a statement from the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            strategist joins almost two dozen Wall Street forecasters who try to predict the direction of the stock
            market and advise investors on their equity holdings. The average estimate for the year-end level of the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index is 1,986, based on a Bloomberg News survey of banks and brokerages, implying the
            equity benchmark will be little changed from now to December. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lakos-Bujas has worked as
            a quantitative analyst focusing on global markets at JPMorgan and spent six years at Deutsche Bank AG's
            asset management division, according to the statement from JPMorgan. He was third-ranked quantitative
            analyst in Institutional Investor's survey last year. Lee, who held the job since 2007, left earlier this
            year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Cohen's Point72 Hires Scott Braunstein From JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Point72 Asset Management LP, the
            firm that manages billionaire Steven A. Cohen's money after he
            shut down hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP, hired Scott Braunstein from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset
            management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Braunstein, 50, joins as a money manager and will work with
            Anna Yaeger at the firm's EverPoint Asset Management LLC unit in
            New York, according to an employee memo sent today. He spent 12
            years at JPMorgan Asset Management covering healthcare stocks
            with a focus on biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. Braunstein is
            the brother of JPMorgan's vice chairman and former Chief
            Financial Officer Doug Braunstein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohen, who is worth $11 billion, according to the Bloomberg
            Billionaire's Index, closed SAC Capital after the firm agreed
            last year to pay a record $1.8 billion and plead guilty to
            securities fraud to settle allegations of insider trading. His
            Stamford, Connecticut-based firm has suffered from departures of
            money managers, including Gabriel Plotkin, who plans to leave
            this year to start his own hedge-fund firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Point72 at Sard
            Verbinnen Co., declined to comment on the memo. A message left
            at Braunstein's home phone wasn't immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fund Co-Manager &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, Braunstein was a co-portfolio manager of its
            Global Healthcare Fund with Anne Marden. The fund, which started
            in October 2009, returned an annual average 24 percent in the
            past five years, beating 86 percent of rivals. Braunstein told
            New York-based JPMorgan in June that he was quitting, according
            to a statement on the company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before JPMorgan, Braunstein worked at Deutsche Bank AG and
            was previously a doctor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine
            and Cornell University, according to the employee memo. He
            starts at Point72 in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investments in healthcare stocks was one of the areas that
            led to the criminal charges against former money managers at SAC
            Capital. Mathew Martoma, this year was found guilty of using
            tips about drug trials to profit in what prosecutors described
            as the biggest insider trading case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohen's firm said in March that it hired Kimberlee Frasso
            as a compliance officer focusing on health care, and in April
            added Vincent Tortorella as chief surveillance officer. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Aussie May Fall to 3-Year Low, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar may fall to
            its lowest level in almost three years against its U.S.
            counterpart after failing to breach key technical levels of
            resistance, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aussie may decline to 87.75 per U.S. dollar, its
            weakest level since Aug. 25, 2010, after bouncing off the
            resistance zone from 93.05 to 93.45, according to Niall O'Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at
            JPMorgan.
            Australia's legal tender increased to 93.20 today before erasing
            its gain. The Aussie has been the worst-performing major
            currency over the past three months, decreasing 11 percent
            versus the greenback. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fact that we held that area near 93 today highlights
            the potential risk of additional weakness,' O'Connor said in a
            telephone interview. 'We could see some downside follow-through. The overall setup is still bearish.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's currency depreciated 1.7 percent, the most in a
            month, to 91.39 U.S. cents at 1:37 p.m. in New York after
            earlier gaining as much as 0.3 percent to 93.20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aussie may appreciate to 94.40, a more than one-month
            high, if it breaks through resistance at 93.45, O'Connor said.
            That would be the currency's strongest level since June 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If it happened to rally to about 93.45, that would be a
            positive short-term development,' O'Connor said. 'But it does
            look like that's unlikely to happen given what we've seen in
            recent price action.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aussie's 8.8 percent decline this year trails just the
            yen's 11 percent depreciation as the worst performing currency
            among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
            Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has gained the most with
            a 5 percent climb. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
            of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
            currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
            sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
            may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Debt-Trading Clients Widen Business as JPMorgan Leads Survey</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) had the biggest
            U.S. fixed-income market share as trading clients expand the
            number of dealers they do business with, Greenwich Associates
            said in an annual survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which held the top spot in a similar survey in
            2011 before dropping to third last year, has an 11.4 percent
            market share, Greenwich Associates said today, citing a study it
            conducted based on interviews with 1,027 active institutional
            investors in the U.S. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) dropped to fifth
            from second last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buy-side clients are spreading their business as Wall
            Street banks are scaling back in product areas in which they
            aren't leaders, Greenwich said. Banks including Morgan Stanley (MS)
            and UBS AG (UBSN) are shedding assets in fixed-income trading and
            seeking to cut costs amid sluggish revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For many institutional investors, these strategic shifts
            have resulted in disruptions in sell-side coverage and a
            reduction in market liquidity as dealers pull back capital,
            consolidate desks, reduce headcount and replace senior fixed-income professionals with younger, less
            experienced and cheaper
            talent,' Stamford, Connecticut-based Greenwich said in the
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
            had the three largest market shares behind JPMorgan. Greenwich
            said the four firms were in a statistical tie for first. The
            study focused on activity with clients, rather than trading
            revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Revenue Up &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nine largest banks generated about $90 billion in
            fixed-income trading revenue globally in 2012, excluding some
            accounting charges, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            That was up 14 percent from 2011, and accounted for more than
            half of all revenue from trading and investment banking at the
            firms, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, has the largest market
            share in trading rate products such as government bonds and
            interest-rate derivatives, according to Greenwich. Deutsche
            Bank, JPMorgan and Citigroup (C) joined the Swiss bank in a
            statistical tie. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had the biggest share in
            credit products, such as corporate bonds and leveraged loans.
            Barclays Plc (BARC), Credit Suisse and Bank of America had the largest
            share in securitized products, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup was the share leader in municipal bonds, with New
            York-based JPMorgan and Citigroup leading in emerging-market
            trading, Greenwich said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The study took place between February and April, Greenwich
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Heidelberg Gains as JPMorgan Cites U.S. Market Presence</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;HeidelbergCement AG (HEI), the world's
            third-largest maker of cement, rose the most in more than two
            months after JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said the company's presence in
            Europe and the U.S. may protect it from emerging-market
            'headwinds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HeidelbergCement increased as much as 4 percent to 55.43
            euros, the steepest intraday gain since May 7, and was trading
            up 2 percent at 4:30 p.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the company at
            10.2 billion euros ($13.5 billion). Trading volume exceeded the
            three-month daily average by 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cement producer, which is based in Heidelberg, Germany,
            generated more than half of revenue in 2012 from Western
            economies, with 30 percent from northwestern Europe and 25
            percent from North America. The World Bank cut its global
            economic-growth forecast for 2013 last month after emerging
            markets from China to Brazil slowed more than projected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Heidelberg is our preferred play in the cement sector,'
            as competitors Holcim Ltd. and Paris-based Lafarge SA (LG) are
            'largely exposed to emerging markets,' Elodie Rall, Emily Biddulph and Rajesh Patki, London-based analysts
            at JPMorgan,
            wrote in a research report published late yesterday.
            HeidelbergCement is 'rightly positioned through its U.S.
            exposure and western Europe to deliver' on estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on HeidelbergCement to
            overweight from neutral and estimate the stock will reach 57.30
            euros. The bank rates Holcim and Lafarge as neutral, saying
            more-optimistic industry analysts are 'relying too much on
            cost-saving deliveries to offset the current headwinds from
            weakening emerging markets' that confront the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heidelberg's stock has gained 19 percent this year, beating
            gains of 0.7 percent at Lafarge and 3 percent at Jona,
            Switzerland-based Holcim. &lt;/p&gt;

            more than the $4.5 billion it offered to settle investor claims
            over faulty mortgages packaged into securities before the U.S.
            housing crash, a report prepared for bond trustees shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trustees should reject the accord struck last November with
            a group of bondholders for 16 of the 330 deals included, and
            it's a 'close call' for three others, according to the report
            posted online this week by Daniel Fischel, president of Compass
            Lexecon, which is among firms hired by the securities
            administrators to help evaluate the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Based on the reports by the expert advisors, there exists
            a meaningful possibility that trustees may not accept the
            proposed settlement offer for all 330 trusts,' Nomura Holdings
            Inc. analysts including Paul Nikodem and Pratik K. Gupta wrote
            yesterday in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan negotiated the proposed settlement with 21
            institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Pacific
            Investment Management Co. in a bid to move past legal troubles
            tied in part to the housing crisis. The accord was announced the
            week before the largest U.S. bank agreed to a record $13 billion
            settlement with government agencies over faulty mortgage
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Extended Deadline &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trustees including Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo Co. and
            Bank of New York Mellon Corp. must decide whether to accept
            JPMorgan's proposal by Aug. 1. The deadline has been pushed back
            at least twice from an original date of March 16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment, as did Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo, Kevin Heine of Bank of New York and Renee Calabro of
            Deutsche Bank.
            Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs Bruns LLP representing the
            investors who negotiated the deal, didn't immediately respond to
            an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to
            continue separate lawsuits over some of the securities. Law firm
            Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Sullivan LLP is also representing a
            group of investors objecting to the agreement for at least some
            deals, according to Fischel, also a professor of law and
            business emeritus at the University of Chicago Law School. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Improper Servicing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord sparked claims that JPMorgan and Bear Stearns
            Cos., which it bought in 2008, needed to repurchase mortgages
            whose quality was misrepresented, as well as pay for mishandling
            loans once they're made. Another expert, Boston Portfolio
            Advisors Inc., said in its report the improper servicing boosted
            losses by $4 billion and disclosed that many of the loans are
            already managed by a separate 'subservicer,' limiting the
            benefits to investors of transfers to such entities as called
            for by the deal, according to Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank, has
            faced opposition in court over an $8.5 billion settlement that
            it reached in 2011 with bondholders represented by Gibbs Bruns
            and Bank of New York, as the trustee for more than 500
            transactions. A New York state judge largely approved the deal
            in January, though the ruling is being appealed by investors
            seeking a bigger payout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said this month it
            would pay $650 million to American International Group Inc., one
            of the objectors to the agreement that had also filed a separate
            suit over mortgage securities created by Countrywide Financial
            Corp., the lender bought by Bank of America in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No 'Windfall' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the proposed JPMorgan settlement is relatively small,
            compared with other mortgage-bond agreements, evidence from
            markets suggest that it wouldn't be a 'windfall' for the bank,
            Fischel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount offered represents 6.6 percent of past and
            potential losses on loans underlying the bonds, compared with
            10.8 percent in the Bank of America deal, Barclays Plc analysts
            estimated in November. After a $55 million payment by Wells
            Fargo to an individual bond trust this year, investors recovered
            32 percent of past and future losses, according to Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fatan Sabry, an economist at National Economic Research
            Associates Inc., wrote in a report for trustees that JPMorgan's
            planned payment exceeds potential losses from violations of so-called representation and warranties under
            several estimation
            methods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anthony J. Carpinello, a former New York State Supreme
            Court justice, said in a report that the statute of limitations
            for all the 330 deals has been extended, which could bolster any
            separate demands from investors reluctant to take part in the
            accord, according to Nomura. JPMorgan contends that the
            extension only applies to some of the deals, according to a
            website set up by trustees. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley to JPMorgan Said to Keep Trading With SAC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan (JPM)
            Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley are among Wall Street banks
            continuing to trade with SAC Capital Advisors LP after U.S.
            prosecutors indicted the hedge fund for insider trading,
            according to four people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms are still providing trading and prime brokerage
            services to the hedge fund founded by Steven A. Cohen, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified talking about a specific
            client. The government has no plan to freeze fund assets,
            prevent redemptions or affect interests of SAC counterparties,
            Stamford, Connecticut-based SAC said yesterday after the
            government's criminal charges were made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have been grappling with the reputational and
            financial consequences of continuing their dealings with SAC,
            one of Wall Street's largest trading clients. The $14 billion
            hedge fund was indicted for perpetrating what prosecutors called
            an unprecedented insider-trading scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You're always between a rock and a hard place when you're
            the credit guy trying to decide to what to do,' said James Rickards, senior managing director at Tangent
            Capital Partners
            LLC and former general counsel at Long-Term Capital Management
            LP, which was one of the world's biggest hedge funds before
            losing $4 billion in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have to ask themselves 'what is the risk that I lose
            money? What is the risk that they get into stress and I don't
            get paid? What is the risk that the regulator criticizes me or
            my reputation is tarnished?' Rickards said. 'The other side is
            I like the commissions and I want to be a stand-up guy, and I
            don't want to be perceived as a guy who cut and run.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Protective Measures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's unclear whether other lenders including Goldman Sachs (GS)
            Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Citigroup Inc. (C) had changed any
            of their dealings with SAC. Spokesmen for the banks declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks may continue to deal with the hedge-fund firm while
            protecting themselves by reducing credit limits, requiring more
            collateral and halting trades in over-the-counter products, said
            Rickards, who was a credit officer at Greenwich Capital Markets
            when junk-bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. collapsed
            in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a lot of things you can do between doing nothing
            and cutting them off completely to improve your position,' said
            Rickards. 'If everyone hangs together, and everyone does some
            common-sense things, it's business as usual. But if one domino
            falls, the rest of them will fall very quickly, and that's why
            everyone is on eggshells.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Allegations Denied &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAC denied it encouraged or tolerated insider trading and
            said it will continue to operate as it works through the
            allegations. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed an
            administrative complaint against Cohen last week, seeking to ban
            him from overseeing investor funds for allegedly failing to
            supervise employees and prevent them from engaging in insider
            trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;No major financial-services firm has survived a criminal
            indictment in the U.S. While Cohen has vowed to keep open the
            most successful equity hedge-fund manager, clients have already
            pulled billions from its funds. SAC Capital said in a regulatory
            filing this week that it managed $13.9 billion of net assets as
            of July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hedge fund has been among the largest trading clients
            for New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs, according
            to people with knowledge of the relationships. SAC has used
            those firms, along with JPMorgan, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
            Barclays Plc (BARC), as prime brokers, Reuters reported in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reputational Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the world's biggest banks have been emphasizing
            their efforts to behave ethically, put clients first, cooperate
            with regulators and temper risk-taking after reputations were
            damaged during the credit crisis, government-funded bailouts and
            scandals throughout the financial industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is definitely reputational risk at this point that
            didn't exist before as a result of the indictment,' Rickards
            said. 'I know we're innocent until proven guilty, and I respect
            that, but there's no requirement that a counterparty be good to
            the last drop. You're allowed to make sensible business
            decisions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;EON SE (EOAN), Germany's largest utility,
            sold a stake in its Anacacho wind farm in Texas to JPMorgan
            Chase Co. for $76.6 million and a commitment for future
            funding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank bought a 'partial interest' and will make
            further capital contributions, EON Climate Renewables North
            America, a subsidiary of the Dusseldorf-based company, said in a
            statement today. Matt Tulis, an EON spokesman, declined to say
            how large a stake was sold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The tax-equity financing gives JPMorgan a share of the
            project's 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour production tax credit, Tulis
            said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 99-megawatt project, located in Kinney County, Texas,
            consists of 55 Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 1.8-megawatt turbines and
            started operating in December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused of Energy-Market Manipulation by U.S. Agency</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) manipulated power markets in California and the Midwest from September
            2010 to June 2011, obtaining tens of millions of dollars in overpayments from grid operators, the U.S.
            Federal Energy Regulatory Commission alleged today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agency said in a Notice of
            Alleged Violations that it had preliminarily determined a JPMorgan trading unit had engaged in eight
            manipulative bidding strategies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank has agreed to sanctions
            including a fine of about $400 million in a settlement that may be announced as early as tomorrow, according
            to a person familiar with the case who asked not to be identified because the terms aren't yet public. Other
            sanctions may include forfeiting profits, this person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan
            spokesman, declined to comment on the FERC action. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case marks another setback for
            the biggest U.S.-based bank, which sailed through the 2008 financial crisis without a single quarterly loss.
            Last year JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion from wrong-way derivatives bets placed by traders in London.
            The incident prompted a U.S. Senate investigation, the departure of two senior executives and a debate over
            whether Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon should keep his chairman role. In May shareholders re-elected
            him as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Cut Support Jobs Amid Trading Slump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. lender, is cutting hundreds of technology support
            employees in its corporate and investment bank amid a revenue decline, people with knowledge of the move
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Workers in locations including New York, Tampa, Chicago and Dubai were notified of
            the cuts this month, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren't authorized to
            discuss the matter. Luke Moranda, a managing director in charge of clearing technology, and Dan Cronin, an
            executive director, were among those let go, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms are
            trimming expenses by paring support employees and moving personnel to lower-cost locales amid a decline in
            fixed-income trading. JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, run by Daniel Pinto, posted a 12 percent
            revenue drop to $17.6 billion in the first six months of 2014, while noninterest expenses declined by 1.6
            percent to $11.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We continue to be focused and diligent on managing expenses

        <headline>JPMorgan Filed Inaccurate Large Trader Reports, CFTC Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will pay
            $650,000 to settle U.S. regulatory claims that the bank
            repeatedly filed inaccurate reports about its clients'
            derivatives trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's brokerage unit, JPMorgan Securities LLC, filed
            reports between 2012 and this year with hundreds of errors about
            clients' futures and options trades, the Commodity Futures
            Trading Commission said in a statement today. The unit continued
            to file inaccurate reports even after the agency flagged the
            errors to the bank, the CFTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The large trader reports are vital to the CFTC's role in
            monitoring market behavior,' Aitan Goelman, the CFTC's director
            of enforcement, said in the statement. 'The CFTC will be
            vigilant in enforcing these rules in order to ensure the
            integrity of the regulatory structure and to maintain
            transparency in the markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined immediate
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CFTC requires futures brokers to submit daily reports,
            which it uses to assess large traders' activities and to
            determine whether they hold speculative positions that exceed
            regulatory limits. The data is also included in weekly reports
            on aggregate market activities that are then disclosed to the
            public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been penalized for inaccurate trade reporting
            before. The firm was among at least three dealers to be
            sanctioned this year by the Financial Industry Regulatory
            Authority for not properly reporting trades to bond-price system
            known as Trace. The bank neglected to post trades or missed
            deadlines in at least 6,300 instances over a two-year period,
            Finra said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holding back information on trades can give Wall Street
            dealers an advantage over customers seeking a fair price,
            undermining Finra's stated goal of equal access for all
            participants to real-time data. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will pay $410 million to settle U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
            allegations that the bank manipulated power markets, enriching itself at the expense of consumers in
            California and the Midwest from 2010 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay a U.S. civil
            penalty of $285 million and return $125 million in ill-gotten profits to electricity ratepayers, according
            to a FERC order today. JPMorgan also agreed to give up claims to $262 million worth of disputed payments
            from California's grid operator, the state authority said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're
            pleased to have this matter behind us,' Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, the
            largest U.S. bank by market value, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case marks another
            setback for JPMorgan, which sailed through the 2008 financial crisis without a single quarterly loss. Last
            year JPMorgan lost more than $6.2 billion from wrong-way derivatives bets placed by traders in London. The
            incident prompted a U.S. Senate investigation, the departure of two senior executives and a debate over
            whether Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, should keep his chairman role. In May shareholders
            re-elected him as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;

            JPMorgan Chase Co. said July 26 it was considering the sale or spin off of its physical commodities
            business, including energy trading, three days after a congressional hearing examined whether banks are
            using their ownership of raw materials to manipulate markets. Close

        <headline>JPMorgan Energy Traders Spur Inquiries From Agencies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) energy traders
            who avoided individual penalties in a $410 million settlement
            with a federal regulator may face action by other agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal and state agencies are free to pursue penalties
            against the bank's employees if they choose, Jon Wellinghoff,
            chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said today
            in an interview. He said the FERC would cooperate with other
            agencies, which he didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have had some discussions with some agencies that I
            can't disclose at this time,' Wellinghoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by market value, agreed
            today to pay $410 million to resolve FERC accusations that its
            traders manipulated power markets in California and the Midwest
            from 2010 to 2012. The agency decided not to pursue sanctions
            against individuals, though it named them in the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The decision was made to move forward in this case from a
            standpoint of expeditiously settling the matter' not to punish
            individuals, Wellinghoff said. The FERC has previously reached
            agreements to end an investigation without sanctioning
            individuals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asked in a separate interview with Bloomberg Television
            today if he was aware of any investigations being conducted by
            other agencies, the FERC chairman said he knew of none. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan traders Francis Dunleavy, Andrew Kittell and John
            Bartholomew are still employed with the bank, according to the
            FERC settlement documents. They worked in JPMorgan's commodities
            unit, run by Blythe Masters, the FERC order showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lawful Conduct &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, Kittell and Bartholomew didn't settle with the
            commission. The agency decided not to sanction them after they
            explained to the commission that their conduct was lawful,
            according to a statement from Gibson, Dunn Crutcher LLP, the
            law firm representing them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The commission's decision to voluntarily settle with
            JPMorgan and not proceed against the individuals can only be
            read as the commission correctly concluding that no case or
            findings against the individuals could be sustained in a court
            of law,' William Scherman, their lawyer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He declined to comment on Wellinghoff's interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steven Greenlee, a spokesman for the California Independent
            System Operator, declined to comment whether the state grid
            authority was conducting its own investigation or has received
            any inquiries from government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC on July 16 announced $18 million in civil penalties
            for four former traders for Barclays Plc (BARC), over allegations of
            market manipulation. The sanctions were part of $488 million in
            fines and penalties levied at Barclays and the individuals,
            which the bank has vowed to fight. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Marathon Hires JPMorgan's Gold to Boost Emerging-Market Trading</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Marathon Asset Management LP, a
            hedge-fund operator that oversees more than $10.5 billion of
            assets, hired JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co.'s Jason Gold as it bolsters
            its emerging-markets trading effort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold, who focused on Latin American sovereign debt as a
            senior trader at JPMorgan, will join Marathon in September,
            according to Andrew Rabinowitz, the company's chief operating
            officer. Gold will be a senior trader based in New York and
            report to Gabriel Szpigiel, a partner and senior portfolio
            manager, Rabinowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
            comment. Gold couldn't be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marathon was founded in 1998 and specializes in global
            credit, including high-yield, bank, distressed and emerging-market bonds, along with structured finance,
            debt transactions
            and real estate. JPMorgan is the second-most-active underwriter
            of Latin American overseas bonds this year, managing about $7.5
            billion in offerings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The volume of dollar-denominated debt from emerging-market
            countries such as Russia, Mexico and Brazil has swelled by 69
            percent since 2008 to $444.2 billion outstanding, according to
            the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Emerging Markets External
            Debt Sovereign Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index has declined 6.4 percent this year after
            returning 77 percent in the four years after 2008, as central
            banks globally suppressed borrowing costs through bond purchases
            to ignite economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Don't Fight PBOC as Stimulus Lifts Stocks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Don't fight the People's Bank of China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's the advice to investors from
            Adrian Mowat, the Hong Kong-based chief Asia and emerging-market strategist at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) who
            raised his rating on Chinese stocks to neutral from underweight in a report dated yesterday. He said shares
            will rally through October after the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) entered a bull market on July
            28. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China's central bank presided over a bigger-than-estimated surge in new credit in
            June and has cut reserve requirements for some lenders, while local media reported the PBOC set up a 1
            trillion yuan ($162 billion) lending facility with the China Development Bank to fund housing projects. The
            signs of monetary easing, along with accelerated government spending and gains in manufacturing industries,
            have spurred mutual fund managers to boost Chinese stock holdings to record highs, according to a July 28
            report from HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The scale of monetary stimulus since June is a
            surprise,' Mowat wrote. 'All these changes indicate a more aggressive approach to driving growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mowat is joining bulls, including Standard Chartered Plc's Erwin Sanft and Templeton Emerging
            Markets Group's Mark Mobius, who predict the rally will extend as low valuations lure investors and the
            government supports growth. Bears such as Bank of America Corp.'s David Cui say stimulus is delaying the
            economy's shift toward a more sustainable model driven by consumption and services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Winning
            Streak &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell less than 0.1 percent to 11,119.32 at
            the close in Hong Kong, snapping a sixth straight day of gains. China's Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) of
            mainland shares slipped 0.1 percent, paring the biggest monthly advance since 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aggregate
            financing was 1.97 trillion yuan in June, the PBOC said on July 15, compared with the median estimate of
            analysts for 1.425 trillion yuan. New local-currency loans were 1.08 trillion yuan and M2 money supply grew
            14.7 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang said in June that authorities will
            'ensure' a minimum annual economic growth rate of 7.5 percent. China's manufacturing industries expanded at
            the fastest pace in 18 months in July, according to a preliminary purchasing managers' index from HSBC
            Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. Industrial companies reported a 17.9 percent gain in earnings in June
            from a year earlier, the fastest pace since September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors' sentiment on Chinese
            stocks has improved over the past few days amid speculation the economy will stabilize in coming quarters,
            Jason Sun and Minggao Shen, analysts at Citigroup Inc. (C), said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Zhou
            Probe &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ruling Communist Party's investigation into former security czar Zhou
            Yongkang could also provide a boost to equities, Lu Ting, head of Greater China economics at Bank of America
            Corp. (BAC) in Hong Kong, wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'With some high-profile arrests under
            its belt, we believe the focus of the new government can start to shift from the anti-graft campaign to real
            institutional reforms, which are badly needed for China's long-term economic health,' Lu said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Mowat, who cut Chinese stocks to underweight in October, recommends buying 'high beta'
            stocks including brokerages and property companies with low valuations, along with construction and railroad
            companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our China model portfolio is structured for a bull market, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Ferry to Head FX Compliance Team</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, named Andrew Ferry to lead a compliance team focused
            on foreign exchange and rates markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ferry, 46, who previously was in charge of swaps for
            Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was promoted to oversee the
            newly created team in London, said Brian Marchiony, a spokesman
            for the New York-based firm. Tom Prickett, formerly a senior
            trader in the Sterling swaps business, took over Ferry's earlier
            duties, Marchiony said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators and prosecutors in the U.S. and Britain are
            investigating allegations the world's biggest banks, including
            JPMorgan, colluded to rig the foreign-currency rates. JPMorgan
            also agreed this week to pay $650,000 to settle the Commodity
            Futures Trading Commission's claim that it repeatedly filed
            inaccurate reports about clients' derivatives trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ferry didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
            comment. The Wall Street Journal reported the moves earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Chinese Banks May See Profit Decline on Crackdown, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese banks' profits may decline
            in the next three years as a government crackdown on industrial
            overcapacity slows lending and sours loans, said JPMorgan
            Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit growth may slow to the mid-teens over the next 18
            months, from the 20 percent to 25 percent gains in recent years,
            Josh Klaczek, head of Asia financial services, told reporters in
            Hong Kong today. Klaczek didn't specify which bank could see
            earnings drop. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to curb overcapacity, which
            the government blames for driving down prices of goods, eroding
            company profits and generating pollution. Industrial
            Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398), China Construction Bank Corp. (939),
            Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (3988), and Bank of China Ltd. were
            among the world's five most profitable lenders last year, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Growth and profits would be increasingly challenged,'
            Klaczek said. 'Given the pressures we are seeing right now in
            terms of asset quality, in terms of slower revenue growth versus
            rising costs, and then on top of that potential interest rate
            liberalization, that's a recipe for earnings falling.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China this month eliminated the lower limit on lending
            rates offered by the nation's financial institutions as Li seeks
            to expand the role of markets in the economy, &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Social Financing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nine mainland banks trading in Hong Kong have been
            reporting consecutive annual profit growth since 2009 as the
            nation's stimulus program created a $2.7 trillion credit boom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Total social financing, which includes bank loans, bond and
            equity sales, as well as shadow banking, was 1.04 trillion yuan
            ($170 billion) in June, 13 percent less than the previous month,
            data from the People's Bank of China show. That compared with a
            56 percent gain in January, when credit increased by 2.5
            trillion yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Monthly social financing may be about 1 trillion yuan for
            the rest of 2013, Klaczek said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bad loans climbed by 33.6 billion yuan in the three months
            ended March 31, a sixth straight quarter it increased, data from
            the China Banking Regulatory Commission show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'China two years ago had way more capital than everyone
            else,' Klaczek said. 'I no longer think it's a case of
            overcapitalized. I think they are actually just at the line.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The expansion of non-performing loans will depress profit
            and curb the ability of banks to increase dividends, Klaczek
            said. If more loans sour, lenders may need to raise capital, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused by Siena Prosecutors in Monte Paschi Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Siena prosecutors accused JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and at least one of its employees of obstructing
            regulators as part of a wider probe into Banca Monte dei Paschi
            di Siena SpA's purchase of Banca Antonveneta SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege an unidentified person at JPMorgan
            Securities Ltd., a unit of the New York-based bank, withheld
            information from regulators about a 1 billion-euro ($1.3
            billion) financing arranged for Monte Paschi's takeover of
            Antonveneta in 2008, a July 30 court filing obtained by
            Bloomberg News showed. The U.S. bank failed to oversee its
            employees properly, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan arranged a sale of bonds exchangeable into shares
            of Monte Paschi to finance the deal. The lender, which benefited
            from the alleged crime by earning commissions, didn't inform the
            Bank of Italy that it signed a so-called indemnity agreement
            with Monte Paschi, protecting JPMorgan from potential losses
            linked to the securities, according to prosecutors. By hiding
            the agreement, Monte Paschi (BMPS) was able to count the funding as
            equity instead of debt and boost capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The documents mark the final stage before the authorities
            can request formal indictments, and it brings them a step closer
            to reconstructing how Monte Paschi's former managers allegedly
            colluded to misrepresent the lender's finances in the years
            before it sought a government bailout. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Commodity-Tied Note Sales Climb to Largest With Add-On</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $195
            million of structured notes tied to an index of commodity
            futures, the largest such note in more than three and a half
            years after the size was increased twice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four-year securities, $40 million of which were issued
            on July 23, yield the gains and losses of the Dow Jones-UBS
            Commodity Index 3 Month Forward Total Return minus a fee with
            all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the
            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank originally
            sold $65 million of the notes on Nov. 18, 2010, and an
            additional $90 million on Feb. 28 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones-UBS benchmark, which tracks natural gas and
            19 other commodities, declined 9.4 percent this year to 546.7 at
            the close of trading yesterday. The index would have to rise
            more than 8 percent from the day the securities were most
            recently issued in order to reach the initial level from
            November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'America's power needs are only increasing with
            population, as well as the general trend of people moving from
            colder states to the Sun Belt,' said Aaron Calder, senior
            market analyst at Gelber Associates in Houston. U.S.
            regulations could decrease coal production, boosting prices for
            other energy sources, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have bought $760.5 million of commodity-tied
            notes this year, the slowest period since Bloomberg started
            collecting data on the securities in 2010. Globally, banks have
            sold about $2 billion of the securities this year, the least
            since 2004, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
            declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on the
            securities in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects second paragraph to show that Ambito reported
            that holdout creditors were in talks with banks.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. met with
            holders of Argentina's defaulted bonds yesterday to discuss
            buying the securities in a transaction that would allow the
            South American country to resume paying interest on restructured
            notes, according to a bank official familiar with the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The talks, which also involve other banks potentially
            interested in a deal, are ongoing, according to the person, who
            asked not to be identified because the information is private.
            Buenos Aires-based newspaper Ambito reported today that banks
            including JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. were in discussions to buy
            the notes from Elliott Management Corp. and other holders that
            won a court order for full repayment on the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation missed a deadline yesterday to pay $539 million
            in interest, falling into default after two days of negotiations
            in New York failed to produce an accord with Elliott, Aurelius
            Capital Management LP and other creditors from its last default
            in 2001. Aurelius said in a statement that while it has been
            approached by private parties seeking a deal, no agreement has
            been reached. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Aurelius has received no such proposal that we considered
            worthy of serious consideration,' the firm said. 'Much of what
            we have read in the press about such approaches has been, as far
            as we are aware, inaccurate or unreliable.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fired JPMorgan Banker Wins Delay Damages From Own Lawyers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A fired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) banker
            won 66,163 pounds ($111,700) of damages from law firm Mishcon de
            Reya after his lawyers there failed to file a legal document on
            time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judge Ingrid Simler found that Russell Chweidan lost an
            opportunity to challenge a decision in his employment claim at
            the U.K. Employment Appeal Tribunal in 2009 because lawyers at
            Mishcon missed a filing deadline. Simler based the award on
            Chweidan having an 18 percent chance of success in the dispute
            with the bank and a probable claim value of 357,575 pounds, plus
            interest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The breach of duty was the effective cause of these lost
            opportunities,' Simler said in her ruling at the U.K. High
            Court today. 'There was sufficient time to enable the cross-appeal to be lodged with the EAT before the
            deadline.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chweidan, 50, who was fired as an executive director by
            JPMorgan in 2008, brought a claim against the New York-based
            lender, in which Mishcon represented him. He initially prevailed
            on grounds of disability discrimination and unfair dismissal,
            and was awarded about 600,000 pounds. JPMorgan appealed.
            Chweidan's lawyers at Mishcon missed the deadline for his cross
            appeal, the discrimination finding against the bank was
            overturned on appeal and Chweidan was awarded 68,000 pounds for
            unfair dismissal, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The only claim the judge found in favour of the claimant
            was the one that Mishcon de Reya had candidly accepted' at an
            early stage, the law firm said in an e-mailed statement. 'All
            of Russell Chweidan's other claims were rejected and,
            consequently, he has only received a fraction of the
            compensation that he sued for.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chweidan, who is now head of G3 credit trading at Bank of
            China International Ltd. in London, said he couldn't immediately
            comment on the judge's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Russell Chweidan v Mishcon de Reya Solicitors,
            case no. 13-1462, U.K. High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench
            Division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Morgan Stanley in Losing JBS Business</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The bidding war for Hillshire Brands
            Co. (HSH) is proving costly for the Brazilian bankers at JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After firing Morgan Stanley from a bond sale, Sao Paulo-based JBS SA (JBSS3) pulled JPMorgan from a
            stock offering because the
            two banks are helping Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) counter its bid for
            Hillshire, two people familiar with the situation said, asking
            not to be identified as the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two investment banks are advising Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson in a $6.2 billion offer for
            the maker of Jimmy Dean
            sausages that trumped a $5.6 billion proposal from JBS, the
            world's largest meat producer. The Brazilian company's firing of
            JPMorgan follows at least a dozen bond sales that the bank
            helped manage for JBS since 2006 and a $6.3 billion takeover of
            Bertin SA in 2009 where it acted as one of JBS's advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tyson, the world's No.2 meat producer, announced its bid
            and said it hired the two New York-based banks two days after
            JBS's May 27 offer, saying JPMorgan is also likely to join
            Morgan Stanley (MS) in providing bridge financing for the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jeremiah O'Callaghan, investor relations director for JBS,
            declined to comment, as did Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman
            for Morgan Stanley, andVeronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman
            for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is the No. 2 global deals adviser this year,
            handling $394 billion of announced mergers and acquisitions and
            trailing only Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is fifth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranks second among underwriters of Latin American
            dollar- and euro-denominated bonds in 2014, while Morgan Stanley
            is 10th, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;First IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JBS is seeking regulatory approval to sell shares of its
            JBS Foods SA unit in what would be Brazil's first initial public
            offering this year. Voting shares of the unit holding JBS's
            Brazilian pork, poultry and food-processing operations will be
            listed in Brazil's Novo Mercado subject to regulatory approval
            and market conditions, it said in a May 20 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit was formed after JBS agreed to buy Seara food-processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods
            SA for 5.85 billion
            reais ($2.6 billion) in June 2013. JBS hired units of JPMorgan
            and Banco Bradesco for a 3 billion-real IPO of the unit, two
            people with direct knowledge of the matter said in April. JBS
            also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander SA, Grupo BTG
            Pactual and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the share offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. was helping manage JBS's planned $750
            million bond sale, which the meatpacker has temporarily
            withdrawn as it seeks a new leading coordinator, according to a
            May 29 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reviewing Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of JBS rose 0.8 percent today to 7.56 reais as of
            11:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JBS has spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past
            decade to overtake Tyson in the meat industry. JBS's Pilgrim's
            Pride Corp. unit offered $45 a share for Hillshire, compared
            with Tyson's $50 offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following Tyson's May 29 bid, Pilgrim's is reviewing its
            options, according to a person familiar with the matter. It's
            too early to say whether the company will raise its offer, said
            the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            deliberations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The acquisition of Hillshire, potentially JBS's largest
            takeover since the acquisition of Bertin in 2009, would boost
            the company's debt levels to at least the highest in four years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fed Unwinding of QE Has Limited Hong Kong Impact, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A gradual increase in U.S. interest
            rates will have limited impact on Hong Kong equities because
            benefits from a stronger economy will outweigh the negatives,
            according to JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve may slow its asset purchases in the
            second half of this year if the U.S. labor market continues to
            improve, and may start raising interest rates from mid- to late
            2014, said Tai Hui, Hong Kong-based chief market strategist for
            Asia at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees about $1.5
            trillion globally. A liquidity withdrawal caused by U.S.
            interest-rate hikes will have little impact on the city's equity
            market because most of the fund flows associated with
            quantitative easing have been into fixed income, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As long as it's not a shock to the upside in interest
            rates, Hong Kong should be able to withstand it,' Hui said in
            an interview on May 29. 'We still like equities despite
            acknowledging the event of the Fed cutting back on quantitative
            easing and raising interest rates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index surged 21 percent from September
            through January as the Federal Reserve undertook a third round
            of quantitative easing. Cash inflows forced the Hong Kong
            Monetary Authority to intervene in foreign-exchange markets for
            the first time in three years in order to protect the Hong Kong
            dollar's peg to the U.S. currency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve members are debating when to reduce
            stimulus that includes holding benchmark interest rates in a
            range of zero to 0.25 percent and $85 billion a month of bond
            purchases. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last week that the
            central bank could begin winding that back if the economy shows
            sustained improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Worst Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even with increasing evidence of a recovery in the world's
            largest economy, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index is down
            1.7 percent this year, the worst among developed markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slowing growth in China and government efforts to damp
            property prices in Hong Kong and the mainland have weighed on
            equities. Brokerages and the International Monetary Fund lowered
            their forecasts for world's second-biggest economy last month.
            Government data on June 1 showed the nation's manufacturing
            expanded last month, while a private survey yesterday from HSBC
            Holdings Plc and Markit Economics signaled a contraction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When Chinese growth is not matching expectations, it will
            be a struggle for Hong Kong to perform well,' Hui said. 'Over
            the long run, we still think China is cheap. There's a lot of
            potential, but you need earnings to really set the house on fire
            and that's just not happening.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Buying Opportunities &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, there's buying opportunities in Chinese companies
            listed in Hong Kong and in the mainland, Hui said, without
            naming any companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financial companies have room for organic growth, he said.
            Valuations are attractive after shares priced in potential
            credit quality concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A gauge of banks, developers and insurers in the MSCI China
            Index is down 3.7 percent this year and is trading at 6.9 times
            estimated earnings. That compares with a global financials
            measure, which trades for 12 times estimated earnings after
            gaining 8.7 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer companies may have steady growth and investors are
            willing to pay a premium, Hui said. Exporters and materials
            companies should be avoided because of the slow European economy
            and a sluggish recovery in the U.S., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asian equities will offer returns through the second-half
            of this year and into 2014, according to Hui. The upside for
            equities relative to bonds is much more attractive because
            capital gains for fixed income will be limited, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been advocating to clients they should really
            start to tip-toe back into equities,' Hui said, noting that the
            company may increase its equity allocation further. 'When
            earnings start to cooperate, we will advocate an even more
            aggressive stance on equities.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former JPMorgan Trader Gulati Said to Get $300 Million for Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deepak Gulati, a former head of
            global equity proprietary trading at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM),
            started investing at his own hedge fund after raising about $300
            million, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentiere Capital AG, run by Gulati, 35, and a team of
            former colleagues from JPMorgan, started trading yesterday from
            its base in Zug, Switzerland, said the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the move hasn't been made public. The fund
            will focus on volatility trades, betting on the rate at which
            stocks rise or fall. Gulati declined to comment on the
            fundraising or his backers yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He joins a growing group of traders who've left banks since
            the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 prompted
            U.S. regulators to try to limit risk-taking by lenders, through
            the so-called Volcker rule, a law that tries to prevent lenders
            from using federally-insured deposits to make speculative bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Nomura Holdings
            Inc. executives who left to start hedge funds in the past three
            years have already shut their firms down after they lost money
            amid markets dominated by Europe's sovereign debt crisis.
            Pierre-Henri Flamand, former head of Goldman Sachs's biggest
            proprietary-trading unit, and Herve Gallo, a former equity-derivatives trader at Nomura, have both shut
            their funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentiere, named after a skiing village in the French
            Alps, has 15 employees, including seven former JPMorgan workers
            focused on trading and investment analysis, the people said. The
            firm plans to stop seeking additional investors if assets climb
            to $750 million, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm also has portfolio managers who make event-driven
            bets and others who make quantitative wagers. Event-driven
            investors try to profit from corporate actions such as
            acquisitions, bankruptcies and buybacks, while quant investors
            use mathematical models to predict changes in asset prices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asset Management Boosts Treasury Holdings on Fed Bet</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management boosted its
            Treasury holdings in recent weeks to take advantage of higher
            yields and on the expectation the Federal Reserve will maintain
            an accommodative monetary policy to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year yield climbed to the highest level in
            14 months last week amid speculation improving U.S. economic
            data will prompt the Fed to scale down its asset-purchase
            program. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last month the Fed could
            reduce stimulus if there are indications of economic growth will
            be sustained. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You've got an ambiguous growth picture,' said Nick Gartside, international chief investment
            officer for fixed
            income in London at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees
            about $1.5 trillion. 'That's Treasury supportive because it
            means the risk is that central banks keep monetary policy looser
            as opposed to tightening it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Treasury 10-year yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
            percentage point, to 2.13 percent at 12:07 p.m. in New York
            after climbing to 2.23 percent on May 29, the highest level
            since April 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management increased its holdings of
            Treasuries to 'neutral-ish' from underweight 'a week or so
            ago,' Gartside said. An underweight position means it owns
            fewer securities than recommended in the benchmark index it uses
            to track performance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed, which is buying $85 billion of government and
            mortgage-backed securities each month, will probably taper its
            purchases at some point, Gartside said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'To us it's just part of the natural evolution of central
            bank policy but I think the message is that it will still look
            loose as opposed to tight, irrespective of the degree of
            tapering,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company prefers German and Japanese government bonds to
            Treasuries due to the differences in central-bank policy that
            will probably develop in light of the weaker underlying
            economies of Japan and the euro area, Gartside said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Alabama Debacle Set to Cost Bank $1.6 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) may see as much as $1.6 billion go down an Alabama (BEESAL) sewer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank by assets agreed to forgive $842 million of debt owed to it by Jefferson
            County, Alabama, where it took the lead in arranging risky securities deals that pushed the county into the
            largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, in November 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That agreement follows a $722
            million settlement in 2009 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Jefferson County
            financing. JPMorgan's total costs amount to a quarter of the $6.2 billion trading loss in 2012 from
            corporate-credit bets by a trader known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth C. Seymour, a
            bank spokeswoman, had no comment on the accord announced yesterday. If accepted by the court, it would cap
            almost a decade-long fiscal disaster in Alabama's largest county, where JPMorgan initially reaped
            substantial fees arranging interest-rate swaps that subsequently proved tainted by municipal corruption and
            devastating to taxpayers during the 2008 credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Everybody thought there was a
            free lunch and they could all take advantage of it at the same time,' said Christopher Taylor, the former
            executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. 'It burned them all.' &lt;/p&gt;

            from the county. Close

            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s investment bank in the United Arab
            Emirates, is leaving the U.S. lender, according to two people
            with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yared left the bank for personal reasons, said the people,
            who asked not to be identified as the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment. Yared

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has been boosting its presence in the region by
            hiring executives from banks including Nomura International Plc

        <headline>JPMorgan Unit's MModal Wins Approval of Bankruptcy Terms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MModal Inc., the medical-transcription company indirectly controlled by JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM), won court approval of the rough terms of a plan to
            reorganize and will seek final approval July 15 to exit
            bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Grossman yesterday approved
            MModal's disclosure statement, which explains how much creditors
            will get. The reorganized company is projected to earn $57
            million before taxes and other items this year and $71 million a
            year by 2017, enough to support its new debt load of about $320
            million in secured debt, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The disclosure statement complies with the requirements
            of the bankruptcy code' and has enough information to allow
            creditors to vote on the plan, Grossman wrote in an order in
            U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MModal, acquired by New York-based JPMorgan's One Equity
            Partners in a $1.14 billion leveraged buyout in August 2012,
            filed for bankruptcy on March 20. The Franklin, Tennessee-based
            company listed assets of $626.8 million and liabilities totaling
            $876.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MModal struggled to make payments on the debt as software
            and other products supplanted its transcription business, which
            converts health-care providers' dictation to text and generated
            more than 80 percent of revenue. Sales fell more than 9 percent
            last year to $411 million as earnings dropped almost 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's $250 million in 10.75 percent senior
            unsecured notes due in 2020 last traded at 26 cents on the
            dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They sold for
            46.93 cents at the beginning of the year, on Jan. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Legend Parent Inc., 14-bk-10701, U.S.

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Samurai Boom With Biggest Sale Since October</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. lender, raised 105.6 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in the
            largest sale of Samurai bonds since October as overseas
            borrowers flock to a market flush with stimulus cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four-part offering includes 51.5 billion yen of 0.462
            percent three-year bonds priced to yield 10 basis points more
            than the yen swap rate, and 27 billion yen of 2018 notes at a
            spread of 14 basis points, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The New York-based lender also sold 10-year fixed-rate and three-year floating-rate debt, the
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan follows Rabobank Nederland and Nordea Bank AB in
            offering Samurai notes as Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko
            Kuroda's plan to double the monetary base helps bolster demand
            for higher-yielding debt. HSBC Holdings Plc's banking unit,
            Credit Agricole SA and the Slovak Republic are planning
            offerings this month, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors are looking to shift their portfolios from
            government bonds, but they can't really go into the more
            volatile securities like stocks,' Mana Nakazora, Tokyo-based
            chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas SA, said in a telephone
            interview. 'The issuers are taking advantage of the strong
            investor appetite for foreign bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Vouches for Leveraged-Loans as Junk Bonds Face Losses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should turn to leveraged-loans to preserve income as volatility in the high-yield bonds
            sparks outflows, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the second-largest underwriter of the debt in the
            U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Record money flowing into funds that purchase floating-rated debt and issuance of collateralized
            loan obligations has
            supported senior ranking debt in the face of a bond sell-off in
            the last two weeks, the New York-based lender said in a report
            yesterday as it it's overweight loans this month versus bonds.
            Returns of 0.12 percent on the Standard Poor's/LSTA 100 index
            outpaced U.S. junk bonds for the first time in six months, which
            lost 0.5 percent in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by companies in the U.S. suffered losses on
            concern that Federal Reserve policy makers may consider reducing
            stimulus measures that had fueled demand for higher yielding
            debt. Loans funds have received record deposit on expectations
            the debt will deliver positive returns during a period of rising
            rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Loan prices are being supported by demand for floating
            rate instruments amid concerns about QE tapering,' JPMorgan
            strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote in the report. 'This is
            helping to keep the loan market particularly steady in the face
            of higher volatility in high-yield bond markets. A strong
            payroll report on Friday will likely further hurt HY bonds and
            support their floating rate counterparts.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On May 22, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the
            Fed could slow the pace of its $85 billion of bond purchases in
            its 'next few meetings,' in testimony to the Joint Economic
            Committee of Congress in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bonds Lose &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since then, U.S. junk bonds have lost 2.3 percent, to trim
            gains this year to 3 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            index data show. That compares with a 2.6 percent advance for
            the SP/LSTA 100 index this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors added $930 million last week to funds that
            purchase loans, pushing year-to-date deposits to more than $28
            billion, according to a May 30 report from Bank of America Corp.
            That represents an increase of about 36 percent in net assets
            for the year, outperforming funds that purchase credit assets
            such as U.S. and emerging market corporate debt. CLO issuance
            climbed to $35 billion for the year at the end of last month,
            according to SP Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary Data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK)'s iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond
            exchange-traded fund reported investor redemptions of 3.3
            million shares, or about $305 million, from the fund June 4, its
            biggest one-day outflow on record. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans are a form of high-risk debt that carry
            ratings of less than Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and below
            BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Samsung Falls After JPMorgan Cuts Estimates on Galaxy S4</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world's
            largest smartphone maker, fell the most in more than nine months
            in Seoul after analysts at JPMorgan Chase Co. cut profit
            estimates, citing slowing demand for its flagship Galaxy S4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares declined 6.2 percent to 1,427,000 won as of the
            close of trade, the largest drop since Aug. 27. The stock was
            the biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orders for the S4 smartphone, which went on sale last
            month, are slowing on weak demand in Europe that may impact
            profit margins, analysts led by JJ Park said in a report dated
            yesterday, citing supply chain checks. JPMorgan cut its share-price estimate for Samsung by 9.5 percent to
            1.9 million won and
            lowered its 2013 earnings estimates by 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Compared to S3, S4 had stronger momentum in the first
            quarter of launch,' the analysts wrote, affirming their
            overweight rating on the stock. 'But the following quarter's
            shipment is expected to be disappointing and its peak-quarter
            number seems way below our previous estimates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan now expects Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung's
            shipments of the S4 to be 60 million this year, compared with a
            previous estimate of 80 million. Samsung sold 10 million units
            of the S4 within 27 days, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It also unveiled a smaller, less-powerful version of the
            phone last week. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;ING U.S. Inc. (VOYA), the insurer that had
            its initial public offering last month, declined 3 percent in
            New York trading after JPMorgan Chase Co. gave the stock a
            neutral recommendation, citing risks related to annuities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, majority-owned by ING Groep NV (INGA), fell to $27.57
            at 1 p.m. after dipping as low as $27.25. Analysts at JPMorgan
            led by Jimmy Bhullar set a 2014 year-end price target of $28 for
            the New York-based insurer. The IPO price was $19.50 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ING U.S. is coping with liabilities from variable
            annuities, in which the company ensures minimum returns to
            clients on portfolios of stocks and bonds. ING U.S. has scaled
            back from selling the retirement products. JPMorgan analysts
            said in a research note that they expect return on equity to
            'remain sub-par.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These factors, along with the prospect of secondary
            offerings, justify the stock's discount valuation,' the
            analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ING Groep is required to sell off its stake in the U.S.
            business by the end of 2016. ING U.S., which is changing its
            name to Voya Financial, was the fourth-largest seller of
            variable annuities in 2007 and had dropped out of the top 20 by
            2011, according to data from industry group Limra. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
            Deutsche Bank AG also rated the shares the equivalent of neutral
            in research notes today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The ratings are in line with our expectations and confirm
            what we've been saying all along,' Dana Ripley, an ING U.S.
            spokesman, said in a phone interview. 'We need to focus on the
            execution of our retirement-readiness strategy and our ROE-improvement program, which were two of the key
            elements of our
            investment narrative.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Says There Was No Lying, Hiding on Whale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co (JPM). will fight 'till the end' anyone who sues claiming they were misled over
            more than $6.2 billion in losses at the chief investment office last year, Chief Executive Officer Jamie
            Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There was no hiding, there was no lying, there was no bulls----ing,
            period,' Dimon said today at a conference sponsored by Morgan Stanley in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            he conceded the company made some mistakes, 'no one at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), not one single solitary person,
            from CIO, to risk, to finance, to myself -- and a lot of people looked at it -- thought we had a big
            problem' when the bank reported earnings on April 13, 2012, the day Dimon dismissed news reports about the
            trade as a 'complete tempest in a teapot,' he said. Executives thought they had losses that might cost about
            $200 million, Dimon said, 'not a $6 billion problem.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trading book had already lost
            more than $1 billion by that time, according to documents turned over to the U.S. Senate Permanent
            Subcommittee on Investigations, which released a 301-page report in March that accused the largest and most
            profitable U.S. bank of hiding losses, deceiving regulators and misinforming investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon,
            57, said the New York-based company would vigorously defend against lawsuits tied to the losses. 'Anyone who
            sues, we're going to fight that one till the end, too, by the way,' he said. 'So keep that in mind.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Credit Outlook Cut by S&amp;amp;P as U.S. Support Wanes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s credit-rating
            outlook was revised to negative by Standard Poor's, which said
            the likelihood of 'extraordinary' government support for the
            largest U.S. banks is waning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The outlook on JPMorgan's long-term rating of A was lowered
            from stable, SP said today in a statement. That brings JPMorgan
            in line with the seven other 'systemically important' banks
            including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
            whose outlooks were held at negative. New York-based JPMorgan is
            the biggest U.S. bank, with $2.4 trillion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP may stop giving weight to the implied taxpayer support
            that has bolstered credit ratings at eight of the largest U.S.
            bank-holding companies. In the wake of the 2008 credit crunch,
            investors have assumed the federal government would bail out
            lenders in a renewed crisis because their failure would be
            catastrophic for the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is becoming increasingly clear that holding company
            creditors may not receive extraordinary government support,'
            SP analysts led by Matthew Albrecht wrote in the statement. He
            cited the framework regulators are developing that could be used
            to dismantle and liquidate distressed banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP analysts believe that the U.S. government would still
            stand by the operating subsidiaries of the largest banks,
            Albrecht said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Absorbing Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Regulators are intent on asking holding-company creditors
            to absorb losses ahead of operating-company creditors, and
            they're putting mechanisms in place that could make that more
            likely,' he said. 'We don't believe the U.S. government is
            becoming less supportive, simply less supportive to a certain
            class of creditors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If SP entirely removed U.S. support from the credit rating
            of the bank-holding companies, it could result in a one- to two-level cut in their grades, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares dropped 0.9 percent to $53.90 at 11:52
            a.m. in New York, compared with a 0.7 percent decline in the KBW
            Bank Index. Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the bank, didn't
            respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP said it will review progress that regulators make on
            their new 'orderly liquidation authority' as it determines
            whether to stop including government support in its bank
            ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lehman Bankruptcy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. and U.K. regulators have been working on plans to
            allow large international banks to fail without damaging the
            rest of the financial system. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc. in 2008 helped trigger a worldwide economic
            meltdown that threatened to destroy other global lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We may remove the ratings uplift we currently incorporate
            if we believe that regulators and lawmakers are increasingly
            likely to ask holding-company bondholders to bear losses in the
            event of a liquidation of a systemically important bank,' SP
            said. 'We currently believe those creditors will be supported
            to prevent the contagion of a crisis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both the Bank of England and the Federal Deposit Insurance
            Corp. foresee that a wide range of unsecured creditors could
            face losses during a bank's failure, according to a paper
            released in December. Unsecured senior bondholders and uninsured
            depositors are among those who could take a financial hit, the
            paper said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan CFO Says Investment Bank May Need Job Cuts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank, may have to cut jobs and reduce
            compensation if trading revenue fails to rebound as expected,
            Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With results holding at current levels, 'compensation will
            come down,' Lake said today at an investor conference in New
            York. 'Then in the longer term, the question is whether we will
            have too much capacity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan warned investors last month that second-quarter
            fixed-income and equities trading would probably drop about 20
            percent from a year earlier amid low volatility across asset
            classes. Lake, 45, affirmed the New York-based bank's forecast
            today and said the slowdown appeared to be cyclical, rather than
            a permanent shift. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over time, we should expect to see these cyclical
            headwinds abate and get replaced with tailwinds,' including
            stronger global economic growth and higher interest rates, Lake
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's size allows it to withstand market lulls without
            overreacting, she said, while acknowledging the possibility that
            job cuts could be needed over the longer term. Rivals including
            Morgan Stanley have reduced staff and Zurich-based Credit Suisse
            Group AG is weighing the sale of additional stakes in an
            electronic interest-rates trading unit. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Great Moderation 2.0 Seen Lasting by JPMorgan Until Fed Shifts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The calm that has descended on
            financial markets has longer to run if history is any guide. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Having coined the phrase Great Moderation 2.0 to describe
            the lull back in April, JPMorgan Chase Co.'s John Normand is
            comparing this moment to periods of tranquility over the past
            three decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His findings suggest the quiescence is here to stay for a
            while, meaning investors may be lulled into taking ever-greater
            risks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's head of foreign-exchange and international-rates
            strategy in London characterizes low volatility in the currency
            market as when swings in the Group of 10 major currencies slip
            and stay below 7 percent on a trailing three-month basis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While that happened for 45 business days as of the end of
            last week, the average timeframe of similar episodes since the
            1980s is 150 days. They ranged in length from three months when
            the Federal Reserve paused its easing of monetary policy in 2002
            to almost two years during the so-called Goldilocks era of the
            late 1990s when the U.S. economy was neither too hot nor too
            cold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The current undershoot is quiet immature by the
            historical norm,' Normand wrote in a June 6 research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More often than not, the Fed is the key. The last market
            lull ran for 156 business days and ended in May 2013 with the
            'taper tantrum' when Fed officials began suggesting they would
            soon start slowing monthly asset purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As most would acknowledge, central bank predictability is
            bearish for volatility,' he said. 'The current backdrop is
            textbook.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This time, the calm may continue unless U.S. inflation data
            or wage pressures force the Fed into tightening policy sooner
            than markets anticipate or if a geopolitical crisis blows up,
            said Normand. A Bloomberg News survey of economists in May
            suggested the consensus doesn't expect the Fed to raise its
            benchmark before the third quarter of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until these risks emerge 'this vol undershoot has further
            to run,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. named Manuel Esteve head of equity syndicate for Europe, the Middle East and
            Africa, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esteve succeeds Greg Chamberlain, who will become head of
            the U.K. equity capital markets team, according to the memo,
            which was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the New York-based
            bank. Jonathan Wilcox, who has run U.K. equity capital markets,
            will move to U.K. investment banking to focus on corporate
            clients as a coverage banker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esteve previously ran the Iberia and Greece ECM team.
            Francesco Cardinali will add Iberia and Greece to his current
            responsibilities as head of Italy and Turkey equity capital
            markets, the memo shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ranked No. 6 in managing share sales in Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa this year, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. The U.S. bank was the sole manager of Volkswagen

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street's biggest bond dealers
            are telling clients to shift from most fixed-income markets into
            U.S. stocks as deepening concern the Federal Reserve will pare
            unprecedented stimulus fuels the worst debt losses since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the most-active underwriter of
            corporate bonds since 2007, last week joined Barclays Plc (BARC), Bank
            of America Corp. (BAC), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. in
            recommending stocks over most bonds as equity returns outpace
            company notes by the most since at least 1997. The Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate High Yield Index's 0.73
            percent loss this year through June 11 compares with a 15.1
            percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. (SPX) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Securities from Treasuries to junk bonds are showing their
            vulnerability to a potential pullback from Fed actions that have
            pumped more than $2.5 trillion into the financial system since
            2008. Debt 'remains most tied up with the search for yield'
            and faces more volatility than equities as interest rates rise,
            JPMorgan strategists led by Jan Loeys said in a June 7 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've now seen a little bit of a rotation out of bond
            funds,' said Hans Mikkelsen, head of U.S. investment-grade
            credit strategy at Bank of America in New York. 'You could see
            a very quick change in asset allocation on the retail side that
            the institutional side can't keep up with it.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            The global economy is 'in the early stages of the recovery of the equity culture and perhaps the end of a
            30-year growing love affair' with bonds, said Jim O'Neill, former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management
            in a June 11 interview on Bloomberg Television. Close

            Officer John Hogan is returning to the bank in a new role after
            taking almost five months off and may decide to leave the firm
            altogether later this year or next, Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon told employees in a memo today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hogan will return to Dimon's operating committee and assume
            a newly created job as chairman of risk while interim CRO Ashley Bacon takes over in a permanent capacity
            starting next week,
            Dimon said in the memo. Bacon will also join the operating
            committee, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'John plans to carry out this important transition for
            several months,' Dimon said. 'We then hope he will stay at the
            firm in another senior role, but he may choose to do something
            different outside of our company.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A copy of the memo was obtained by Bloomberg News, and its
            contents were confirmed by Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the
            New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon said Hogan 'did a superb job as head of risk when we
            needed him most' and that he respects Hogan's decision to
            return to the bank in a different role. Hogan took leave in
            January for personal reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're very glad to have John back -- his judgment and
            candor make all of us better,' Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The business eventually will be split off as those
            investments mature, according to a person with direct knowledge
            of the plan. One Equity manages about $4.5 billion for the bank,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The One Equity team has produced strong returns over the
            years,' Matt Zames, JPMorgan's chief operating officer, said in
            the statement. 'The time is right for them to seek new capital
            to strengthen their global strategy, as they continue to manage
            our existing portfolio to maximize value to the firm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are expanding businesses overseeing client money as
            they seek more stable forms of revenue, such as management fees.
            JPMorgan's private-equity results have been uneven in recent
            quarters, swinging from a $50 million profit in the fourth
            quarter to a $182 million loss in the first three months of this
            year, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Volatile Earnings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earnings within the unit will likely be volatile and
            'influenced by capital-markets activity, market levels, the
            performance of the broader economy and investment-specific
            issues,' the company said in a May 8 filing with the Securities
            and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One Equity typically invests from $50 million to $250
            million per transaction, the firm said, concentrating in North
            America, Europe, Asia and South America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federally backed banks face restrictions in how much they
            can invest in private-equity and hedge funds under the so-called
            Volcker rule, a provision of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The rule
            limits investments to no more than 3 percent of the fund or 3
            percent of the lender's Tier 1 capital. JPMorgan had about $7.7
            billion in total private-equity holdings and $163.8 billion in
            Tier 1 capital as of March 31, according to regulatory filings. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ditch Credit for Stocks Says JPMorgan Seeing End of Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate-bond buyers are
            increasingly becoming stock pickers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-yield debt funds boosted their allocations to equities
            to 3.2 percent in March from 3.1 percent in December and 2.1
            percent at the end of 2012, Morgan Stanley (MS) data show. JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) strategists suggested others do the same, last week
            advising investors to cut their credit holdings as yields
            dwindle and switch to equities instead. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the outlook for American businesses still looks
            pretty good to investors, they're growing uneasy about owning
            bonds that offer some of the lowest yields in history. That
            angst is only made worse by the reduced liquidity that's
            resulted from banks pulling back in debt trading, raising
            concern that the market will spiral downward when everyone tries
            to sell at once. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see credit as relatively over-owned and valued versus
            other risk assets,' JPMorgan strategists led by Jan Loeys wrote
            in a June 13 report. 'Investors are beginning to worry about
            how the eventual exit will fare in a world of reduced market
            making by banks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equities look more attractive because they haven't
            benefited as much as company debt from the easy-money policies
            of central banks across the globe, according to the analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trading Drops &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds may also be hurt more in a sell-off because
            the biggest dealers are reducing their fixed-income inventories
            in response to risk-curbing regulations, causing trading volumes
            to drop. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the size of the investment-grade company-bond market
            ballooned 82 percent since the end of 2008, trading volumes only
            increased 72 percent in the period, according to Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data.
            Since the end of April, an average $13 billion of the debt has
            been exchanged each day, compared with $13.8 billion in the
            period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That hasn't mattered much -- at least not yet -- because
            central banks have been pumping more and more stimulus into the
            global economy, pushing investors into riskier assets. That's
            made for a one-way market in bonds, with few wanting to sell
            investment-grade notes that have rallied 61 percent since 2008,
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So, what happens when sentiment reverses? JPMorgan analysts
            suggest investors may want to cut their credit positions before
            finding out. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Buying Stocks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Junk-bond buyers earned 3.46 percentage points more than
            benchmark rates to own U.S. speculative-grade securities as of
            June 10, the lowest since 2007 and 2.41 percentage points lower
            than the two-decade average. That means fewer potential gains
            and a smaller cushion against a bear market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are indeed at that point of the cycle where one should
            not expect that much more spread tightening,' the JPMorgan
            strategists wrote. 'We prefer to take more risk in equities and
            we now cut the size of our U.S. high-yield spread trade by one-third.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Managers of junk-bond mutual funds seem to agree. They
            increased the proportion of assets that fall outside of
            benchmark indexes to 15 percent of holdings as of March from
            14.6 percent in December, according to a June 6 report by Morgan
            Stanley. They boosted allocations to stocks, securitized debt
            and loans, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While almost all U.S. markets may look expensive right now,
            equities may be a better bet than bonds when central banks
            start yanking their stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named Ina De
            and Conor Hillery co-heads of its U.K. investment banking
            business, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;De, currently co-head of equity capital markets for Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa, and Hillery, head of the U.K.
            financial institutions group, will report to Chairman Tim Wise,
            the memo shows. Its contents were confirmed by a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            have been increasing their share of European investment-banking
            fees, the New York-based research firm Freeman Co. reported
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's broking clients include the U.K.'s largest
            fixed-line telecommunications company, BT Group Plc (BT/A), as well as

        <headline>BofA Appoints JPMorgan's Zakkour Co-Head of Global TMT Banking</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. hired Anwar Zakkour from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) as co-head of global
            telecommunications, media and technology investment banking,
            according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zakkour will remain based in New York, reporting to global
            head of investment banking Christian Meissner, according to the
            memo, whose contents were confirmed by a Bank of America
            spokesman. His co-head will be Chet Bozdog, currently head of
            global technology investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zakkour, recently vice chairman of investment banking,
            follows top bankers such as Jim Woolery in leaving JPMorgan this
            year. Bank of America trails JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. in advising on MA globally this year, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman at JPMorgan declined to comment. The firm and
            Bank of America are the largest U.S. banks by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zakkour joined JPMorgan in 2005 and later advanced to
            global head of telecommunications, media and technology MA
            before becoming vice chairman in 2011. He recently advised
            MetroPCS Communications Inc. on its merger with Deutsche Telekom
            AG's T-Mobile USA, after earlier working on ATT Inc.'s failed
            $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zakkour was part of the team that advised General Electric
            Co. on its two-stage sale of NBC Universal to Comcast Corp.
            Comcast first bought a 51 percent stake in the media company in
            2011 and this year purchased the rest. His other significant
            deals include the restructuring and the merger that created
            Sirius XM Radio Inc. and News Corp.'s acquisition of Dow Jones
            Co. in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Lancashire Holdings Falls on JPMorgan Downgrade: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lancashire Holdings Ltd. (LRE) fell the
            most in three months after JPMorgan Chase Co. cut its rating
            on the Lloyds of London insurer for the first time in at least
            three years, citing softening premium rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares dropped as much as 5.9 percent, the biggest
            intraday decline since March 20, and were down 2.6 percent at
            762 pence at 12:40 p.m. in London. The volume of shares traded
            was almost twice the three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A softening rate outlook across Lancashire's portfolio
            will cap underwriting progress,' Andreas van Embden, an analyst
            at JPMorgan, said in a note. 'We see a lack of immediate
            catalysts for the shares ahead of the hurricane season.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Property catastrophe reinsurance rates for June have fallen
            about 15 percent, reflecting the lack of hurricanes in Florida
            and increased competition, Nick Johnson, a London-based analyst
            at Numis Securities Ltd., wrote in a note dated June 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Catastrophe insurance premiums have eased in the U.S. as no
            hurricane has made landfall in Florida, the fourth-most populous
            state, since 2005. This year, there is a 16 percent chance a
            Category 3 hurricane, with winds of at least 111 miles per hour
            (179 kph), will hit Florida, Colorado State University
            researchers forecast in April. That's down from 21 percent in an
            average year. The six-month hurricane season began on June 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;UBS List &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Van Embden cut his rating on the stock to neutral from
            overweight and lowered his 12-month price target by 7 percent to
            800 pence. Van Embden has had an overweight rating on Lancashire
            since he started covering the insurer for JPMorgan in 2010,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lancashire remains an attractive income stock with a
            special dividend of 65 pence a share, offering a yield of 9
            percent, likely to be announced in the second half, van Embden
            said. The stock is fully valued compared with its returns, the
            analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's downgrade comes five days after UBS AG initiated
            coverage with a buy recommendation and added Lancashire to its
            key calls list of small and medium-capitalization companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lancashire had achieved the highest returns in the
            industry, coupled with the lowest volatility, between 2008 and
            2012, UBS analyst Angela Gu, who set a 12-month price target of
            850 pence, said in a note to clients. Its prospective total
            dividend yield of 10 percent for the next three years was the
            highest in the industry, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Numis's Johnson and EVA Dimensions also both upgraded the
            stock this month. The drop in the share price had left
            Lancashire's valuation in line with its competitors, Johnson
            wrote, upgrading his rating to add from hold. The shares fell 21
            percent between March 4 and June 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lancashire's 'nimble strategy and relatively small capital
            base will enable it to sustain superior operating performance
            versus peers,' Johnson wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Buy Property in Downtown San Francisco</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset-management unit bought a San Francisco property from Jamestown
            LP in a $415 million deal that includes offices, a hotel and a
            development site, said two people with knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase of 22 Fourth St. near Union Square closed
            today, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
            transaction is private. JPMorgan will acquire 430,000 square
            feet (40,000 square meters) in two buildings known as Pacific
            Place, as well as a land parcel, the people said. Tenants
            include the 198-room Hotel Palomar, software maker Intuit Inc.
            and retailers Old Navy, Levi's and the Container Store. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, declined to comment. Jamestown, a closely held real
            estate investment firm based in Atlanta, confirmed the sale
            without naming the buyer or price in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;San Francisco's office market is luring property investors
            after a surge in leasing demand led by technology companies
            pushed rents up 70 percent since 2010, according to Jones Lang
            LaSalle Inc. The metropolitan area has California's lowest
            unemployment rate at 4.3 percent and an economy that has added
            jobs each month for almost five years, state labor data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very strong market, with tons of tenant activity
            driving investment activity,' Grant Lammersen, a sales broker
            at Cushman Wakefield Inc. with a waterfront office listing at
            188 Embarcadero, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Salesforce Tower &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com Inc. in April agreed to lease 714,000 square
            feet in a skyscraper being built by Boston Properties Inc. that
            will be the city's tallest and named for San Francisco-based
            Salesforce, the biggest maker of customer-management software. A
            unit of Shenzhen, China-based developer Genzon Property Group
            Co. last month bought a majority stake in 225 Bush St. offices
            in the financial district, in a deal valued at $350 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pacific Place, two blocks from Union Square's cluster of
            upscale shops and theaters, has 202,000 square feet of offices
            fully leased to Mountain View, California-based Intuit's
            Demandforce unit and 200 feet (61 meters) of retail frontage on
            Market Street, Jamestown said. The area is the main transit
            corridor for city buses and Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, the
            regional subway and rail system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The addition of a signature tenant like Intuit and its
            long-term lease created an attractive investment for a buyer,'
            Jamestown Chief Operating Officer Michael Phillips said in the
            statement. 'We remain committed to the San Francisco Bay Area
            as we are very engaged in the community through our other local
            properties.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan buys properties on behalf of institutional
            investors through its Global Real Assets business. The unit, run
            by Joe Azelby, invests and manages in real estate,
            infrastructure and maritime assets around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC was the listing broker for Jamestown. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Russian stocks have been so volatile

            that he's willing to work with Ukraine's new leader, reducing
            concern that Russia will face more sanctions. Bank of America
            Corp., which has had a buy rating on Russian stocks since
            September, reiterated its bullish view on June 17. Deutsche Bank
            AG strategist John-Paul Smith predicted a rebound six weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The two key catalysts are the fading of the Ukraine
            crisis and the shift in positioning,' JPMorgan analysts
            including David Aserkoff and Christian Kern wrote in a report on
            June 18. 'Global emerging-market funds are underweight for the
            first time since 2009. The emerging-market value trade seems to
            be working, which should benefit Russia.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The analysts raised their rating on Russian shares to
            overweight after cutting it to underweight on March 6 as Putin
            began the annexation of Crimea. The Micex entered a bull market
            on June 6. The gauge's 30-day historical volatility, a measure
            of price swings, reached a five-year high of 46.2 percent on
            April 11. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ukraine Conflict &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko yesterday reiterated a
            plan to end fighting in the country's southeast region after
            talks with Putin. The Micex gained for the second day, rising
            0.7 percent to 1,504.23 by 8:20 a.m. in New York. The Bloomberg
            Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in
            the U.S. jumped 1.9 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Russia still provides better value than other emerging
            markets,' David Hauner, a strategist at Bank of America, said
            in a telephone interview from London yesterday. 'The risk
            reward is not as high as it was a couple of months ago, but our
            view on global equities is positive and Russia will outperform
            the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith, the Deutsche Bank strategist who predicted Russia's
            1998 stock-market crash and had been bearish on the country for
            more than three years, said in May that investors were
            overreacting to the conflict in Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's second-biggest oil producer OAO Lukoil (LUKOY), eastern
            Europe's biggest lender OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) and Russia's second-biggest
            mobile phone company OAO Megafon (MFON) are among JPMorgan's top
            emerging-market stock picks, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aserkoff in London and Kantarovich in Moscow weren't
            available for comment on the timing of their overweight
            recommendation when contacted by phone and e-mail outside
            regular business hours yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Pretty Negative' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised Russian stocks to overweight on May 8
            before Ukraine elected Poroshenko. Citigroup Inc. has an
            overweight recommendation on Russia in its global emerging
            markets portfolio, according to a report this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capital Economics Ltd., in an e-mailed research note
            yesterday, said it is 'relatively downbeat on the outlook for
            Russian equities' and expects stocks and the ruble to fall. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our view on the Russian market is pretty negative,' Liza Ermolenko, a London-based emerging-market
            economist at Capital
            Economics, said by phone yesterday. 'While the economy is
            slowing, no one really knows what is next in the Ukraine crisis
            and whether further sanctions against Russia will be approved.
            The Russian market is very sensitive to the Ukraine crises, and
            there is no quick solution.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;International Sanctions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine will call a unilateral cease-fire to help end three
            months of fighting with pro-Russian separatists, Poroshenko said
            in Kiev yesterday. Insurgents will be given a limited window to
            lay down their arms, with those who haven't committed any
            serious crimes to be offered an amnesty and safe passage out of
            the country, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and European Union have imposed sanctions
            including travel bans and asset freezes on Putin allies in
            Russia and Ukraine to punish the country for its standoff with
            Ukraine. Russia's gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent in the
            first quarter from the same period in 2013, the slowest pace in
            a year, the Federal State Statistics Service said on May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the $2 trillion economy was stalling before the
            sanctions, the U.S. and EU have warned the nation faces further
            penalties if fails to de-escalate the conflict. Ukraine and
            Russia are also in conflict over gas, with Russia cutting off
            supplies on June 16 because of unpaid bills. The International
            Monetary Fund said April 30 that Russia is already in recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex trades at 5.4 times estimated 12-month earnings,
            compared with a ratio of 15.5 for India's SP BSE Sensex Index,
            10.7 for Brazil's Ibovespa and 7.6 for the Shanghai Composite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
            the index futures, was little changed today, while RTS stock-index futures increased 1.6 percent to 132,920
            yesterday. The
            Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S.-traded exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares,
            rose 2.6 percent to
            $26.88. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Boston Race Emotional Return for Bombing Victims</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The last time Roseann Sdoia attended
            a road race, terror shattered the course and left her with a leg
            amputated above the knee. Tonight, she'll be back to sound the
            starting horn as racing returns to downtown Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have mixed emotions because I should be there running,
            but I'm not,' said Sdoia, 45, who has undergone three surgeries
            since the April 15 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three and
            injured more than 260 people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tonight's 3.5-mile J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge race,
            which starts at 7:20 p.m., is one of the first organized
            competitions in downtown Boston since the terrorist attack. It
            begins at the Boston Common and runs parallel to the last mile
            or so of the marathon course. For many participants, the event
            is an emotional return to a neighborhood devastated by the twin
            bomb blasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The race itself symbolizes a lot of the running community
            and the Boston community coming together and really slowly
            taking back the city and taking back running,' said Cara
            Bednar, 28, who finished the marathon in under four hours, about
            10 to 15 minutes before the first blast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 12,000 people from 569 companies are registered for
            tonight's race, said Erich Timmerman, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which is
            organizing the event.
            JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is donating all registration
            fees, about $500,000, to One Fund Boston, which was created to
            assist victims of the bombings and their families, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Plan Sale of $304 Million Mortgage Bonds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is planning a
            sale of U.S. home-loan bonds without government backing, adding
            to evidence that the market for the securities is beginning to
            pick up steam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal will be tied to $303.7 million of prime 15-year
            mortgages, according to a person with knowledge of the
            transaction who asked not to be identified without authorization
            to speak publicly. While most of the loans had original balances
            larger than the current threshold for jumbo mortgages, the
            market's focus since its revival, 14.5 percent of the debt is
            smaller than $400,000, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premium Point Investments LP's WinWater Home Mortgage LLC
            yesterday completed its first non-agency bond transaction, a
            deal tied to about $250 million of jumbo loans, and Citigroup
            Inc. (C) is planning a similar $219 million offering. After reviving
            from the paralysis caused by the 2008 financial crisis the debt
            helped spark, issuance of non-agency securities had slowed after
            the middle of last year as banks seek jumbo loans to hold as
            investments and bond buyers pay less for the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're seeing repeat and new issuers attempt to bring the
            market back,'Michele Patterson, a senior director at Kroll
            Bond Rating Agency, said in a telephone interview. 'We are not
            at last year's levels, and we don't anticipate getting to last
            year's levels. I think the second half will probably be about
            the same as the first half' of the year in terms of sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;September Collapse &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While total issuance of non-agency securities tied to new
            loans jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in
            2012, sales collapsed after September, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance totals about $1.8 billion this
            year. Sales peaked at $1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
            government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
            $625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
            costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average age of the loans in the JPMorgan transaction is
            about one year, with 5.2 percent of the mortgages older than 30
            months, the person said. First Republic Bank originated 55
            percent of the mortgages, while JPMorgan's bank made 38 percent,
            the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Loss Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount of loss protection for investors known as credit
            enhancement, totaling 5.5 percent for part of the AAA portion of
            the transaction, is the lowest yet seen by Kroll, which was
            founded after the crisis and has been hired to grade the deal,
            Patterson said. The inclusion of only mortgages with terms of 15
            years or less, a first since the credit seizure, improves the
            quality of the transaction because the loans typically perform
            better than 30-year debt, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some other AAA portions of the deal have 10 percent
            enhancement, the person said. Most of WinWater's top-rated bonds
            carried 15 percent of credit enhancement, with a smaller amount
            offering a buffer of 8.25 percent. The safety margin is provided
            by features such as some bonds losing principal amid losses on
            the underlying loans before others. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys Larger Developers as Bubble Deflates: China Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management and
            Invesco Asset Management say China's cooling property market is
            an opportunity to boost dollar bond holdings as the government's
            targeted stimulus benefits the largest developers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese real-estate companies accounted for six of the 10
            best-performing Asian notes in the past three months, according
            to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The yield on 2018 debt
            of China Overseas Land Investments Ltd., the nation's largest
            developer by market value, dropped to 3.35 percent last week,
            from a record 4.31 percent on Feb. 5, while that on similar-maturity bonds of China Vanke Co. fell to 3.95
            percent, from an
            all-time high of 5.07 percent on March 20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will pick the winners from these trends,' said
            Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income at JPMorgan Asset,
            which oversees $39 billion in emerging-market debt. 'Although
            sales and prices are falling along with margins, we have
            identified the larger developers are gaining market share and
            executing well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to safeguard this year's
            growth target of 7.5 percent, fueling bets the government will
            encourage increased lending to selected projects and relax
            restrictions in the real-estate market. Larger developers may
            benefit from industry consolidation as smaller builders face a
            funding squeeze with a record amount of property trusts maturing
            next year and prices falling in the most cities in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Softening Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Home prices declined in 35 of China's 70 cities last month
            from April, the most since May 2012, official data showed June
            18. In the financial center of Shanghai, prices decreased 0.3
            percent, the first drop in two years, while they fell 0.2
            percent in the southern business hub of Shenzhen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Softening prices are good because they imply there isn't
            a bubble anymore,' said Ken Hu, Hong Kong-based chief
            investment officer of fixed income for Asia Pacific at Invesco,
            which manages $787 billion globally. 'We pick developers with
            high turnover and those who tend to build smaller-sized flats.
            Profit margin isn't that key to bondholders like us. Our
            approach is to buy on dips.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developers including Vanke that cut prices by 10 percent to
            15 percent achieved good sales volume, Deutsche Bank AG analysts
            led by Hong Kong-based Tony Tsang wrote in a June 13 report.
            Vanke, headquartered in Shenzhen, recorded a 16.2 percent
            increase in sales value in the first five months of 2014 from a
            year earlier, it said in a June 3 statement to the Shenzhen
            stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Taking Advantage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Larger industry players are able to tap overseas capital
            markets for funds. Sales of dollar bonds by Chinese companies
            totaled $91 billion in 2014, compared with $89 billion in the
            previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smaller builders, which rely on property trusts for
            financing, have to repay 203.5 billion yuan ($32.7 billion) in
            2015, according to research firm Use Trust. That's almost double
            the 109 billion yuan due this year. China's banking regulator
            said on June 6 it will monitor developer finances, a sign of
            concern defaults may spread after the March collapse of Zhejiang
            Xingrun Real Estate Co., a builder south of Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It won't be surprising to have a few defaults in the
            sector in an economic slowdown, given you have thousands of
            developers and many of them are small ones,' BOCI's Wang said.
            'The bigger ones, especially those listed, can take advantage
            to lower their funding costs as the industry consolidates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China South City Holdings Ltd. (1668), which runs logistics parks
            for industrial materials, sold 1 billion yuan of five-year bonds
            at a coupon of 7.5 percent in the interbank market on May 9. It
            plans to use the proceeds to repay short-term bank loans.
            Greenland Holding Group has hired banks to arrange investor
            meetings from today for a potential dollar bond offering,
            according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Borrowing Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vanke's bond borrowing costs dropped to 3.45 percent on a
            weighted average last week, compared with 5.5 percent in the
            first quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            It also managed to extend the average maturity of its notes to
            3.95 years, from 2.43 years in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slowing growth is causing declines in the yuan and onshore
            interest rates. The Chinese currency has fallen 2.8 percent
            against the dollar this year, the worst performance in Asia. The
            yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has dropped 52
            basis points to 4.04 percent in the same period as investors
            sought safe havens. Gross domestic product will probably expand
            7.3 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, according to
            a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Prolonged Downturn &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The downturn in the property market will be more prolonged
            this time than in previous corrections, Tom Byrne, senior vice
            president at Moody's, said at a June 19 conference in Shanghai.
            Broad price cuts are likely to come in late August or in
            September when more new projects are set to be introduced, UBS
            AG Hong Kong-based analyst Eva Lee wrote in a report last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moody's revised its credit outlook for Chinese developers
            to negative from stable on May 21. The Shanghai Stock Exchange
            Property Index, which tracks 24 real-estate companies listed in
            the city, has slumped 6.3 percent this year, exceeding the 4.2
            percent decline for the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Overall, the housing market is cooling in some parts,
            like in third- or fourth-tier cities,' said Chang at JPMorgan
            Asset. 'But we do see a silver lining. There's actually a
            healthy pickup in transactions at specific locations after some
            discounting.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Minor Stimulus' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation has introduced measures to help the real-estate
            industry, which JPMorgan Chase Co. says poses the biggest
            near-term risk to growth in the world's second-largest economy.
            The People's Bank of China told 15 banks in May to improve
            efficiency of service, give timely approval and distribution of
            mortgages to qualified buyers. The southeastern city of Fuzhou
            has removed home-purchase limits for buyers who make one-time
            payments, the Securities Times reported on June 18, citing sales
            people from two developers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government may announce additional 'minor stimulus
            measures' after Premier Li said in London last week that the
            nation will maintain a minimum growth rate of 7.5 percent,
            according to a China Securities Journal commentary on June 20.
            The PBOC may release more targeted steps to prevent expansion
            from falling short of the goal, it added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Policy makers are actually putting out more measures to
            support this sector,' said Arthur Lau, Hong Kong-based head of
            Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which
            oversees about $71 billion. 'I think, volume-wise, it could
            catch up a little bit in the second half, especially those who
            are not aggressively buying land. There is still a wide
            selection, even within this sector.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>So Long, Disinflation, as JPMorgan Sees Global Prices Rising</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The era of slowing global inflation looks to be over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three years of worldwide
            disinflation is ending, in the eyes of economists at JPMorgan Chase Co. Their estimates show global consumer
            prices accelerated 2.65 percent in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's the fastest pace since April 2012 and the
            level they'd targeted for the end of 2014. It marks a 0.6 percentage point jump since February, when the 2
            percent rate was the lowest since November 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not just food and energy costs.
            Inflation excluding those more volatile measures was still 2.1 percent in May. The hunch at the biggest U.S.
            bank is that companies are regaining pricing power as manufacturing strengthens, said David Hensley, an
            international economist at JPMorgan in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The analysis may surprise those
            investors who spent the year pushing up bond prices. It may also grate on economists such as Nobel laureate
            Paul Krugman, who yesterday bemoaned 'inflation hysteria' on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We definitely
            have seen the turn,' said Hensley in an interview. 'It would be an abrupt swing to go to worrying about the
            inflationary upside, but we may be seeing that shift taking place.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like JPMorgan,
            Societe Generale SA economist Aneta Merkowska told clients last week to 'prepare for the return of U.S.
            inflation.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Yellen Challenge &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;She predicts Federal Reserve Chair
            Janet Yellen will face consumer-price gains outside of food and energy of 2.3 percent by the end of the
            year. Import prices are bottoming, slack is eroding and housing and health-care costs are bouncing, she
            wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That could put the Fed behind the inflation curve, she said. Waiting
            to the middle of next year to raise their benchmark rate -- as markets and officials have indicated is
            likely -- would spell an unusually late start to tightening given the core rate may exceed 2.5 percent by
            then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fed raised rates in 2004 and 1999 when inflation was closer to 2 percent, said
            Merkowska, who predicts the Fed funds rate will be at 2.5 percent by the end of 2016, higher than the market
            bets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Krugman's hysteria accusation is hyperbolic itself given investor measures of
            inflation expectations do not suggest panic about prices, according to Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at
            Renaissance Macro Research LLC in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While faster wage growth has yet to
            materialize in the U.S., unemployment has fallen quicker than expected, banks are boosting lending and rents
            and medical care are becoming costlier, he told clients in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In the
            investment business it is much better to be prepared than surprised,' said Dutta. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Sell $304 Million Mortgage-Bond Issue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold bonds tied
            to about $304 million of U.S. home loans without government
            backing, adding to signs of life in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction included $171 million of top-rated
            securities paying a 3 percent coupon, which were sold at 102.2
            cents on the dollar, according to a person with knowledge of the
            offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
            authorization to speak publicly. That's about 1.5 cents on the
            dollar less than comparable benchmark Fannie Mae-guaranteed
            bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes are unlike other recent deals because they're
            backed almost entirely by 15-year mortgages, which are often
            taken by 'more financially secure' borrowers relative to more
            common 30-year loans, according to a presale report by Standard
            Poor's. The average size of the mortgages, at about $558,000,
            was also smaller than the $850,000 in previous JPMorgan deals
            since the 2008 financial crisis, SP said. They were mainly
            'jumbo' loans, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction's contracts included an 'untested and
            rigid' process for forcing JPMorgan or other originators of the
            underlying loans to buy back misrepresented debt, SP said.
            Seeing that 'the framework is more restrictive than those in
            other recent prime transactions, we imposed additional loss
            coverage requirements in our review.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While issuance of non-agency securities tied to new loans
            jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in 2012,
            sales collapsed after September, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
            totals about $2.1 billion this year, and Citigroup Inc. (C) has been
            also planning a sale this month. Offerings peaked at $1.2
            trillion in both 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
            government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
            $625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
            costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Abigail Jones Feder, JPMorgan Fixed-Income Executive, Dies at 51</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Abigail Jones Feder, a JPMorgan (JPM)
            Chase Co. managing director who oversaw cash and bond
            investments for the bank's private clients, has died. She was
            51. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She died on June 22 at New York University Langone Medical
            Center in Manhattan, following a long illness, according to her
            husband, Andrew Feder. Residents of Cold Spring Harbor on New
            York's Long Island, the couple shared their passion for sailing
            with their two children. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan Asset Management, Feder ran an investment team
            serving wealthy private-banking clients. She joined New York-based JPMorgan in 2000 as a vice president in
            the U.S. Fixed
            Income Group, overseeing short-term and intermediate domestic
            bonds. She spent the first 15 years of her career with Morgan
            Stanley Dean Witter Investment Management, in Manhattan, where
            she rose to head of enhanced cash management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She shared her finance expertise with the organizations
            that helped educate her, serving on the investment committees of
            the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island and the East Woods School
            and Christ Church in Oyster Bay, New York. She was on the Board
            of Managers of the Havens Relief Fund Society, which distributes
            funds to struggling New York City residents through a network of
            120 volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Spurring People' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She was very involved and truly altruistic,' Andrew
            Feder, a JPMorgan executive director who manages real estate
            investments on behalf of private banking clients, said yesterday
            in an interview. 'She was selfless in her view of the world.
            She gave of herself to many people, and she led by spurring
            people to do great things.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abigail Lispenard Jones was born on July 16, 1962, in
            Huntington, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her father, Edward Sprague Jones, was an art dealer,
            genealogist and illustrator whose work appeared in publications
            including the Nation and the New Republic, according to his 1997
            obituary in Princeton University's alumni magazine. Her mother,
            the former Patricia Bleecker, was executive director of the
            Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York from 1987 to 1997
            and a former president of the National Society of the Colonial
            Dames of America, which preserves historic properties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feder was a 1980 graduate of Phillips Academy in Andover,
            Massachusetts. She graduated in 1985 from Vassar College in
            Poughkeepsie, New York, where she was an art-history major and
            captain of the squash team, her husband said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Out of college she joined Morgan Stanley (MS)'s corporate-finance department and, in 1987, moved to
            Morgan Stanley's
            asset-management business as a marketing analyst, according to a
            filing by the Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust. She
            became a portfolio manager in the fixed-income group in 1989, a
            vice president in 1992, and head of a cash-reserves portfolio in
            1996. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to her husband, survivors include their son,
            Andries, 20, and daughter, Catalina, 17; her sister, Susanna A.
            Jones, head of the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland; and

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co. (KKR) has named four banks
            including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) to manage
            an initial public offering of French floor maker Tarkett SA,
            according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG and Bank of America Corp. have also been
            selected, the people said, asking not to be identified as the
            process isn't public. The IPO could raise about 500 million
            euros ($651 million) and is planned for the second half of the
            year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR, the private-equity firm run by Henry Kravis and George
            Roberts, sought to sell its 50 percent stake in Tarkett this
            year in a deal that would have valued the firm at as much as
            $3.8 billion, people familiar said March 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tarkett, which manufactures and sells PVC, wood, laminate,
            sports and other specialty flooring products, increased sales 11
            percent to 2.3 billion euros in 2012, helped by acquisitions and
            demand in Eastern Europe, Asia and North America. The company,
            based in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, has been jointly owned by
            KKR and the Deconinck family since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for KKR, Bank of America, JPMorgan, HSBC and
            Deutsche Bank declined to comment on any process. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hong Kong Stocks Fail to Lure JPMorgan With Worst Developed Drop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong stocks are set for the biggest decline among developed markets this half as concern about
            China's economy drives valuations 22 percent below the five-year average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng
            Index tumbled 9.8 percent in 2013, trailing the Standard Poor's 500 Index by the most in 15 years and wiping
            more than $145 billion from the value of shares. The losses dragged the gauge's valuation to 9.7 times
            estimates earnings, compared with a five-year average of 12.5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say Hong Kong stocks may get even cheaper as
            a manufacturing slowdown in China collides with the worst cash shortage in a decade. The waning outlook for
            the world's second-biggest economy is exacerbating declines spurred by the U.S. Federal Reserve's plan to
            dial back unprecedented stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We'll wait for a better entry point,' Grace
            Tam, a Hong Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan, which oversees about $1.5 trillion, said in a
            phone interview. 'China's data continues to be weak. They're not going to do any stimulus because they now
            want to focus on structural reforms and controlling credit activity.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng
            Index's drop, the biggest among 24 developed equity markets tracked by Bloomberg, compares with an 12
            percent climb for the SP 500. That's the Asian gauge's worst relative performance since the first half of
            1998, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Probe of JPMorgan's Madoff Ties Seen Snagged on Agency Rift</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is
            stalling a regulatory investigation of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s
            business dealings with convicted Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff,
            an inspector general told lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eric Thorson, the Treasury Department's internal watchdog,
            wrote to lawmakers on June 20 to complain that the Justice
            Department's civil division hasn't acted to move the case
            forward despite his request for assistance 'many weeks' ago,
            making it impossible to resolve 'an important issue involving
            one of the country's largest financial institutions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department doesn't comment publicly on internal
            deliberations. An official who spoke on condition of anonymity
            said the agency is continuing to review the complex legal issues
            involved and hasn't shelved the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The flap arises from an inquiry by the Office of the
            Comptroller of the Currency, a part of the Treasury, which has
            been reviewing JPMorgan's ties to Madoff. The former investment
            adviser maintained accounts with the bank for two decades before
            confessing to running a fraud that caused investors to lose
            about $17 billion in principal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thorson stepped into the fray when he was asked late last
            year by the OCC to make sure that JPMorgan wasn't impeding their
            investigation by withholding some documents under attorney-client privilege. The inspector general worked
            out an agreement

            Eric Thorson, the Treasury Department's internal watchdog, wrote to lawmakers on June 20 to complain that
            the Justice Department's civil division hasn't acted to move the case forward despite his request for
            assistance 'many weeks' ago, making it impossible to resolve 'an important issue involving one of the
            country's largest financial institutions.' Close

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. JPMorgan, Goldman, 16 Other Firms to End Analyst Surveys &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 26 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase Co. and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. were among 18 financial firms that agreed to
            stop participating in some surveys of analyst sentiment while
            New York investigates early access to the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Buffett Warns of Liquidity Curse, Celebrates Property Wagers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett, the billionaire
            chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., cited a farm he's owned
            since 1986 to caution individuals against frequent buying and
            selling of stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Ex-Jefferies Trader Customers Say Lies a Common Trade Tactic &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Ex-Jefferies Co. trader Jesse
            Litvak's former customers told a jury during his fraud trial in
            Connecticut that lies and misrepresentations are a common part
            of the give-and-take of bond trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. SP 500 Touches Record as Commodities Rise, Ukraine Stocks
            Surge &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. equities rallied, with the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index touching an intraday record and all
            but erasing its 2014 decline, amid confidence the economy is
            strong enough to weather cuts to monetary stimulus. Commodities
            gained while Ukrainian shares jumped the most since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Wall Street Hates $3,500 JPMorgan Fee for $1 Trillion Junk
            Loans &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- On Wall Street, $3,500 goes further
            than anyone dared imagine in the 1980s when the predecessor to
            JPMorgan Chase Co. charged the fee to trade each non-investment grade loan it sold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;6. SP 500 Extends Record as Treasuries Drop on Economic
            Optimism &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- The Standard Poor's 500 Index rose
            to another record and Treasuries fell amid improving U.S.
            consumer confidence and speculation the Federal Reserve will
            continue to support the economy. The euro strengthened after
            data showed faster-than-estimated inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;7. Ukraine Looks to IMF Bailout as Gunmen Storm Crimea Assembly &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Ukraine's new government started
            work on securing international financing to avert a default as
            separatist tensions flared in the southern Crimea region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;8. BlueCrest Internal Fund May Pose Pay Conflict, Albourne Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- BlueCrest Capital Management LLP,

            conflict of interest over a fund that it runs for the benefit of
            its partners, according to a report by one of the world's
            largest advisers to institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;9. RBS Posts Biggest Loss Since 2008 as McEwan Begins Overhaul &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
            posted the biggest full-year loss since its bailout in 2008 as
            Chief Executive Officer Ross McEwan outlined plans to return
            what he called the industry's least-trusted lender to profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10. SP 500 Reaches Record on Yellen as Yen Climbs; Sugar
            Advances &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks climbed, with the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index rising to a record, as Federal
            Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank may alter its
            strategy on stimulus cuts should the economy weaken. The yen
            gained on worsening Ukraine tensions while sugar surged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. Credit Suisse CEO Joins Wall Street Clueless Club: Jonathan
            Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 27 (Bloomberg) -- One of the best lines to come out of
            the financial crisis was by Michael Lewis in a March 2008 column
            for Bloomberg News: 'Jimmy Cayne plays bridge, and Stan O'Neal
            golfs while their firms collapse, not because they don't care
            their firms are collapsing, but because they don't know that
            their firms are collapsing,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Baldwin Yields Ground to Paparazzi: Margaret Carlson &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 25 (Bloomberg) -- If you're like me -- and I'm not
            advising it -- you sometimes read the reaction to an article
            before you read the article itself. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Eric Schneiderman Cracks Down on What's Legal: Jonathan Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Now that we know New York has an
            attorney general who makes up the law as he goes along when it
            comes to the securities industry, where will he draw the line? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. WhatsApp Changes Meaning of Work in America: William D. Cohan &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 25 (Bloomberg) -- By paying $19 billion in cash and
            stock for WhatsApp Inc.'s 55 employees -- $345 million apiece --
            Facebook Inc. has crystallized why it's been so difficult for
            the U.S. to climb out of the unemployment ditch dug by the 2008
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Japan's Partners Have Had Enough of the Weaker Yen: Jim
            O'Neill &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Being a currency isn't always easy.
            Sometimes they're asked to be weak. Weak can be good. But not
            too weak. That can be unneighborly, or cause inflation -- and if
            a currency weakens too fast, that might be a crisis. What's a
            currency to do? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Yellen Testifies on Federal Reserve Policy, U.S. Economy &lt;/h2&gt;

            financial markets and income inequality. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Credit Suisse CEO Dougan Testifies on U.S. Tax Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Brady Dougan, chief executive
            officer of Credit Suisse Group AG, testifies before the U.S.
            Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about the bank's
            efforts to comply with U.S. tax laws and the 'bad conduct' of
            some employees at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;4. $250,000 Equus Takes '60s Muscle Styling to the Max &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- When it comes to retro styling the
            major carmakers have nothing on Detroit's newcomer, Equus.
            Bloomberg's Matt Miller reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;5. World's Largest Floating Crane Arrives in New York &lt;/h2&gt;

            Gold &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 3 (Bloomberg) -- The Standard Poor's 500 Index
            dropped the most since June and emerging-market stocks extended
            the worst start to a year since 2009 as data from China to the
            U.S. signaled a slowdown in manufacturing. Treasuries rose and

            managing directors are leaving for Citadel LLC, joining the
            migration of traders leaving Wall Street banks for hedge funds
            as lenders pull back from riskier businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The founders of the Resolution

            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Payrolls rose less than projected in
            January and the jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to the lowest
            level in more than five years, clouding the outlook for the U.S.

            &lt;p&gt;1. Why Marrying Your Equal Can Boost U.S. Inequality: Peter
            Orszag &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Rich and poor Americans are slowly
            but surely staking out separate lives. Increasingly, they have
            been moving to different communities, and more and more they are
            also marrying people of similar income and educational
            backgrounds. This is a phenomenon social scientists call
            assortative mating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Credit Suisse CEO Joins Wall Street Clueless Club: Jonathan
            Weil &lt;/p&gt;

            Goldberg &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 14 (Bloomberg) -- This is a piece about a photograph I
            took in the gift shop at the Dachau concentration camp a couple
            of weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Buffett Drives Headline Writers Crazy: Jonathan Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Few things in journalism are more
            amusing than dueling headlines from competing news organizations
            on a big breaking financial news story. And we have some doozies
            to enjoy thanks to a disclosure yesterday by Berkshire Hathaway
            Inc. and Graham Holdings Co., former publisher of the Washington
            Post. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Buffett Pal Munger Is Head of Very Weird Company: Jonathan
            Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Charles Munger is the chairman of
            Daily Journal Corp., a small California newspaper publisher. He
            also is Warren Buffett's longtime business partner and Berkshire
            Hathaway Inc.'s vice chairman. So it's understandable why many
            investors would be curious to know what stocks Daily Journal
            owns. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Mario
            Draghi speaks at a news conference in Frankfurt about the
            decision to keep the main refinancing rate unchanged at 0.25
            percent, inflation expectations and the outlook for future rat
            cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Yellen Testifies on Federal Reserve Policy, U.S. Economy &lt;/h2&gt;

            Yellen delivers her semi-annual report on monetary policy before
            the House Financial Services Committee in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

            to present the Fed's semi-annual report to Congress. The
            hearing, originally scheduled for Feb. 13, was postponed by a
            snow storm. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Bank of England Governor Mark Carney
            speaks at a news conference about the bank's quarterly inflation
            report, forward guidance, interest-rate expectations and

            and Nils Blythe also speak. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Limited Extra Demand for Romania Debt on Index</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Extra demand for Romanian debt
            stemming from inclusion in an emerging-market bond index will be
            limited as investors have already boosted their holdings by $3.5
            billion through January, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank, which will incorporate three Romanian leu-
            denominated fixed-income securities in its GBI-EM index over
            three months starting March 1, had estimated total inflows of $2
            billion amid the inclusion, according to a research note sent to
            clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors have already increased their exposure to
            Romanian bonds and we expect extra demand from index inclusion
            to be limited,' JPMorgan said in the note. 'The potential
            future inclusion of additional Romanian bonds in the index,
            which depends on liquidity, may add to further demand.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leu-denominated bonds and the currency have rallied since
            January after JPMorgan said three of the country's local notes
            are eligible for index inclusion. Eleven Romanian notes are also
            eligible for entry to a Barclays Plc (BARC) emerging-market index,
            according to e-mailed comments from Societe Generale SA. (GLE) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The leu strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.3428 per euro by 7:53
            p.m. in Bucharest. It has gained 2.1 percent against Europe's
            common currency this year, the seventh-best performance among
            more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
            The yield on Romania's January 2016 bonds slid to 5.73 percent
            at an auction on Feb. 14, compared with a rate of 6.03 percent
            at a similar-maturity sale on Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Foreign Holders &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign investors' holding of Romanian debt rose to more
            than 20 percent in February from 5 percent in November,
            according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The increased interest from international investors helped
            the Finance Ministry raise a record 11.4 billion lei ($3.4
            billion) of local debt in January in addition to 503 million
            euros ($655 million) of bonds also sold domestically. It also
            raised 4.03 billion lei last month, more than the 3.7 billion
            lei planned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Romania's October 2015, January 2016 and July 2017 leu
            bonds are eligible for the JPMorgan index, phased in over a
            three-month period concluding on May 1, JPMorgan said in the
            note. Their final expected weight in the GBI-EM Global
            Diversified index is 0.87 percent, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That compares with the country's current weight of 0.29
            percent, Patrick Burton, a spokesman for the bank, said in an e-
            mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its estimate for Romania's economic growth
            to 1.5 percent this year from 0.8 percent, adding that it sees
            risks from the 'uncertainty around a new deal with the
            International Monetary Fund.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Expanding Argentine Business After Barclays Leaves</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is expanding
            its business in Argentina as the country remains a ''key'' market
            in the region, the bank's senior country officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is leasing an additional
            three floors in its headquarters in Buenos Aires and hiring
            about 15 people this year, Facundo Gomez Minujin said. The New
            York-based bank has operated its local investment unit in
            Argentina since 1985, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;''Argentina remains a key element of our JPMorgan franchise
            in Latin America,' Gomez Minujin wrote in an e-mail. 'In the
            last 12 months we have increased our headcount.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is expanding in South America's second-largest
            economy even as competitors have cut staff and closed divisions
            amid a tightening of currency controls and financial oversight
            by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government.
            Barclays Plc (BARC) closed its wealth management office in Buenos Aires
            in January 2012 'for strategic reasons' while Exotix, a
            brokerage, last year transferred some staff to New York and
            London due to regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gomez Minujin denied a report published today from Buenos
            Aires-based newspaper Clarin that the bank was leaving the
            country by the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're maintaining our presence Argentina just like we
            always have,' he said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seeks Bigger Payout With Smaller Buyback, CFO Lake Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, asked regulators to approve a higher quarterly
            dividend and reduced stock buyback after suffering its biggest
            trading loss ever last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We know that we would like to increase our dividend,'
            Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors during a
            Boston investor conference sponsored by Citigroup Inc. 'We did
            ask for buybacks, but lower than last year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve forced JPMorgan to suspend a $15
            billion share repurchase program last year after the lender
            disclosed derivatives losses that eventually swelled to more
            than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan's board of directors cut Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon's pay for 2012 in half after a
            review of the so-called London Whale episode held him partly
            responsible for the botched trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon previously told analysts that JPMorgan reduced its
            2013 buyback target by at least 20 percent to less than $3
            billion per quarter. The bank is projected to raise its 30-cent
            quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share, according to analysts
            surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The entire capital plan needs Fed approval as part of the
            central bank's annual review of the biggest U.S. lenders, with
            an answer expected by mid-March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're going to find out over the course of the next week
            or so whether or not we get our capital plan approved,' Lake
            said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stress Test &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan executives want to return more capital to
            shareholders, next year's payouts will depend on new
            international capital rules and how they affect the Fed's so-
            called stress test, Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We'll make our decision when we know how things shake out
            toward the end of this year,' Lake said. 'And we'd like to
            return capital back to shareholders. So we hope to have a chance
            to do that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased $1.6 billion shares before its buyback
            program was shut down last year. The Fed later approved the
            repurchase of $3 billion in additional shares in this year's
            first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of the original amount
            still unused. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon has said he's inclined to buy back shares when the
            price falls below tangible book value, a theoretical measure of
            what the company would be worth in a liquidation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Arqaam Tackles JPMorgan to Deutsche With Cape-to-Cairo Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Arqaam Capital Ltd., a Dubai-based
            investment bank focusing on emerging markets, said it plans to
            trade African bonds and derivatives after opening a brokerage in
            Johannesburg in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arqaam became the first broker to join Johannesburg's stock
            exchange in three years, pitting it against research teams from
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Renaissance Capital Holdings Ltd., Standard
            Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're under no illusions that this is a tough market,'
            Ross Abbott, head of Arqaam in South Africa, said in an
            interview in Johannesburg yesterday. 'We believe we'll be the
            first Cape-to-Cairo broker. We started with cash equities and
            we're looking at the bond market, derivatives and maybe asset
            management with an Africa fund.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arqaam plans to extend its coverage to the mining industry
            from the 49 African financial-services stocks it covers, before
            building research on consumer, real estate, aviation and other
            sectors, Abbott said. The firm plans to trade over-the-counter
            bonds and is focusing on countries including Kenya, Ghana,
            Nigeria, Morocco and Egypt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RenCap, the Russian investment bank controlled by
            billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, said Feb. 24 it had hired Rupert Preece to head sub-Saharan fixed-income
            trading as demand for
            African bonds increases. Last year Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
            switched its coverage of fixed income in sub-Saharan Africa from
            London to Johannesburg to boost emerging market revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Big Angle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our Middle Eastern products are the big angle here; we're
            the only ones in South Africa offering that reach,' Abbott
            said. 'And we have North Africa. RenCap also wants to be there
            -- we believe we'll be first.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zambia joins other African nations including Ghana and
            Kenya in selling dollar-denominated debt this year. Countries in
            the continent may sell as much as $5 billion in bonds by June,
            according to Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's probably a space for someone with feet on the
            ground in North Africa,' said Arno Lawrenz, chief investment
            officer at Cape Town's Atlantic Asset Management. 'But taking
            on North Africa credit risk right now -- that's like going into
            distressed debt. Do you need to go into that sort of environment
            to get a decent return? My sense is no.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arqaam, which offers trading and research services to
            institutions, has been visiting exchanges across the continent
            and there may be a 'strong push for sukuk,' Abbott said,
            commenting on Shariah-compliant bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Africa plans to sell a debut $500 million
            international sukuk this year and introduce two long-term
            domestic bonds as the nation diversifies its debt portfolio to
            reduce refinancing risks, the National Treasury said on Feb. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We would like to chat with the central bank about this,'
            Abbott said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Extends Deadline for Acceptance of Mortgage-Bond Accord</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to give
            mortgage-bond trustees evaluating a proposed $4.5 billion
            settlement over bad loans an extra three months to consider
            signing onto the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deadline was extended to June 16, according to a letter
            posted to a website for the settlement. Trustees including Bank
            of New York Mellon Corp., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo Co. (WFC)
            had asked the New York-based bank for the change in a letter
            dated March 4. Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan's general counsel,
            agreed to the request, the document shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The previous deadline was March 16, according to an earlier
            letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's tentative deal to offer payments to bond
            investors for mortgages that failed to match their promised
            quality is part of an effort by the largest U.S. bank to move
            past legal troubles tied in part to the housing crisis. The
            accord was announced in November during the week before the
            company agreed to a record $13 billion settlement with
            government agencies over faulty mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed that
            the deadline was pushed back and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $4.5 billion proposed accord was negotiated between
            JPMorgan and 21 institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK)
            and Pacific Investment Management Co. Trustees representing all
            investors in individual transactions must accept the deal. Hedge
            fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to continue
            separate lawsuits over some of the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs Bruns LLP representing
            the investors who negotiated the deal, declined to comment, as
            did Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Bank of New York, and Ari Cohen
            of Deutsche Bank and Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, UBS Convictions Overturned in Milan Swaps Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Deutsche Bank
            AG, UBS AG (UBSN) and Depfa Bank Plc won a bid to overturn a conviction
            for overseeing fraud by their bankers in the sale of derivatives
            to the city of Milan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An appeals court in Milan cleared the banks and individuals
            at the firms because 'the alleged crimes didn't take place,'
            Judge Luigi Martino said as he read out the verdict today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the appeals trial, prosecutor Piero de Petris had argued
            that the banks, in their roles as advisers to the municipality,
            should have disclosed how much the derivatives were costing the
            borrower. Defense lawyers cited testimony by municipal officials
            during the lower-court trial as proof the city was aware the
            four banks were making money on the trades and of the magnitude
            of those commissions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Deutsche Bank (DBK) welcomes today's verdict in the Appeals
            Court of Milan, which has confirmed that Deutsche Bank and its
            employees acted properly and in compliance with all laws and
            regulation,' the German bank said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Recoup Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Municipalities from Detroit to Naples have lost money on
            derivatives that were meant to lower borrowing costs and instead
            backfired. Italian local governments, including the city of
            Florence and the region of Piedmont, have sought to recoup their
            losses through legal action at home and in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan CFO Says $27 Billion Profit Outlook Isn't Target</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake said the $27 billion profit outlook the
            bank laid out at an investor conference last month wasn't a
            target and the firm can earn more than that. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's not a forecast, that's not a budget, it's a
            simulation, and it was really predicated only on those things
            that we're really certain of,' Lake said today in a Bloomberg
            Television interview with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker.
            'I think there's every reason to believe that it's biased to
            the conservative.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $27 billion outlook compares with net income of $17.9
            billion last year and $21.3 billion in 2012. At the firm's
            investor day in 2013, JPMorgan presented a scenario in which
            earnings could increase to $27.5 billion, while saying its
            target was $24 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's outlook only factored in the impact of higher
            interest rates and investments the firm has made in its business
            over the past few years, Lake said. It didn't include higher
            trading revenue, even as the bank 'absolutely expects' that
            business to grow over the next five years, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lake also said that rising costs from regulation will be
            'somewhat permanent.' Still, JPMorgan holds the 'best hand'
            among large banks and will continue to outperform rivals,
            according to Lake. She declined to forecast the maximum the bank
            could earn in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Investment Bank Revenue to Decline 11%, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The world's top investment banks
            may see combined revenue from trading, underwriting and advising
            on mergers drop 11 percent in the first quarter as clients cut
            back on activity, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) and UBS AG (UBSN) may post the biggest declines
            compared with the year-earlier period, down 15 percent and 14
            percent respectively, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in
            a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A decline in price swings and margins will contribute to a
            19 percent contraction in revenue from trading fixed-income,
            currencies and commodities, the analysts wrote. Sales from
            trading stocks are on course for a 6 percent decline in the
            quarter while revenue from advising on mergers and underwriting
            securities sales may rise 1 percent, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the global securities firms tracked by JPMorgan,
            Morgan Stanley (MS)'s investment-banking revenue may fall the least,
            or 7 percent, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 8 percent and Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS is JPMorgan's top pick because of its greater exposure
            to equity trading relative to FICC, while Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) is
            the analysts' favored stock with a large FICC business because
            of the firm's reorganization. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asset Management Selling Periphery Debt on Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management is
            reducing its holdings of Europe's higher-yielding debt as it
            bets a rally in the bonds is ending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gains have sent yields from Greece to Spain tumbling to the
            lowest since at least 2010 this month as data from gross
            domestic product to manufacturing output add to evidence the
            euro-area recovery is gathering pace. The rally has pushed the
            securities to levels that are no longer good value for
            investors, according to JPMorgan London-based money manager
            Talib Sheikh. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A year ago we were pounding the table that European
            peripheral debt was really cheap,' Sheikh said in an interview
            on Bloomberg Television's 'Countdown' with Anna Edwards and
            Mark Barton. 'With valuations where they are it's hard to make
            the case that peripheral bonds look a buying opportunity here so
            we've been reducing our exposure pretty aggressively into this
            rally.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management oversees the equivalent of $1.6
            trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to 3.36 percent on March
            10, the lowest level since October 2005. The additional yield
            investors demand to hold the securities over similar-maturity
            German bunds slid to 173 basis points on March 11, the least
            since June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rate on Spanish bonds due in April 2024 dropped to an
            eight-year low of 3.30 percent on March 10, reducing the
            security's yield spread over bunds to 165 basis points. That's
            the lowest level since October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While these spreads can narrow further 'it's hard to say
            that there's real value in those bonds any more,' Sheikh said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish bonds have returned 5.2 percent this year,
            according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy's have gained
            4.4 percent and Greece's have surged 17 percent. German
            securities have earned 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan U.S. Chief Equity Strategist Thomas Lee to Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Thomas Lee, the JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who has called for gains in American
            stocks (SPX) for six straight years and got them in four, is leaving
            the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, 44, is stepping down tomorrow after holding the job
            since 2007, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based
            firm, said in a telephone interview. Lee wants to take time away
            from work, according to a memo sent to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, who worked for JPMorgan for 15 years, is among almost
            two dozen Wall Street strategists who try to predict the
            direction of the stock market and advise investors on which
            companies to buy and sell. He had one of the highest year-end
            forecasts for the Standard Poor's 500 Index, telling investors
            last week to stay bullish and buy health-care, technology and
            financial stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He's just one of the best strategists in the game,'
            Philip Orlando, who helps oversee nearly $400 billion as chief
            equity-market strategist at Federated Investors Inc., said in a
            phone interview. 'I'm surprised and disappointed that a young
            guy at the top of his game would be resigning.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, a managing director at the largest U.S. bank, didn't
            respond to a telephone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Always Bullish &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
            chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual rise of
            14 percent in the SP 500 over the period. He was more accurate
            than the average of strategist forecasts in four of the six
            years, including 2012 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like every one of his competitors tracked by Bloomberg, Lee
            failed to foresee the stock-market decline in 2008. He called
            for an 8.3 percent increase in the SP 500 that year. The
            benchmark gauge plummeted 38 percent in its worst annual
            performance since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before taking the strategist job, he covered the wireless
            and telecommunications industry from 1999 to 2007 and added
            small-cap stocks in 2004, being recognized by Institutional
            Investor magazine every year since 1998, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He held positions at Oppenheimer Co., Kidder Peabody
            Co. and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. He received a bachelor's
            degree in economics in 1991 from the Wharton School at the
            University of Pennsylvania with dual concentrations in finance
            and accounting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Good Reputation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He has a good reputation,' Hugh Johnson, who oversees $2
            billion as chairman of Albany, New York-based Hugh Johnson
            Advisors LLC. Strategists 'are helpful in thinking about
            issues,' he said. 'They can tell you what the issues are and
            give you interesting ways to analyze the issues.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 will probably end the year at 2,075, Lee said
            in a March 7 report. Only Weeden Co. and Canaccord Genuity
            Securities LLC have higher estimates, according to a survey
            compiled by Bloomberg of 21 strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the year, Lee stuck to his bullish
            stance even as the SP 500 slid as much as 5.8 percent in
            February. He was ultimately proved correct as the equities
            benchmark recovered the losses by the end of the month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His predictions during the rebound were more accurate. His
            target of 1,100 for the U.S. equity benchmark in 2009 was only
            off by 15 points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'His viewpoints have been very much on the money and he
            will do well wherever he goes,' John Manley, who helps oversee
            about $233 billion as chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo
            Funds Management in New York, said in a phone interview.
            'Hopefully, he reappears somewhere else.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to HSBC Face EU Rate-Rigging Fines From Almunia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) face a European Union complaint as soon as
            next month as the bloc's antitrust chief races to fine a quartet of financial companies that snubbed
            rate-rigging settlements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joaquin Almunia, whose term ends on Oct. 31, is determined to
            punish the two banks as well as Credit Agricole SA (ACA) and interdealer broker ICAP Plc (IAP) before he
            leaves office, said three people familiar with the probe who asked not to be named because the process is
            private. To meet the target, he plans to send so-called statements of objections in the Euribor and Libor
            cases close to Easter, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He will want to end on a high note,'
            Pierre-Henri Conac, a professor specializing in banking at the University of Luxembourg, said in an
            interview. 'He'll be happy to say: 'I did it.'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almunia, 65, sees the fines as
            unfinished business after the four holdouts ruined his attempt to get a clean sweep of settlements in
            rate-rigging cases, part of a global scandal that tarnished the reputation of some of the world's biggest
            lenders. The next seven months are the last chance for the former Spanish economist to burnish his legacy
            after he pledged to quit political life when he leaves the European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Set to Cash in on Deals From SFR to ONO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) are set for a fee bonanza with both banks playing roles on
            the sale of Vivendi SA (VIV)'s French wireless unit, and Vodafone
            Group Plc (VOD)'s purchase of a Spanish cable company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based banks are advisers on Altice SA (ATC)'s effort
            to acquire Vivendi's SFR unit in a $28 billion deal, and also
            Vodafone's agreement to buy Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for $10
            billion. If completed, the SFR purchase will be the second-largest globally this year, and the two
            transactions could
            generate as much as $173 million in advisory fees for Morgan
            Stanley, JP Morgan and other banks, according to estimates from
            New York-based research firm Freeman Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan are currently the top advisers
            so far this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Dealmakers
            are having their strongest start to the year since before the
            global financial crisis amid growing economic confidence and
            rising share prices. Deals in technology, media and
            telecommunications continue to drive overall activity, with five
            of the top 10 being in that space, including the proposed SFR
            purchase, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vivendi is in exclusive talks with Altice to sell for an
            enterprise value of 20 billion euros, or $28 billion, according
            to its billionaire owner Patrick Drahi. A deal could be
            completed by the end of the month, Drahi said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If that deal closes, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley could
            split as much as $52 million as advisers to Altice, while
            Vivendi's banks Citigroup Inc. and Lazard Ltd. could share as
            much as $59 million, according to Freeman estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan will share in up to $35 million of fees
            with three other banks that advised Ono on its 7.2 billion euro
            sale to Vodafone. Deutsche Bank AG was the lead adviser to Ono's
            shareholders, and Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG were co-advisers along with JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For its part as an adviser to Vodafone, Morgan Stanley will
            split as much as $27 million with Robertson Robey Associates
            LLP, which separately advised the buyer's board, Freeman's
            estimates show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BlackRock Hires JPMorgan's Jones as Stock Investment Chief</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK) hired JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM)'s Christopher Jones as chief investment officer for stocks
            in the Americas as the world's biggest money manager seeks to
            bolster its active equity business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jones, who was CIO for JPMorgan Asset Management's growth
            and small-cap U.S. equity team, will join New York-based
            BlackRock in a few months as head of the active stock unit in
            the Americas, according to an internal memo provided by
            BlackRock and sent today to the firm's employees. Jones, 53,
            replaces Chris Leavy, who went on medical leave in June of last
            year. He will also serve as global co-head of fundamental
            equity, alongside Nigel Bolton, head of BlackRock's European
            equity team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, who built
            BlackRock through a series of acquisitions to manage $4.3
            trillion, is seeking to improve fund performance in the stock
            unit to attract assets amid a five-year rally in equities. A
            push by Leavy to replace managers and focus on returns helped
            BlackRock's active U.S. stock funds beat 54 percent of rivals
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a great opportunity to take market share in many
            areas of the actively managed business over the next few
            years,' Quintin Price, global head of active strategies, said
            in the memo. 'I am sure Chris Jones's arrival will help us
            maximize our impact,' said Price, who had been filling in for
            Leavy on an interim basis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Replacement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jones managed strategies including JPMorgan's $15.5 billion
            Large Cap Growth Fund (OLGAX) and $1.2 billion Small Cap Growth Fund.
            The retail shares of the large cap fund returned an annual 23
            percent a year over the past five years, ahead of 82 percent of
            similarly managed funds, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The small cap one delivered 29 percent annually over
            the past five years, beating 83 percent of peers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in
            history in 1982, Jones joined Robert Fleming Co. which was was
            bought by Chase Manhattan in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eytan Shapiro, who has worked on JPMorgan's small cap team
            since 1992, will take over as head of the growth team, according
            to Kristen Chambers, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan.
            Shapiro will report to Paul Quinsee, head of U.S. equity at
            JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Improving Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leavy, 42, joined BlackRock in 2010 from OppenheimerFunds
            Inc. and in 2012 added oversight of the large-capitalization
            stock funds previously led by former equity chief investment
            strategist Robert Doll. Tasked with improving performance he
            brought in money managers such as Bartlett Geer from Putnam
            Investments LLC and UBS AG's Lawrence Kemp. During his tenure
            Leavy replaced managers at strategies that represented about 40
            percent of the division's $115 billion at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While performance has picked up, BlackRock's active U.S.
            stock funds still trail 62 percent of peers on an annualized
            basis in the three years ended Dec. 31, according to Chicago-based research firm Morningstar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clients pulled $15.4 billion from BlackRock's active stock
            funds last year, while depositing $74 billion into its exchange-traded funds, according to a company filing.
            Industrywide,
            investors put $161 billion into equity mutual funds in 2013,
            based on data from the Investment Company Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Continue Overseeing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Price said in the memo that Leavy, who left in June to
            treat his diabetes and a related cardiovascular condition, won't
            be returning to BlackRock this year. Leavy has been aware and
            supportive of the plan to identify a new CIO if he couldn't
            return to his role, Price said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In January, BlackRock said Bolton, also the CIO of
            international fundamental equity, was facing a civil proceeding
            by an Italian securities regulator alleging he used nonpublic
            information to avoid losses for clients last year. A BlackRock
            spokesman at the time said the firm had fully cooperated with
            the regulator and conducted its own investigation and found no
            evidence to support the regulator's allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter Stournaras will continue to oversee BlackRock's
            large-cap funds, such as the $1.8 billion BlackRock Large Cap
            Core Fund and the $864 million BlackRock Large Cap Value Fund,
            which he had co-managed with Leavy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Replicate Success &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fink has said he hopes the equity unit can replicate the
            success of BlackRock's bond unit in improving performance and
            attracting deposits. In 2012, the firm reorganized its bond
            business to give unit heads Rick Rieder and Kevin Holt greater
            autonomy and accountability. In 2013, BlackRock's active bonds
            attracted $10.4 billion, as fixed-income rivals such as Pacific
            Investment Management Co. faced redemptions amid investor fears
            of rising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see a huge market for us in the active equity space,'
            Fink said during a conference call with analysts in January.
            'You have to start with performance before you can get
            involved.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Entel Jumps in Chile as JPMorgan Says Peru Beating Undue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Empresa Nacional de
            Telecomunicaciones SA, Chile's second-largest wireless operator,
            rose the most in six months after JPMorgan Chase Co. said it
            offers faster growth than competitors at an attractive price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 5.1 percent to 6,530 pesos at 4:30 p.m.
            in Santiago, the most since Sept. 23. It was the best performer
            on the benchmark IPSA index, which rose 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised its recommendation on Entel to the
            equivalent of buy from neutral. The company's earnings before
            interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will climb at an
            average annual rate of 9 percent through 2018, compared with 6
            percent for Tim Participacoes SA and 1 percent for America Movil
            SAB, according to analysts at the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Current valuations do not reflect Entel's superior growth
            profile,' analysts Andre Baggio and Marcelo Santos wrote in a
            report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock price is 10.3 times its trailing 12 months of
            earnings, versus an average 15.7 times for regional peers,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Entel's shares have lost 33 percent since April 4, when
            Entel said it would pay $400 million for Nextel Peru, a unit of
            NII Holdings Inc. The IPSA fell 17 percent in the same span. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nextel Peru had a loss before interest, tax, depreciation
            and amortization of $36 million in 2012, according to an April 4
            report from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe investors overreacted to this acquisition, and
            that Entel is a compelling stock,' the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Agrees to Sell Commodities Unit for $3.5 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will sell its
            physical commodities unit to Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. for $3.5
            billion, ending a five-year foray into owning and storing raw
            materials amid pressure from regulators to leave the business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, disclosed in a statement from New York-based
            JPMorgan today, takes the bank out of industries such as
            petroleum products and power while cementing Mercuria's standing
            among the world's biggest commodity traders. JPMorgan will
            continue to provide services and products tied to commodities
            including financing, market-making and the vaulting and trading
            of precious metals, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our goal from the outset was to find a buyer that was
            interested in preserving the value of JPMorgan's physical
            business,' Blythe Masters, head of the company's global
            commodities operations, said in the statement. 'Mercuria is a
            global leader in the commodities markets and an excellent long-term home.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is selling amid concern among regulators that
            banks could control prices if they own commodities as well as
            trade them, or suffer catastrophic losses that would endanger
            the financial system. The Federal Reserve said in July it might
            force insured lenders to get out, and JPMorgan agreed later that
            month to pay $410 million to settle claims that it manipulated
            power markets, without admitting wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Colombia Bonds Surge With Peso as JPMorgan Plans Weighting Boost</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's benchmark peso bonds
            climbed the most since July and the peso rallied after JPMorgan
            Chase Co. said it planned to raise the Andean country's
            weighting on two of its indexes starting May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The price of peso bonds, or TES, maturing in 2024 climbed
            1.955 centavos to 122.484 centavos per peso at the close in
            Bogota trading, according to data from the central bank. Yields
            plunged 24 basis points, or 0.24 percentage point, to 6.88
            percent, the lowest level since Jan. 22. The peso gained 1
            percent to 2,009.60 per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's weighting on the GBI-EM Global Diversified index
            may rise to 8.05 percent from 3.24 percent and that on the GBI-EM Global index may increase to 5.6 percent
            from 1.81 percent,
            JPMorgan said. Turkey, Russia, Thailand, Indonesia and Hungary
            may have a reduced weighting, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors are anticipating more inflows into the TES
            market,' Juan David Ballen, an analyst at Alianza Valores
            brokerage, said in a phone interview in Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's TES bonds will probably rally further, according
            to Kenneth Lam, a Latin America currency and rates strategist at
            Citigroup in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The weight increase should generate very significant
            inflows into TES bonds,' Lam wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The weightings will be increased 'as a result of improved
            transparency and accessibility for international investors in
            the local TES market,' JPMorgan said in its report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five securities including TES due in 2016, 2018, 2022, 2024
            and 2028 will be included in a 'phased approach' starting May
            30 and ending Sept. 30, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The impact on the peso 'could be more muted compared to
            bonds, since a portion of the inflow is likely to be hedged,'
            Citi's Lam wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) appointed Asif
            Raza to lead its corporate banking business for the Middle East
            and North Africa as it expands in the oil-rich region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raza will report to Sjoerd Leenart, senior country officer
            for MENA and Jose Linares, head of the corporate banking
            division for Europe, Middle East and Africa, according to a memo
            obtained today by Bloomberg News. The contents of the document
            were confirmed by a bank spokeswoman. Raza was previously head
            of treasury and investor services in the region for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is boosting its presence in the
            Middle East, hiring executives from banks including Nomura
            International Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc. It promoted Rayan Fayez
            as senior country officer for Saudi Arabia in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender appointed Ali Moosa as head of treasury
            services for MENA, replacing Raza. Moosa will also retain his
            role as senior country officer for Bahrain, Egypt Lebanon and
            also report to Leenart, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Trader Martin-Artajo Challenges Regulator</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, the former
            JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Co. banker fighting U.S. extradition from Spain
            over trading losses that surpassed $6.2 billion, is challenging
            the U.K. financial regulator in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, who oversaw synthetic credit trading at the
            bank's chief investment office in London, filed the case against
            the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority at a tribunal last week,
            according to the court's website. No other details about the
            claim were available. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was indicted in Manhattan federal court in September for
            allegedly helping to hide losses caused by Bruno Iksil, the
            Frenchman who became known as the London Whale. The U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission said in a parallel lawsuit
            that Martin-Artajo and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for
            him, engaged in a scheme to enhance the portfolio's apparent
            performance and thereby curry favor with their supervisors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, who led the international CIO at New York-based JPMorgan during the losses, filed
            a separate challenge
            against the FCA in October. Macris was 'deprived of the
            opportunity of responding' to the regulator regarding its
            findings in the case, his lawyers said at the time. The
            documents in both cases aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA fined JPMorgan 138 million pounds ($228 million) in
            September and found that the CIO's London management
            deliberately misled them. Neither Macris nor Martin-Artajo were
            mentioned by name in the regulator's report on the fine, and
            neither were accused of wrongdoing by the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Finance Tribunal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo's cases were filed at a finance tribunal
            which is limited to reviewing disputes involving challenges to
            decisions by U.K. regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA, declined to
            comment. Lista Cannon, a lawyer for Martin-Artajo in London, and
            William Leone, his attorney in New York, didn't immediately
            respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo, a Spanish citizen, asked a court in Madrid
            in November not to extradite him because the alleged events
            happened in the U.K. rather than the U.S., and because he has
            roots in Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leone told a court in New York earlier this year that his
            client isn't a fugitive. Grout and Martin-Artajo have denied
            wrongdoing, while Iksil is cooperating in the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-05677, and U.S.
            v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Colombia Peso Posts World-Beating Weekly Rally on JPMorgan Shift</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's peso posted the biggest
            weekly gain among all of the world's currencies on speculation
            inflows will rise after JPMorgan Chase Co. said it planned to
            raise the country's weighting on two of its indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The peso appreciated 2.4 percent to 1,994.51 per U.S.
            dollar this week, the most since June 2012. The currency fell
            0.1 percent at the close of trading in Bogota today after the
            central bank held the target lending rate at 3.25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said March 19 that it will probably more than
            double the weighting of Colombia's peso bonds in its GBI-EM
            Global Diversified Index to 8.05 percent from 3.24 percent
            starting May 30, citing the government's effort to increase
            access to foreigners. The index is used as a benchmark by firms
            that manage around $195.7 billion, JPMorgan strategists
            including Holly Huffman wrote in a separate report that day. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The possible amount of portfolio inflows that could
            arrive to Colombia is significant,' Credit Suisse analyst Juan Lorenzo Maldonado wrote today in a research
            report to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Public Credit Director Michel Janna said in an interview
            last week that the nation may reduce a tax on foreigners' bond
            profits to less than 5 percent or eliminate it entirely.
            Colombia chopped foreigners' taxes to 14 percent from 33 percent
            in January 2013 to spur demand and cut borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said that it will add Colombian peso bonds, or
            TES, due in June 2016, November 2018, May 2022, July 2024 and
            April 2028 to its index in a 'phased approach' starting May 30
            and ending Sept. 30. The bank will also include the securities
            in its GBI-EM Global index, probably boosting the weighting to
            5.6 percent from 1.81 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dollar Purchases &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's central bank announced today it will extend its
            dollar purchase program to as much as $1 billion from April to
            June. Policy makers had said the bank will buy as much as $1
            billion in the first quarter. It bought $11.5 million today and
            has purchased $542.5 million this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers left the overnight lending rate unchanged
            today at 3.25 percent for a 12th straight month, as expected by
            all 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The decision was
            unanimous, central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe told reporters
            in Bogota after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The weighting increase 'can compensate to some degree the
            impact that the adjustment in global liquidity has on the
            exchange rate and interest rates in the Colombian market,' the
            central bank said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The price of benchmark peso bonds maturing in 2024 climbed
            0.545 centavo to 124.375 centavos per peso today, according to
            data from the central bank. Yields fell six basis points, or
            0.06 percentage point, to 6.66 percent. They were down 46 basis
            points for the week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sued by Investor Over 'Culture of Lawlessness'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and directors
            including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon were sued by an
            investor for creating 'a culture of lawlessness' that led to
            billions of dollars in settlements tied to mortgage-backed
            securities and Bernard Madoff's Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under Dimon's leadership, the New York-based company sold
            low-quality residential mortgage-backed securities, failed to
            report questionable activity by Madoff, manipulated energy
            markets and engaged in fraudulent credit-card billing
            strategies, the Iron Workers Mid-South Pension Fund said in
            papers filed March 17 in Delaware Chancery Court and partly
            unsealed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, CEO since December 2005 and chairman since December
            2006, 'knowingly, recklessly, or with gross negligence created
            a culture of lawlessness' that resulted in fines, penalties
            settlements and related costs totaling at least $20 billion last
            year, the fund said. At the same time, Dimon received a
            74 percent pay raise to $20 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, agreed in
            November to a $13 billion settlement of government allegations
            that it misled investors and public when it sold bonds backed by
            faulty residential mortgages. U.S. and state officials blamed
            JPMorgan's actions for helping to cause the credit crisis that
            led to the worst recession since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's China Investment Banking CEO Fang Fang to Leave Firm</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fang Fang, JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co.'s
            chief executive officer of investment banking for China, is
            leaving after more than 12 years at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 48-year-old banker told New York-based JPMorgan that he
            wanted to retire, according to an internal memo obtained by
            Bloomberg News today. Frank Gong was named chairman of China
            investment banking in the message from Therese Esperdy, co-head
            of Asia-Pacific banking at the firm. Marie Cheung, a spokeswoman
            in Hong Kong, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fang's impending departure comes amid an investigation into
            JPMorgan's Asian hiring practices. U.S. authorities are
            examining whether the firm employed people in Asia so that their
            relatives in government would steer business to the bank, people
            with knowledge of the probes have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fang joined JPMorgan in August 2001 and was a former vice
            president of Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd., an investment
            company controlled by the government of China's capital. He
            became head of JPMorgan's China investment-banking business in
            2007 and was made vice chairman for Asia investment banking in
            2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banker submitted his resignation last week as he wants
            to spend more time with his family, a person with knowledge of
            the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Carlyle Hires JPMorgan's Cavanagh in Push to Diversify</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            executive Mike Cavanagh arrives at Carlyle Group LP (CG) this summer,
            he'll be asked to expand a firm that's fallen behind rivals even
            as it delivers some of the best returns in private equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carlyle, the second-largest manager of alternative
            investments such as private-equity funds and real estate, has
            increased its assets at a 13 percent annual rate in the past two
            years, the slowest pace among peers, according to calculations
            by Bloomberg. Blackstone Group LP (BX), the largest private-equity
            manager, expanded at a 26 percent pace, the same as KKR Co.
            and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) grew at a 46 percent rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, 48, until today co-chief of investment banking at
            JPMorgan and a close deputy to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, will need to find ways to further
            diversify Carlyle from
            private equity and expand assets. He will share a co-president
            role with Glenn Youngkin, a 19-year veteran of the firm,
            Washington-based Carlyle said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Youngkin, 47, who became chief operating officer in 2011,
            has spent the past three years deciding which businesses Carlyle
            should enter and which it shouldn't, a role Cavanagh will share
            as the firm's founders seek ways to give more daily
            responsibilities to deputies. The move puts two executives in
            their late-40s in charge of running the buyout firm underneath
            its three billionaire founders, Bill Conway, Dan D'Aniello and
            David Rubenstein, who are in their mid-60s. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fresh Perspectives' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh 'will help ensure that Carlyle continues to
            innovate and grow for another quarter-century,' Conway and
            Rubenstein, the firm's co-CEOs, said in the statement. The
            executives, who started Carlyle in 1987 with D'Aniello, expect
            Cavanagh's hire to 'enable fresh perspectives in an environment
            that embraces change.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carlyle fell 1 percent to close at $31.35 in New York as
            JPMorgan declined 0.2 percent to $60.93. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carlyle's stock has trailed rivals, gaining 2.1 percent in
            the past 12 months, compared with 67 percent at Blackstone, 42
            percent at Apollo and 24 percent at KKR. Blackstone, Apollo and
            KKR are all based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adena Friedman, Carlyle's chief financial officer, said on
            a February call with investors that expenses have increased as
            the firm hires for fundraising and makes strategic purchases to
            boost revenue. Carlyle last year agreed to acquire Diversified
            Global Asset Management Co. to broaden its hedge-fund offerings,
            bought Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management LLC as a
            property fund-of-funds operation, and added the remaining 40
            percent of Dutch investment manager AlpInvest Partners NV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Expenses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We should expect the fact that our expenses will grow,'
            Friedman said on the Feb. 19 call. 'But so should our revenues.
            When we make investments in new initiatives and new funds, we do
            try to make sure that we do it properly, but it should result in
            revenue growth for us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even with recent acquisitions, Carlyle relies more on
            leveraged buyout profits, which are produced in lumpy intervals,
            and less on predictable management fees than its peers,
            according to Morgan Stanley analyst Matt Kelley in New York.
            Public investors put a higher value on stable fees, which can
            keep analysts and investors 'on the sidelines,' he said in a
            January note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As a result, Carlyle plans to start three new investment
            strategies a year on average, Youngkin said in November at the
            firm's first investor day. Rapid expansion is 'part of the
            game' that Blackstone, Apollo and KKR are also engaged in, said
            Youngkin, who until now has largely overseen the rollout of new
            business lines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Great Hire' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh and Carlyle began talks over a potential role in
            the second half of last year, according to a person familiar
            with the discussions, who requested anonymity to discuss private
            plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a great hire for Carlyle,' Chris Kotowski, an
            analyst at Oppenheimer Co. in New York, said of Cavanagh's
            move in a telephone interview. 'He's an incredibly competent
            and versatile manager.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chris Ullman, a Carlyle spokesman, declined to comment on
            Cavanagh's role beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carlyle said Cavanagh will be a member of its executive
            group, currently a six-person committee that makes strategic
            decisions for the firm. He joins the three founders, Youngkin,
            Friedman and Jeff Ferguson, the company's general counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carlyle earlier this month hired former General Motors Co.
            CEO Dan Akerson as vice chairman of the board, under Chairman
            D'Aniello. Akerson was head of global buyouts and co-head of
            U.S. buyouts at the firm before joining GM in 2009 after its
            rescue by the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lee, Chappuis &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In November, Carlyle looked outside the firm for a deputy
            chief investment officer under Conway, hiring Kewsong Lee from
            private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC. Lee had been at New
            York-based Warburg Pincus for 21 years and was instrumental in
            dozens of deals, including the buyout of Neiman Marcus Group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier in the year, Jacques Chappuis left Morgan Stanley
            to run Carlyle's funds-of-funds business. Chappuis was hired to
            expand the solutions group in the same way Mitch Petrick, who
            joined the firm from Morgan Stanley in 2010, was asked to build
            Carlyle's Global Markets Strategies unit, which manages more
            than $35 billion in hedge-fund and structured-credit
            investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 31, the buyout firm had invested in more than
            470 corporate transactions, returned an average of 30 percent
            annually to investors, and oversaw almost $189 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Loses Potential Successor to Dimon as Cavanagh Quits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Mike Cavanagh, who served as a close deputy to Chief Executive Officer Jamie
            Dimon for more than two decades, will leave to become co-chief operating officer of Carlyle Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh, 48, was seen internally as a potential successor to Dimon, 58, who has told people he
            wants to remain CEO for another five years, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, asking not to
            be identified discussing personnel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Top bankers and traders have left the biggest Wall
            Street firms for more lucrative jobs in private equity and at hedge funds, as regulation of lenders has
            intensified following the financial crisis and lower returns have pushed banks to cut the amount of revenue
            they set aside for compensation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The regulatory landscape definitely makes it less
            enticing for some of these great managers to stay at the big banks, and the talent drain will continue,'
            said Glenn Schorr, an analyst at New York-based International Strategy Investment Group LLC. 'It's a
            significant loss for JPMorgan and a huge win for Carlyle, no two ways about it.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uncertainty
            about when the CEO job would become available also may have contributed to Cavanagh's decision, Matt
            Burnell, a Wells Fargo Co. analyst, wrote in a note to investors. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Peregrine Bankruptcy Trustee Ends Dispute With JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Peregrine Financial Group Inc.'s
            trustee agreed to settle a dispute with JPMorgan Chase Co. in
            a deal that will bring more than $15 million to creditors of the
            commodities firm, which filed for bankruptcy after its founder
            looted client accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the agreement filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy
            Court in Chicago, JPMorgan will pay $1.25 million and release
            $14 million in cash it's holding as collateral for its claim
            against Peregrine. JPMorgan also agreed to reduce the size of
            that claim, the trustee, Ira Bodenstein, said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal 'secures a favorable compromise that
            substantially reduces the estate's costs and downside risk with
            respect to the JPMorgan claims,' according to Bodenstein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peregrine, a Cedar Falls, Iowa-based commodities firm with
            offices in Chicago, filed for bankruptcy to liquidate in 2012
            after the National Futures Association said more than $200
            million in customer funds were missing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's founder, Russell Wasendorf Sr., now serving a
            50-year prison sentence for fraud and embezzlement, stole mostly
            from customers who traded on U.S. exchanges, the trustee said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A group of customers that had sued Wasendorf and JPMorgan
            for $200 million also agreed to be part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the bankruptcy was filed, New York-based JPMorgan
            claimed Peregrine owed it $2.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
            comment on the trustee's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In re Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-bk-27488, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern
            District of Illinois
            (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fraternity Chief Feared for Son as Hazings Spurred JPMorgan Snub</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Early this month, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) stopped managing an investment account for a prominent
            client: the charitable foundation of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, one of the U.S.'s largest fraternities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank was concerned about SAE's bad publicity, according to Anthony Alberico, a JPMorgan vice
            president who dealt with the foundation. SAE has had 10 deaths linked to drinking, drugs and hazing since
            2006, more than any other fraternity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If JPMorgan is going to turn us down, who's
            next?' said Bradley Cohen, SAE's national president. 'What if universities start saying SAE's not welcome?'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More from the Broken Pledges series:&lt;/p&gt;
            Fraternity Grapples With 'Historic' Pledging Ban
            U.S. Fraternity Abolishes Pledging for New Members
            Frat's Icy 'Torture' of Pledges Evokes Tarantino Films
            &lt;p&gt;The snub by the largest U.S. bank validated a startling decision that Cohen, seeking to protect
            future members, had already reached. On March 7, the same day JPMorgan formally cut ties with the
            fraternity, the 51-year-old Cohen announced an end to one of SAE's defining traditions: pledging, the
            months-long initiation where recruits sometimes fall prey to brutal hazing. The move catapulted Cohen into
            national prominence and drew criticism from alumni such as Texas oilman-turned-investor T. Boone Pickens.
            SAE became one of only a handful of 75 national fraternities to eliminate pledging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'How
            much longer can we sustain these losses -- loss of life, loss of credibility to those who join and drop out
            because they were lied to, loss of valuable resources and loss of our reputation as leaders and as true
            gentlemen,' Cohen told SAE brothers this month at the University of La Verne in California during his first
            public address since the announcement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Secret Handshake &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen, who
            took office only nine months ago, faced intense pressure to change the culture of SAE, according to him and
            other top fraternity officials. Besides JPMorgan, Lloyd's of London was threatening to cancel SAE's
            insurance coverage because of injuries, deaths and lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Family considerations also
            motivated Cohen. He wanted to protect his older son, Devon, a high school freshman who is determined to join
            SAE in college. Devon wears bow ties in purple and gold -- SAE's colors -- and knows its secret handshake.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I don't want him to be scarred mentally from hazing,' said Brad Cohen, relaxing with
            his family in their home near Los Angeles. 'I don't want him to want to join SAE so badly that he'll do
            anything he's told.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Backlash Stirred &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen's pledging ban has
            stirred a backlash from some student and alumni members of SAE, which was founded at the University of
            Alabama in 1856 and has more than 240 chapters and 14,000 college members. Cohen, who must step down at the
            end of his term next year, took the chance that traditionalists could unseat his allies on the board at the
            fraternity's next convention in 2015, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renowned as a Wall Street pipeline, SAE
            boasts prominent alumni such as hedge fund managers David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and Paul Tudor Jones
            of Tudor Investment Corp. Pickens, whom Cohen consulted before announcing the pledging ban, said through a
            spokesman that he has reservations about it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Pickens believes pledgeship is a key
            part of fraternity life and helps those who go through it gain an appreciation for the rich history tied to
            each fraternity,' spokesman Jay Rosser said in an e-mail. Pickens supports a 'greater focus' on alcohol and
            drug awareness, Rosser said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Either way, he appreciates the tough choice Brad Cohen has
            made,' Rosser said. 'Time will tell if it was a good one.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SAE chapters will still
            extend recruits a 'bid,' or invitation to join. But students who accept will become full members almost
            immediately. They will be required to complete additional training, including alcohol education. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Insta-Bros.' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Angry student members are deriding those inducted immediately
            into the order as 'insta-bros.' They also question whether the SAE board has authority under its bylaws, as
            Cohen maintains, to impose the ban on local chapters. Their posts warning that brotherly bonds will fade or
            pledging will go underground pack a Facebook page called 'SAE Cause for Change.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Doing
            away with the pledge program is like giving all the kids on a youth soccer team trophies at the end of the
            season for doing 'a good job,'' one critic wrote. 'People need to face adversity in order to feel
            accomplished.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;E-mails and phone messages praising Cohen's move poured in from
            administrators, fraternity members and families affected by hazing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Brave Leader' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We feel like he's a strong, brave leader for taking this organization forward,' said Scott
            Starkey, who called Cohen to applaud the decision. Starkey's son, Carson, died of alcohol poisoning in 2008
            as a freshman during an SAE hazing at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The son of an Olympic athlete, the 6-foot-1-inch Cohen has a square jaw and a commanding presence.
            Owner and chief executive officer of a real estate company based in Newport Beach, California, he has spent
            almost 30 years in volunteer leadership roles at SAE. His brother and nephew belong to the order, and his
            father was an honorary member. Cohen counts his induction into SAE among the most meaningful ceremonies of
            his life, along with his wedding and the naming of his three children. SAE awards cover the walls in his
            study. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tries to live by SAE's 'perfect' creed, the 'True Gentleman,' which all
            members must memorize, he said. It is a kind of golden rule of fraternity life, which begins: 'The true
            gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose
            self-control is equal to all emergencies.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unusual Background &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            many ways, Cohen has an unusual background for an SAE leader. He's the first Jewish president of SAE, which
            used to limit membership to 'members of the Caucasian race' without a parent who was a 'full-blooded Jew,'
            according to a 1903 book of rituals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holding the black volume aloft, Cohen read that
            passage to his audience at the University of La Verne. When SAE renounced racism and anti-Semitism in 1952,
            he reminded the crowd, it faced the same complaints that change would ruin the fraternity that
            traditionalists now make about the pledging ban. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Type 1 diabetic diagnosed at age 11,
            Cohen abhors forced drinking, which is often part of fraternity hazing. He worries that alcohol consumption,
            which can wreak havoc on a diabetic's blood-sugar levels, endangers students with all kinds of health
            issues. Cohen, who wears an insulin pump, serves on the executive board of the University of California at
            Irvine diabetes research center. His son, Devon, also has the disease and held a diabetes fundraiser for his
            bar mitzvah in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;South Africa &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen is also SAE's first
            foreign-born leader, and speaks in the lilting accent of his native South Africa. His late father, Desmond
            Vernon Cohen, was an obstetrician-gynecologist, as well as a swimmer and water polo player on two South
            African Olympic teams. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fearing racial strife over the government's apartheid policy, the
            family left South Africa in the late 1970s when Cohen was 16. When he announced the pledging ban, Cohen
            compared the treatment of new members as 'second-class citizens' to the abuse of blacks under apartheid.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feeling lost and alone as a foreign student at the University of Arizona, Cohen helped
            alumni reopen the SAE chapter there. It had been shut down years before for hazing, including branding
            pledges on their buttocks with 'Phi Alpha,' the SAE salutation and motto, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Leopard
            Print &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Cohen's pledging didn't include physical hazing, he was subjected to
            practical jokes, such as taking a fake national exam, he said. Once initiated, he made lifelong friends. In
            his study, he flips through old photos of himself with his fraternity buddies, including one at a party
            where he is dressed as a Zulu warrior, in a scanty leopard-print outfit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After
            graduating from Arizona with a bachelor's in psychology and business administration in 1985, Cohen worked
            for two years at SAE's headquarters in Evanston, Illinois. As director of expansion, he helped establish
            more than 20 new chapters, including one at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen
            moved to Southern California in 1988. After a stint at Xerox Corp. (XRX), he started working in the title
            insurance business. In 2009, he opened his own company, Granite Escrow Services Inc., which has annual
            revenue of more than $10 million, almost 100 employees and seven offices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hazing
            Tragedies &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By then, Cohen had joined the Supreme Council, SAE's governing board. He was
            also increasingly dismayed by hazing-related tragedies, including Starkey's death after downing beer, rum
            and 151-proof liquor in an initiation ritual. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His wife, Kim, a former singer and actress
            who is also from South Africa, shared his concerns. Devon and their younger son, Zachary, wouldn't have been
            allowed to join certain SAE chapters before pledging was eliminated, she said. 'As a mother, I would have
            been scared to put them in an environment like that.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Cohen rose through SAE's ranks,
            he pushed for a more comprehensive safety program, called 'Minerva's Shield,' which includes rules about
            alcohol and sexual consent, as well as a prohibition on hazing. It was adopted in 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still,
            universities have disciplined more than 100 SAE chapters since 2007, some repeatedly, according to a list
            published on the organization's website as a result of a legal settlement. Colleges suspended or closed at
            least 15 SAE chapters in the past three years. In 2011, a sophomore pre-medical student at Cornell
            University died from alcohol poisoning after being blindfolded by SAE pledges in an initiation ritual. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Supreme Archon &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last June, when Cohen became president -- or officially,
            Eminent Supreme Archon -- he signaled his commitment to significant change by backing a proposal to ban
            alcohol in chapter houses. At the convention in Chicago, it failed to get the two-thirds vote needed to
            pass. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen settled for a symbolic step. The council told chapters to stop using the
            word pledge and refer to recruits simply as 'new members.' The goal was that they would be treated more
            humanely. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen should have continued to focus his fight on alcohol abuse, said Nicholas
            Syrett, an associate professor at the University of Northern Colorado and author of a book about the history
            of fraternities. Ending pledging 'doesn't seem like it will change anything about the binge drinking at
            parties that doesn't have anything to do with pledging,' Syrett said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Insurance Risk
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As deaths and injuries mounted, Lloyd's of London became increasingly concerned about
            the risk of insuring SAE. It threatened to drop coverage because the fraternity poses too great a risk,
            according to Gregory Brandt, a state judge in Iowa, and Steven Churchill, executive director of the American
            Medical Association, both SAE council members. Loss of coverage could shut down SAE, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Lloyd's warning was a turning point that 'changed the way' SAE officials viewed the
            fraternity's 'future viability,' Churchill said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members already pay a base fee of $340
            a year for liability coverage, among the highest rates of any fraternity. The SAE national's deductible is
            $1.5 million a year, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SAE's insurance broker, James R. Favor Co., declined to
            comment, as did Lisa Hunter, a Lloyd's spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Media pressure on SAE also mounted.
            A December Bloomberg News article, which called SAE the 'deadliest fraternity,' revealed previously
            unreported hazing at Salisbury University in Maryland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;German Rock &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During
            an eight-week initiation in 2012, SAE brothers at Salisbury forced pledges to drink until they almost passed
            out and demanded they recite the True Gentleman pledge wearing only their underwear while standing in trash
            cans filled with ice, Bloomberg reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fraternity members confined recruits for as
            long as nine hours in a dark basement without food, water or a bathroom, while blasting the same German rock
            song at ear-splitting volume, according to two former pledges and the findings of the university's
            disciplinary board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Bloomberg article, Cohen asked Dwight 'Duke'
            Marshall, the volunteer alumni adviser for SAE's Salisbury chapter, about what happened in the basement.
            Marshall said brothers had played the music only to prevent pledges from hearing secret SAE rituals taking
            place upstairs, according to Cohen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen fired off an e-mail to Marshall and other
            alumni that likened confining students in the dark, amid deafening German music, to something out of
            Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Taking Offense &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I take offense to
            that as a Jew,' he remembered saying in the e-mail. 'I take offense as a member of SAE.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marshall
            and others downplayed the seriousness of hazing at Salisbury to the national fraternity, Cohen said. On Feb.
            2, SAE suspended the chapter's charter and said brothers will lose membership privileges. The university has
            suspended the chapter through the summer of 2015. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview this week, Marshall
            said he didn't mislead Cohen and found his e-mail offensive. Still, he said he respects Cohen's opinion.
            'He's our leader,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen and the rest of the Supreme Council began considering
            a pledging ban. At a Jan. 19 meeting in Tucson, Arizona, they debated the idea and alternatives such as
            shortening the initiation period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final decision to stop pledging came on a Feb. 3
            conference call. Cohen said the council kept its plan under wraps for fear that hazers would accelerate
            abuse of pledges before the program was eliminated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'How many more new members have to
            die before everyone is willing to change the way we operate?' SAE Executive Director Blaine Ayers said in an
            e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bank's Rebuff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A rebuff from an unexpected quarter
            reaffirmed the council's resolve. SAE's charitable foundation had an investment account with New York-based
            JPMorgan containing about $500,000, which was primarily used to make payments on a loan and occasionally to
            sell stock gifts. The account dated back to the mid-2000's, Cohen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, in
            February, JPMorgan said that it was reconsidering the relationship to avoid tarnishing its reputation,
            according to Todd Buchanan, vice president of the foundation and one of Cohen's predecessors as SAE's
            leader. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It was shocking,' Buchanan said. 'It really spoke to why we needed to make a
            stand. We're better than this.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank, which has said it would pay more than $23
            billion to resolve regulatory and criminal investigations, has cut ties since last year with about 2,000
            clients that could attract scrutiny, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Emily Sackett, a
            JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Terminated Ties &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen
            and Buchanan said they learned March 6 that JPMorgan had decided to quit doing business with SAE's
            foundation. On March 7, the bank sent a letter terminating the relationship. That day, Cohen announced the
            pledging ban. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'As an organization, we have been plagued with too much bad behavior,
            which has resulted in loss of lives, negative press and large lawsuits,' he said in a video address. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A week later, during a student leadership conference at the University of La Verne, Cohen milled
            around with undergraduates from chapters across Southern California. Some admired his purple and gold tie,
            adorned with tiny phoenixes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're like the Phoenix,' Cohen told them. 'We're rising
            from the ashes.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Filing into the arena under a huge American flag, SAE brothers wore
            khakis, blazers and crisp white shirts, and ties in the fraternity's colors. Sorority women in high heels
            acted as hostesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Guiding Light' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The brothers shouted the SAE
            motto, 'Phi Alpha,' before joining in a medley of fraternity songs, filling the arena with rich baritones:
            'And to Phi Alpha with its guiding light, And to the lion who will fight, fight, fight.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For
            half an hour, Cohen made his case that the Supreme Council had no choice but to ban pledging: &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'No parent should ever have to suffer the loss of a child because that child was simply trying to
            join a fraternity -- our beloved fraternity, where we claim to be true gentlemen.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After
            the speech, Alexi Sciutto, who just graduated from California State University at Northridge, buttonholed
            Cohen to offer support. His SAE brothers helped him cope with his mother's death from breast cancer, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'll do whatever needs to be done to keep SAE alive,' he told Cohen. 'And I'll do
            it until I die.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christian Couch, 21, a junior from California State University at Long
            Beach who attended Cohen's speech, said he disagreed with the new policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Easy Out'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It doesn't feel right. You just sign up and you're automatically in,' he said. 'It's
            the easy way out.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the speech, Cohen joined other fraternity staff and volunteers
            in workshops about the revamped program for new members, called 'The True Gentleman Experience.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leaning against a wall in a classroom with 25 SAE members, Cohen said that brothers must still
            learn rituals, including the SAE creed. 'They don't need to learn the True Gentleman standing in a tub of
            ice, half naked,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in Cohen's family room, his 14-year-old son, Devon, said
            he's pleased that SAE eliminated pledging. His parents support his ambition to join the fraternity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The brothers I've met are so cool, so nice, so welcoming,' Devon said. 'They really are true
            gentlemen.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Colombia Set for Respite in JPMorgan Peso Rally: Market Reversal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's peso is poised to snap
            its best monthly rally in two years, trading patterns suggest,
            providing relief to a government that's counting on a weaker
            currency to boost the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The peso's 4.2 percent gain this month, its biggest advance
            since January 2012, pushed the currency through the lower line
            of its 20-day Bollinger band, while the 14-day relative-strength
            index gave an overbought signal for the first time since January
            2013. The currency will be due a correction at about 1,950 per
            dollar, or 0.7 percent stronger than current levels, according
            to Brown Brothers Harriman Co. and Banco de Bogota SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The peso has shot up too fast,' said Andres Munoz, the
            head currency trader in Bogota at Corporacion Financiera
            Colombiana, a unit of the nation's largest banking group.
            'We're starting to see investors buying dollars at these
            levels. Technical levels show a reversal is coming soon.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's currency reached a two-month high of 1,957.07
            per dollar today after a surge that made it this month's best
            performer among 24 emerging-market peers tracked by Bloomberg.
            The peso was supported after JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said March 19
            it could more than double the weighting of the nation's local-currency bonds in two of its key debt indexes.

        <headline>Russia's Donskoy Tabak Said to Work With JPMorgan to Find Buyer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Donskoy Tabak, Russia's largest independent tobacco company, is working with JPMorgan Chase Co.
            (JPM) to help it find a buyer amid a government crackdown on smoking, according to people familiar with the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Privately held Donskoy Tabak may get interest from potential bidders such as
            Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Europe's second-biggest tobacco company, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified because the matter is private. The process may slow or even be halted due to the recent Russian
            conflict with Ukraine, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokespeople for Donskoy, Imperial
            Tobacco and JPMorgan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's second-biggest tobacco market is
            consolidating after the government boosted taxes and restricted both points of sale and smoking in public
            places in a bid to reduce usage. The biggest tobacco wholesaler, Megapolis Distribution BV, sold a 40
            percent stake in December to Philip Morris International Inc. and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donskoy
            Tabak sales climbed 26 percent to 36.2 billion rubles ($1 billion) last year, helped by the tax hike,
            according to the company's website. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were 4.6
            billion rubles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unrest in the region has already led to two other consumer companies
            halting plans to sell shares in Russian businesses to the public. Metro AG last week delayed the initial
            public offering of its Russian Cash Carry unit because market conditions were no longer appropriate. The

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. lender, promoted John Simmons to co-head of middle-market
            banking as Steve Walker plans to retire. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seeks to Become Among Top Three in Cash Equities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is seeking to
            become one of the world's three biggest stock brokers, lifting a
            division that has fallen behind its capital markets, equity
            derivatives and investment banking units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank is trying to boost electronic trading
            and increase commission pools to climb from sixth place in cash-equities trading, said Tim Throsby, global
            head of equities in
            London. JPMorgan is ranked first in investment banking, equities
            origination, fixed income, commodities and currencies, while it
            comes second for derivatives products, according to research
            firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the big themes for the firm is to bring cash
            equities up to that same level,' Throsby said in an interview
            in London. 'There are some very obvious areas where we are
            working to improve, and where we think there is a great
            opportunity. Third or fourth place would be a realistic medium-term ambition, with second or third in the
            long term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender isn't planning to hire more staff to accomplish
            the task, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is betting that investments in electronic
            platforms and hedge-fund services will help it leap over rivals
            in an industry that has suffered from declining volume and
            profitability. The New York-based bank was late in boosting
            those offerings as it focused on advisory and sales, said
            analysts including Derek de Vries at UBS AG. (UBSN) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Ghana Cedi Dropping 20% on Inflation, Reserves</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ghana's cedi, the worst-performing
            African currency in the first quarter, could depreciate another
            20 percent this year as foreign-exchange reserves recede and
            inflation (GHCPALLY) accelerates, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Increased risk of outflows from the 'heavily' foreign-owned local bonds, uncertainty around
            commodity prices and fewer
            signs of a 'real turnaround in the country's fiscal situation'
            add to the cedi's weaker outlook, Giulia Pellegrini, sub-Saharan
            Africa economist at JPMorgan, said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank, which cut Ghana's gross domestic
            product forecast for 2014, said lower growth will affect revenue
            generation and widen the budget deficit to 10 percent of GDP
            against the government's target of 8.5 percent. Inflation
            quickened to 14 percent in February, climbing for a sixth
            consecutive month, as the government stopped utility subsidies
            and the cedi weakened. It climbed from 13.8 percent in January,
            above the central bank's target of 9.5 percent plus or minus 2
            percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bank of Ghana has revised up its inflation forecasts,'
            Pellegrini said. 'It sees inflation staying above the target
            band until 2015, with risks tilted to the upside on the
            weakening cedi and slower-than-planned fiscal consolidation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut the economic growth forecast to 5.2 percent
            given the West African nation's erratic power supply and
            uncertainty around commodity prices, Pellegrini said. The
            government's GDP estimate for this year is 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ghana's gross foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $5.3
            billion in January from $5.6 billion the previous month, the
            central bank said March 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currency of the world's second-biggest cocoa producer
            slumped 20 percent against the dollar last year. It is 12
            percent weaker in the first quarter, the most among 24 African
            currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The cedi slipped 0.1 percent
            to 2.6925 per dollar by 4:40 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
            declining for a second day. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) are among about 20 banks and their
            affiliates that must face an investor lawsuit accusing them of
            manipulating benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan said in a
            decision yesterday that the investor, who alleges losses from
            short positions on euroyen Tibor futures contracts, can proceed
            against all the banks with his claim under the Commodity
            Exchange Act for price manipulation and aiding and abetting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investor, Jeffrey Laydon, who seeks to represent other
            investors in a group lawsuit, or class action, said in an
            amended complaint last year that the banks conspired to fix the
            euroyen Tokyo interbank offered rate and the London interbank
            offered rate for the yen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have been probing whether firms
            colluded to manipulate interest-rate benchmarks including Libor,
            which affects more than $300 trillion of securities worldwide.
            Financial institutions have paid about $6 billion so far to
            resolve criminal and civil claims in the U.S. and Europe that
            they manipulated benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The probes have have led to fines and settlements for
            lenders including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays
            Plc (BARC), UBS AG (UBSN) and Rabobank Groep. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Wins Dismissal of Employees' Whale Pension Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) won dismissal
            of a lawsuit filed on behalf of current and former employees
            over losses in their retirement accounts allegedly stemming from
            the $6.2 billion 'London Whale' trading debacle. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels in Manhattan today
            dismissed the suit by participants in the retirement plan who
            lost money on company stock after the bank reported a $2 billion
            trading loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The employees said the bank made misstatements about its
            financial health from January to April 2012, allowing its stock
            to trade at inflated prices. They claim they lost money when
            JPMorgan disclosed its losses publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trading losses came on synthetic credit products, which
            are derivatives tied to credit performance. In disclosing the $2
            billion loss on transactions he said were intended to manage
            risk, JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            cited 'egregious' failures by the bank's chief investment
            office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniels is overseeing lawsuits against New York-based
            JPMorgan tied to trading losses allegedly caused by its chief
            investment office and Bruno Iksil, known as the 'London Whale'
            because of the size of his bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In Re JPMorgan Chase Co. Erisa Litigation,
            12-cv-04027, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York

        <headline>Generac's $1.15 Billion Dividend Loan Said to Be Led by JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Generac Holdings Inc. (GNRC)'s $1.15 billion
            term loan supporting a dividend and refinancing is being led by
            JPMorgan Chase Co., which will host a lender meeting tomorrow,
            according to a person with knowledge of the transaction who
            asked not to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The generator maker is paying a dividend of as much as $5 a
            share, the company said today in a regulatory filing. The new
            financing will include a $150 million asset-based revolving
            credit line that will be undrawn at closing, Generac said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Generac, based in Waukesha, Wisconsin, will incur about
            $335 million in debt from the payout, according to the filing.
            It has about $801 million outstanding under a term loan due in
            May 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt,
            obtained last year, began paying interest at 5 percentage points
            more than the London interbank offered rate with a 1.25 percent
            minimum on the lending benchmark, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a revolving line of credit, money may be borrowed again
            once it's repaid; in a term loan it can't. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lazard Ltd. (LAZ), the largest independent
            merger-advisory firm, hired Larry Slaughter as a managing
            director and vice chairman in its investment-banking business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slaughter, 49, was previously co-head of North American
            investment banking at New York-based JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the
            biggest U.S. lender, and also served as head of European
            investment banking corporates in London, Lazard said today in a
            statement. He spent 26 years at the bank and focuses on
            transactions in industrials and automotives, the advisory firm
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lazard has targeted at least $125 million in expense
            reductions, giving the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company
            flexibility to hire senior employees, Chief Executive Officer
            Ken Jacobs, 54, told investors last week on a conference call.
            Slaughter resigned from JPMorgan as part of a long-standing plan
            to do something new with his career, the Financial Times
            reported in February, citing an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have known and respected Larry for many years,'
            Antonio Weiss, Lazard's global head of investment banking, said
            in the statement. 'His industry knowledge, sound judgment and

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees 20% Drop in Second-Quarter Markets Revenue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank by revenue, said Wall Street's trading
            slump has deepened and could last through the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will drop about
            20 percent from a year earlier at the New York-based company
            amid 'a continued challenging environment and lower client
            activity levels,' JPMorgan said yesterday in its quarterly
            regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
            of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
            was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
            Continued weakness has spurred analysts including Chris Mutascio
            of Stifel Financial Corp.'s KBW unit to ponder whether the drop
            in fixed-income trading might persist through 2014 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's an industry phenomenon, and other banks allow
            JPMorgan to grease the skids for them so there can be a gentle
            letdown process,' said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
            Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 20 percent revenue slide from the $5.37 billion JPMorgan
            posted in last year's second quarter would mean results of $4.3
            billion this period. That figure, along with the first quarter's
            $5.06 billion, would mark the bank's worst first half in trading
            since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mercuria Said to Offer Jobs to JPMorgan Traders</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., which agreed to buy JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s physical commodity unit
            for $3.5 billion in March, is offering jobs to about 200 people, or half the unit's staff, according to a
            person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercuria, whose main trading floor is in Geneva, began
            making offers to traders and executives in the JPMorgan commodities unit late last week, said the person,
            who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Those who aren't offered jobs will either
            stay with JPMorgan or be fired, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investment banks including JPMorgan,
            Barclays Plc (BARC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are withdrawing from or scaling back physical commodity
            operations as revenue falls and regulators place increased scrutiny on lenders owning and storing raw
            materials. Trading houses such as Mercuria, which has in less than a decade grown to become the world's
            fourth-largest independent commodity trader with 2013 revenue of $112 billion, are filling the void. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Burton declined to comment as did Mercuria spokesman Benoit Lioud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria is most interested in JPMorgan's physical gas and power traders in Europe and the U.S. as
            well as gas and crude trading operations in Canada, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, the
            head of the bank's global commodities operations, will leave once the sale is completed, JPMorgan has said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Henry Bath &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercuria hasn't decided how many of the more than 100
            employees at JPMorgan's Henry Bath Sons Ltd. metals warehousing unit will be asked to join the new company,
            the person said. The 220-year-old Liverpool-based firm handles and stores aluminum, copper and other metals
            and was a founding member of the London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From 2011 to 2013, Mercuria
            hired 570 people, including executives from banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays. That
            boosted staff to 1,200 from about 10 in 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan unit will give Mercuria gas
            and power trading operations on both sides of the Atlantic, physical assets spanning 40 locations in North
            America, an oil-trading book with a supply and off-take contract at the largest refinery on the U.S. East
            Coast, and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian oil sands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;European Gas
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercuria's head of compliance Victoria Attwood Scott said last month that the trading
            house is in discussions with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority to determine whether the purchase of
            JPMorgan's European gas and power business means Mercuria should be subject to regulatory oversight. Unlike
            banks, the FCA does not have regulatory authority over trading houses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue for the
            10 largest investment-bank commodity operations slumped to $4.5 billion last year from about $14 billion in
            2008, according to the London-based analytics company Coalition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barclays said last week
            that it's exiting most commodities markets apart from precious metals, oil and gas derivatives and index
            products. Barclays cut jobs in January in fixed income, currencies and commodities and shut power-trading
            desks in the U.S. and Europe in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's largest bank, said
            in December it would get out of dedicated energy, agriculture, dry-bulk and industrial-metals trading,
            cutting about 200 jobs. Bank of America Corp. said in January it would dispose of its European power and gas
            inventory as increasing regulation curbs trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley agreed to sell its
            oil-merchant business to OAO Rosneft (ROSN), Russia's state-run producer, in December. The sale hasn't been
            submitted for regulatory approval and the companies will probably wait until tensions cool after the U.S.
            sanctioned Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, a person with knowledge of the situation said on
            April 29. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan, UBS May Try Mediator in $2 Billion Mortgage Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A judge handling a $2 billion lawsuit
            against banks including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) brought
            by the former Thornburg Mortgage invited their lawyers to file
            statements on the possible appointment of a mediator to resolve
            the dispute, according to a federal court filing in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge, after holding a hearing on the banks' requests
            for dismissal of the suit, gave no deadline for the 'brief
            statements' about a mediator although he said 'quickly
            advised' in a handwritten note filed in court May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trustee for what is now TMST Inc. accused the banks,
            including Credit Suisse Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc,
            of extracting more than $700 million of margin and interest
            payments from the former Thornburg by making 'unjustified'
            margin calls, speeding its failure. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Energy Traders May Face FERC Case, N.Y. Times Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was warned by
            U.S. energy-market authorities that they may take action against
            its employees as part of an inquiry into bidding practices, the
            New York Times said, citing a document it reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enforcement officials at the Federal Energy Regulatory
            Commission plan to recommend the agency hold traders and
            commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters 'individually liable,'
            the newspaper reported, citing a 70-page document the agency
            sent the New York-based bank in March. Investigators said
            Masters falsely denied awareness of problems, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case focuses on eight 'schemes' adopted by traders in
            Houston between September 2010 and June 2011, according to the
            newspaper. The traders offered energy at prices 'calculated to
            falsely appear attractive,' prompting state authorities in
            California and Michigan to make about $83 million in
            'excessive' payments to JPMorgan, the Times cited
            investigators as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The staff is challenging a bidding strategy that was
            transparent and was in full compliance with the applicable
            rules,' the Times quoted Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the
            bank, as saying. 'We strongly disagree with the staff's
            conclusions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Strongly Dispute' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan intends to defend itself and the employees, she
            told the newspaper. 'We strongly dispute that Blythe Masters or
            any employee lied or acted inappropriately in this matter.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Buffett Supports Dimon's Dual Roles 100% at JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who has said he personally owns shares of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), is backing the
            bank's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon as shareholders vote this month on whether to split
            his roles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm 100 percent for Jamie,' Buffett told Bloomberg Television's Betty Liu
            yesterday in Omaha, Nebraska. 'I couldn't think of a better chairman.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon,
            57, to relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since New York-based JPMorgan disclosed risk-control lapses
            on derivatives bets last year that fueled more than $6.2 billion of losses. In March, the company's board
            urged investors to vote against naming a separate chairman at the May 21 meeting, saying that Dimon's dual
            role remains the 'most effective leadership model.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett said in November that Dimon
            would be the best candidate to lead the U.S. Treasury Department in a financial crisis. President Barack
            Obama eventually nominated Jacob J. Lew to the post vacated by Timothy F. Geithner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors
            would risk shortening Dimon's tenure if they appoint a separate chairman and their company's stock may lose
            its 'premium valuation,' Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said last month in a note to
            clients. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>ADCB Raised at JPMorgan on Cutting Low-Quality Assets Exposure</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, (ADCB) the
            third-biggest lender by assets in the United Arab Emirates, was
            raised to overweight at JPMorgan Chase Co. after it cut
            exposure to low quality assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'ADCB management has commendably turned around the
            franchise over the last two-three years by cleaning up the asset
            book, prudently managing liquidity while conserving spreads
            better versus regional peers and strengthening the capital base
            by disposal of non-core assets,' analysts including Naresh Bilandani wrote in a research report. This has
            made 'the
            business model much simpler -' simplicity receives a plus from
            bank investors in the current regulatory scenario.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ADCB said last week it settled lawsuits against Morgan
            Stanley, Standard Poor's, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and
            others over its purchase of Cheyne SIV notes. The bank reported
            a 4 percent increase in first-quarter profit to 830 million
            dirhams ($226 million), beating analysts' estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan raised the recommendation from neutral and
            increased the price estimate to 5.50 dirhams from 5 dirhams. The
            stock closed at 4.61 dirhams last week. It has surged 55 percent
            this year, outpacing the 30 percent climb for Abu Dhabi's ADX
            Banks Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also raised the price estimate of First Gulf Bank, (FGB)
            its top pick among banks in the Middle East and North Africa, to
            18 dirhams from 13.50 dirhams. The overweight recommendation was
            maintained. The stock has risen 25 percent this year to 14.55
            dirhams last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Bank of Abu Dhabi, the U.A.E.'s biggest bank by
            assets, was cut to neutral from overweight at JPMorgan, saying
            the shares are 'trading close to their June 2014 fair value and
            the relative valuation of NBAD looking stretched versus peer
            regional names.' The stock gained 31 percent this year to 12.25
            dirhams last week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s proposal to pay
            $280 million to investors who claimed they were misled in buying
            mortgage-backed securities won preliminary approval from a
            federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Pamela K. Chen issued the order May 2
            granting initial approval to the settlement with investors led
            by the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi. A
            hearing on final approval is scheduled for July 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mississippi pension plan sued in March 2008 on behalf
            of investors who bought $36.8 billion of mortgage-backed
            securities from May 2006 to September 2007, claiming the bank
            misrepresented the offerings for the investments. JPMorgan
            didn't admit to any wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the
            lawsuit, according to the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian J. Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
            comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Plumbers Pipefitters' Local No. 562

        <headline>JPMorgan Shares Drop After Forecast for 20% Trading Slump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank by revenue, dropped the most in almost a
            month after warning that a deepening Wall Street trading slump
            may last through the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the company tumbled as much as 3.4 percent to
            $53.70 before paring the loss to $54.05 at 9:39 a.m. The slide,
            which brought the year-to-date decline to 7.3 percent, was the
            biggest in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. Citigroup Inc. lost
            1.5 percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) fell 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will fall about
            20 percent from last year's second quarter, New York-based
            JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing after the market closed
            last week. The firm blamed 'a continued challenging environment
            and lower client activity levels.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
            of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
            was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
            A 20 percent slide from the $5.37 billion posted in last year's
            second quarter would mean about $4.3 billion from the trading
            business this period. That would mark the company's worst first
            half in trading since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The division's actual results will hinge on its performance
            during remaining months in the quarter, which 'can be
            volatile,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts have cited the Federal Reserve's decision to slow
            its bond-purchasing program for some of the decline, which
            eroded first-quarter results at U.S. financial firms including
            Bank of America and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Citigroup, Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect that the weakness JPM is experiencing in
            trading-related revenues will be duplicated at other capital-markets-oriented banks,' Charles Peabody, an
            analyst at
            Portales Partners LLC, said today in a research note, referring
            to the bank by its stock symbol. He singled out Citigroup and
            Goldman Sachs as most likely to report weak trading results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which is concentrated more on equities than
            bonds, was alone in registering a trading increase during the
            first three months of 2014, though Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, 56, said she saw weakness ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The volumes that we talked a lot about during the first
            quarter -- lower activity -- we're continuing to see that really
            does persist into the second quarter,' Porat said in a
            Bloomberg Television interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan gave forecasts on other business units. Mortgage
            banking will post a pretax production loss of $100 million to
            $150 million in the second quarter, driven by higher interest
            rates, the bank said. Expenses will be lower than the $59
            billion reported last year, according to the forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First-quarter profit fell 19 percent to $5.27 billion,
            driven by a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income trading, JPMorgan
            said April 11. &lt;/p&gt;

            500 Financials Index. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
            Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) all lost at least 1.3

        <headline>JPMorgan at Odds With IMF in Touting Emerging-Market Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S.
            bank by assets, sees no signs of a bubble in emerging-market
            corporate debt, challenging the International Monetary Fund's
            warning on rising risks in the bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by developing-country companies account for just
            3 percent of gross domestic product in these economies, compared
            with 35 percent in the U.S., according to Joyce Chang, global
            head of research at the New York-based bank. Most of the lenders
            selling debt are rated investment grade or backed by their
            governments while maturities have been extended, she said in a
            May 2 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IMF warned last month that some emerging-market
            companies are vulnerable to capital flight if global borrowing
            costs rise further as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws
            its expansionary monetary polices. Corporate debt for developing
            countries tracked by Bank of America Corp. surged to $1.1
            trillion from $411 billion at the end of 2009 as companies took
            advantage of low interest rates to raise cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would really'challenge some of the views from'official
            creditors that emerging-market corporate debt is'the next asset
            bubble,' Chang, who was promoted from head of fixed-income
            research last month amid a leadership reshuffle in the global
            banking division, said in New York. 'The'credit'quality of
            emerging-market'issuance'has been pretty'good.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Olga Stankova, a spokeswoman for the IMF, didn't respond to
            a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Crisis Catalyst &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growth of emerging-market bonds is mostly driven by supply-demand imbalances rather than
            speculation, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rise of developing-country debt has happened after the
            supply of fixed-income products from mature markets shrank
            following the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Chang. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time, banks, pension funds and insurance
            companies are required to hold more bonds in their investment
            portfolio as part of tighter financial regulation, boosting the
            demand for emerging-market securities, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have a structural shift in the market with a supply
            and demand imbalance and emerging markets'have benefited from
            the lack of alternative investment opportunities,' Chang said.
            'The'increase in issuance is obviously something to flag, but
            then you have to look at whether'the issuance is'short-term debt
            for refinancing.'EM issuance is the longest duration within
            fixed income and EM is not facing a wall of maturities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IMF said on April 9 in a report that corporate bonds of
            developing nations are vulnerable in an environment of rising
            global interest rates and slower growth prospects. About $740
            billion, or 35 percent of emerging-market outstanding debt, may
            be at risk of default in a scenario involving a 25 percent
            increase in borrowing costs and a 25 percent drop in corporate
            earnings, according to the Washington-based fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Corporate EMBI Broad Diversified Index returned
            3.8 percent this year through May 2. The gauge lost 0.6 percent
            last year, the first annual decline since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Commerzbank Pondering Turkey Bond Yield Bottom</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks from JPMorgan Chase Co. to
            Morgan Stanley and Commerzbank AG are weighing the outlook for
            Turkey's two-year note yield after it fell below 5 percent for
            the first time amid fading inflation concern. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two-year yields will drop to 4 percent, according to Tatha Ghose at Commerzbank, Germany's
            second-biggest lender. Morgan
            Stanley says the current low rate isn't justified, while Turk
            Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) predicts yields won't fall further. The yield
            sank to as low as 4.96 percent on May 3 before rising to 5.14
            percent, trimming the drop in the past year to 419 basis points,
            the most among 17 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg and more
            than twice the slide for Polish notes, the next largest decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turkish inflation slowed more than economists estimated to
            a two-year low in April, giving the central bank room to reduce
            interest rates. Even with the drop in yields, Turkey still
            offers the fifth-highest rate in emerging markets as policy
            makers globally rely on stimulus measures to revive growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We may test towards 4.5 percent,' Yarkin Cebeci, an
            economist at JPMorgan in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments on
            May 3. 'Sounds unbelievable, but this is the reality. Given
            ample global liquidity, a strong domestic story, low
            inflationary pressures and a dovish central bank, bond yields
            could fall further.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Negative Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Swiss, Germany and Finnish two-year yields trade near zero
            while Australia's 2.51 percent rate is the highest among 22
            developed countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at
            the end of last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India cut interest rates for a third straight meeting on
            May 3, a day after the European Central Bank lowered its main
            rate to a record 0.5 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi said
            last week that policy makers had an 'open mind' on reducing
            their so-called deposit rate below the current level of zero for
            the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lira weakened for a fourth day, sliding 0.1 percent to
            1.7956 per dollar at 11:15 a.m. in Istanbul today. The currency
            has depreciated 0.7 percent this year. The two-year note yield
            fell three basis points to 5.11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moody's Investors Service rekindled expectations of a
            rating upgrade on April 11 when it praised Turkey's peace talks
            with the Kurdistan Workers' Party in an effort to end a conflict
            that began in 1984. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Upgrade Story' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Turkey has a rating upgrade story and funds in the system
            are also cheap and abundant,' said Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist
            at HSBC Asset Management in Istanbul. 'If this euphoria
            continues, we can see the benchmark bond yields reach 4.8-4.9
            percent.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings lifted Turkey to investment-grade status in
            November, the economy's first such ranking in 18 years. Moody's
            and Standard Poor's rate Turkey one level below investment
            grade. Investors who borrowed in U.S. dollars and bought Turkish
            lira debt earned 5.4 percent over the past year, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turkey's economy grew 2.2 percent last year, the slowest
            pace since a recession in 2009, and down from 8.8 percent in
            2011. The economy needs to grow at least 6 percent a year to
            meet its goal of becoming one of the world's top 10 economies by
            the 2023 centennial of the Turkish Republic, Economy Minister
            Zafer Caglayan said April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Turkey's dollar
            bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries fell one basis point, or 0.01
            percentage point, to 185 today, compared with an average 269
            basis points for emerging markets, JPMorgan's EMBI Global
            Diversified index showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Logic &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think there is a clear logic behind yields
            anywhere in emerging markets these days,' Tevfik Aksoy, chief
            economist for emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa at
            Morgan Stanley in London, said in e-mailed comments on May 3.
            'As long as investors get a tiny amount of carry, they will
            pile in.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turkey's central bank reduced all three of its main
            interest rates last month, citing an increase of capital
            inflows. The Monetary Policy Committee is next scheduled to meet
            May 16. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on Turkey's two-year notes may fall to 4 percent and
            then stay there through year-end, while rates on longer-maturity
            debt rise, according to Ghose, Commerzbank's senior emerging-
            market economist in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inflation and overheating worries are disappearing around
            the world and won't be back for three years, Ghose wrote in e-
            mailed comments. 'I would be much more bullish for two-year
            bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names 2 Replacements for Masters at Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named two
            managing directors, John Anderson and Mike Camacho, to take over
            from Blythe Masters as co-heads of global commodities after the
            bank pulls back from physical products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anderson has been JPMorgan's Houston-based head of non-oil
            energy trading and Camacho has led EMEA commodities in London
            since 2012, the New York-based company said in a memo to
            employees today. Masters, who started as an intern almost three
            decades ago, plans to leave as JPMorgan completes a $3.5 billion
            sale of the physical commodities business to Mercuria Energy
            Group Ltd., according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are confident our franchise will continue to be
            recognized for our commitment to clients, and our dedication to
            providing them with the products they need across a wide range
            of commodities products and services,' according to the memo
            from James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, co-heads of global rates,
            foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, is getting out of physical
            commodities amid pressure from regulators and lawmakers. They're
            concerned that banks handling raw materials and energy could
            manipulate prices or endanger the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The replacements for Masters were reported earlier by
            SparkSpread, an industry trade publication. JPMorgan fell 1.6
            percent to $53.34 today in New York, leaving the shares down 8.8
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Investment Banker Warmstein Said to Retire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Eric Warmstein, a managing director in
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s financial-institutions advisory business,
            has retired, a person familiar with the move said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warmstein, 56, left last week after seven years with New
            York-based JPMorgan, the person said, asking not to be
            identified because the move hasn't been announced. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the bank, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warmstein tied for the No. 1 ranking among bankers advising
            on bank and thrift deals last year, according to SNL Financial,
            a bank research firm in Charlottesville, Virginia. He helped
            advise Umpqua Holdings Corp. in its $2 billion purchase of
            Sterling Financial Corp., SNL data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warmstein joined JPMorgan in 2007 from UBS AG, where he
            worked on transactions such Bank of New York Co.'s purchase of
            Mellon Financial Corp., and Bank of America Corp.'s purchase of
            U.S. Trust Corp., according to a memo at the time. His
            colleagues at Zurich-based UBS included Kenneth Moelis, who
            later founded advisory Moelis Co., and Olivier Sarkozy, now at
            Carlyle Group LP. Before that Warmstein was a merger adviser at
            Credit Suisse First Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's financial-institutions group, led by Fernando Rivas, ranked No. 1 in handling U.S. bank
            deals last year,
            advising on seven transactions worth $5.8 billion, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. That was good for about 47 percent
            of the announced deal volume. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon sees challenges from companies such as
            Facebook Inc. (FB) and Google Inc. (GOOGL) as they seek to provide online
            banking and money-sending services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We move $10 trillion a day,' Dimon said today at the
            Euromoney Saudi Arabia conference in Riyadh. 'We're one of the
            largest payments systems in the world. We're going to have
            competition from Google and Facebook and somebody else.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies are competing for a share of the global
            electronic-payments market worth as much as $1.8 trillion a
            year, according to Capgemini's 2013 World Payments report.
            Google created Wallet, a system using smartphones, and Facebook
            is seeking regulatory approval in Ireland for a service to allow
            users to store money on the site, the Financial Times reported
            last month without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 58, said regulators must decide whether they should
            oversee such companies providing financial services. 'There's
            no way that Google wants to be a regulated bank,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., (AAPL) which has more than 400 million credit cards on
            file at its iTunes Store, is exploring an expansion of the
            mobile-payments system, a person with knowledge of the matter
            said in January. PayPal, the online payments system owned by
            EBay Inc. (EBAY), contributes almost 40 percent of the San Jose-based
            e-commerce company's revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, should oust most of its board and split Jamie
            Dimon's dual roles as chairman and chief executive officer, shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis Co. said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stockholders should replace six of the board's 11 directors at the bank's annual meeting
            May 21 and approve a proposal to name an independent chairman, Glass Lewis said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Calls for Dimon, 57, to relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when New
            York-based JPMorgan disclosed risk-control lapses in its chief investment office on credit-derivative bets
            that fueled a $6.2 billion trading loss and sparked regulatory probes. Institutional Shareholder Services on
            May 3 also urged a vote in favor of splitting Dimon's roles and removing three directors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigations
            by the company and lawmakers 'have revealed questionable risk-management practices at both the senior
            management and board levels,' Glass Lewis wrote in the report. 'Shareholders should be concerned that
            company management was allowed to build a massive exposure to credit derivatives,' switch risk models and
            undervalue its losses without triggering a review by the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glass Lewis said
            shareholders should vote against James A. Bell, former chief financial officer at Boeing Co.; Crandall C.
            Bowles, chairman of Springs Industries Inc.; David M. Cote, CEO of Honeywell International Inc. (HON); James
            S. Crown, president of Henry Crown Co.; Ellen V. Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural
            History; and Laban P. Jackson, CEO of Clear Creek Properties Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

            bank, told about 10 traders in its commodity business that their
            jobs may be eliminated, according to two people with knowledge
            of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank may dismiss or relocate seven in London and one in
            Dubai, said the people, asking not to be identified because the
            matter is private. A second Dubai-based trader will be relocated
            to London, the people said. Patrick Burton, a spokesman for the
            bank in the U.K. capital, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had the second-biggest revenue from commodities
            after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last year, analytics company
            Coalition said in March. New York-based JPMorgan has commodity
            bankers based in 12 countries, according to its website, though
            it doesn't disclose how many commodity traders it has globally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities revenue at the 10 largest banks slumped 24
            percent last year to $6 billion amid low volatility and reduced
            client activity, according to a Feb. 15 Coalition report.
            Increasing concerns about regulation and capital sensitivity
            also led banks to re-examine commodity strategies, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Low Volatility &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Spot Index of raw materials
            climbed less than 0.3 percent in 2012, the worst performance in
            four years. The gauge's 100-day historic volatility fell to as
            low as 14.1 percent in May, from as much as 23.8 percent in
            January 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said in February it will eliminate as many as
            19,000 jobs in mortgages and community banking through 2014 as
            it trims expenses. This year, the bank's headcount will shrink
            by about 4,000 people, mainly through attrition, while some
            employees are redeployed to other areas, said Kristin Lemkau, a
            spokeswoman, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's first-quarter profit rose 33 percent to a record
            last month as the bank shrank expenses by 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Agree to Acquire Tower for $650 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset-
            management unit agreed to buy the 31-story tower at 425
            Lexington Ave. in midtown Manhattan for about $650 million, a
            person with knowledge of the plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A contract to acquire the 750,000-square-foot (70,000-
            square-meter) building is likely to be completed soon, said the
            person, who asked not to be identified because the talks are
            private. It's one of two Manhattan towers being marketed by
            Houston-based developer Hines, along with 499 Park Ave.,
            designed by I.M. Pei. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York commercial-property transactions are forecast to
            climb this year as investors globally see Manhattan as a safe
            place to buy real estate. Brokerage Cushman Wakefield last
            month projected sales of $14.6 billion for the first half of
            2013, up from $10.8 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alyson Leiter, a Hines spokeswoman, said the company had no
            comment on the planned sale of 425 Lexington. Douglas Harmon,
            senior managing director at Eastdil Secured, who's marketing the
            building, and Darin Oduyoye, a spokesman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Law firm Simpson Thacher Bartlett LLP, the tower's
            primary tenant, with 595,000 square feet on 26 floors, renewed
            its lease through 2033, Hines said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hines bought the glass tower, completed in 1987, for $346
            million in 2003, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
            York-based property-research firm. The building is on the east
            side of Lexington between East 43rd and 44th streets, just north
            of the Chrysler Building. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan agreement was reported by Crain's New York
            Business on its website earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley Joins JPMorgan in Raising '14 CLO Forecast</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Concern that regulatory scrutiny will
            curb the market for collateralized loan obligations may have
            been overblown. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for new CLOs in the U.S.
            this year to as much as $85 billion, at least the third bank
            since April to boost projections for the biggest buyers of junk
            loans. JPMorgan Chase Co. boosted its projection to as much as
            $100 billion on May 2, while Wells Fargo (WFC) Co. lifted it to as
            high as $90 billion last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CLO issuance is accelerating after concern regulatory
            attention would damp new formation of the funds, which provide
            financing to speculative-grade companies. The Volcker Rule,
            adopted in December as part of the financial overhaul mandated
            by the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from investing in a CLO
            that owns bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The new issue market has shrugged off this year's slow
            start, as well as the potential regulatory headwinds from the
            Volcker rule,' Morgan Stanley analysts Vishwanath Tirupattur
            and Mia Qian wrote in a research note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A total $12.3 billion of broadly syndicated U.S. CLOs were
            formed last month, the highest monthly volume since the
            financial crisis, bringing total issuance this year through
            April to $31.7 billion as the investor base expanded, according
            to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo raised its forecast to what would potentially
            be the most in seven years, according to an April 1 research
            note. JPMorgan increased its projections to $90 billion to $100
            billion from $60 billion to $70 billion, according to a May 2
            research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Resurging Issuance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) revised its forecast to $75 billion to $85
            billion of CLOs, from previous projections for $55 billion to
            $65 billion, according to the research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of CLOs collapsed to $20.6 billion in 2008, the
            year Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed, from a record $104.7
            billion in 2007, according to Wells Fargo. Last year's issuance
            totaled $82.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CLOs were the biggest buyers of new high-yield loans last
            quarter, with about 55 percent of the primary market, according
            to Standard Poor's Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary Data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies have raised $223 billion of U.S. loans this year
            from institutional investors such as CLOs and mutual funds,
            after a record $686 billion in 2013, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Junk loans are rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors
            Service and below BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices of the debt have climbed this week to 98.47 cents on
            the dollar yesterday, the highest level since February,
            according to the SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Corfield Rides 46% Return With BMG Bond Call</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;If you've followed analyst Natalia Corfield during her stints at two of Wall Street's biggest
            banks, you know one call has been constant: her recommendation
            to buy Banco BMG SA's bonds. You also know that she's been
            right. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corfield, now at JPMorgan Chase Co., began recommending
            the notes in July 2012 when she was at Deutsche Bank AG. In that
            span, BMG's $250 million of bonds due in 2020 have returned 46
            percent -- more than four times the average gain for emerging-market corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BMG's decision to form a joint venture with Itau Unibanco
            Holding SA, Latin America's biggest bank, 22 months ago has
            propelled its $1.1 billion of notes and prompted Corfield to
            stick with her view. The bank, based in the Brazilian Corfield's
            home state of Minas Gerais before moving to Sao Paulo this year,
            said April 29 it will boost its stake in the venture to 40
            percent from 30 percent, adding to bond gains. The unit has
            allowed BMG to obtain cheaper funding and stem losses after
            Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA's collapse dried up funding for midsize
            banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everyone was afraid because of what happened to Cruzeiro,
            but I knew BMG,' Corfield, who reiterated a buy on the BMG
            notes after the April 29 announcement, said by phone from New
            York. 'It's a very good story. The cost of funding surged after
            Cruzeiro, and it decreased with the joint venture, and it will
            likely drop more now.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Drastically' Reduced &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on BMG's bonds soared to a record 18.51 percent in
            June 2012 after Cruzeiro defaulted on $1.6 billion of notes and
            was seized by Brazilian regulators. A month later, BMG announced
            the joint venture with Itau, which agreed to provide as much as
            300 million reais ($134.6 million) per month for five years to
            finance BMG's payroll loans. The 2020 securities now yield 7.94
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal has 'drastically' reduced BMG's funding costs as
            the market prices in improvements in the bank's performance and
            margins, according to investor relations manager Danilo
            Herculano Andrade Silva. BMG's increased stake in the venture
            will be reflected in the bank's fourth-quarter earnings, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender's net income totaled 428.5 million reais last
            year, reversing a loss of 580 million reais in 2012. Net
            interest margin reached 9.3 percent in 2013, 5.1 percentage
            points higher than the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The joint venture is exceeding all our estimates,' BMG's
            Silva said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. 'The
            performance of the bonds shows that investors see the deal was a
            success. I think we'll still see an improvement in the market's
            perception of BMG.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Huge Success' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has no plans to buy back bonds and is unlikely to
            increase the stake in the venture further, Silva said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marcelo Kopel, Itau's head of investor relations, said on a
            conference call with reporters April 29 that he expects Banco
            Itau BMG Consignado's loan portfolio to reach 20 billion reais
            by the end of this year from about 12 billion reais now. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An Itau official who asked not to be named in accordance
            with company policy declined to comment further on the venture
            or on BMG's bond performance when contacted by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The partnership has been a huge success, with the obvious
            benefit being the decreased cost of funding,' Jim Harper, the
            head of research at BCP Securities LLC in Greenwich,
            Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. 'The BMG bonds will
            react favorably to anything that represents a move towards
            integration.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Yield Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carlos Gribel, vice president for emerging markets at INTL
            FCStone Securities, said that while BMG's notes may continue to
            climb as the partnership grows, they will still trade at a
            premium to Itau's bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau's $1 billion of subordinated debt due in 2020 yields
            4.38 percent, or 3.56 percentage points less than BMG's notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BMG's curve has climbed a lot, but the yield will not
            reach Itau's,' Gribel said in a telephone interview from Miami.
            'It will be somewhere between mid-sized banks and Itau, because
            at the end of the day, Itau doesn't guarantee the bonds. There's
            an extra risk, and there's a premium for that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BMG's 2020 bonds have gained 5.8 cents to 104.5 cents on
            the dollar, the highest since 2011, since the bank said it will
            boost its stake in the joint venture, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. While the rally will continue, further gains will
            be more 'gradual,' Corfield said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This will free up capital and decrease their funding
            costs even more,' she said. 'Bondholders are seeing the
            venture is working well.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) won dismissal of
            MBIA Inc. (MBI)'s lawsuit over a $1.16 billion pool of mortgages it
            agreed to insure, with the judge saying the bond insurer can
            revise and refile the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There was no evidence MBIA relied on an allegedly altered
            due diligence report for the mortgages that was provided by Bear
            Stearns as an underwriter, said New York Supreme Court Justice
            Alan Scheinkman in White Plains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is one of many still pending against banks over
            alleged misrepresentations in the packaging and sale of
            mortgage-backed securities that helped bring on the 2008
            financial crisis. JPMorgan, which acquired Bear Stearns in 2008,
            agreed in November to pay $13 billion to settle Justice
            Department allegations it defrauded investors in the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Werder, a lawyer for MBIA, didn't immediately
            respond to an e-mail after regular business hours today seeking
            comment on yesterday's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. J.P. Morgan Securities
            LLC, 64676/2012, Supreme Court of New York, County of
            Westchester (White Plains). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was among
            borrowers including State Street Corp. and Statoil ASA (STL) selling
            at least $15.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank issued $2 billion of 1.625 percent,
            five-year notes at narrower relative yields than those on
            similar-maturity debt sold four months ago, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. A spread of 92 basis points more than
            similar-maturity Treasuries compares with an extra yield of 103
            basis points for $1.25 billion of 1.8 percent, five-year
            debentures that New York-based JPMorgan sold Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Statoil, the largest Norwegian energy company, sold $3
            billion of debt in a four-part offering that included $900
            million of 2.65 percent bonds due 2024 that pay 90 basis points
            more than Treasuries, $850 million of 30-year, 3.95 percent debt
            with an extra yield of 95 basis points, $750 million of 1.15
            percent notes maturing 2018 that pay 45 more than benchmarks and
            $500 million of similar-maturity, floating-rate bonds that yield
            29 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;State Street, the third-largest custody bank, sold $1
            billion of 3.1 percent, 10-year bonds that yield 135 basis
            points more than Treasuries and $500 million of 1.35 percent
            debt due 2018 with a spread of 62.5, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other issuers today included Warren Buffett's Berkshire
            Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A), HSBC Holdings Plc and Brinker International Inc. (EAT),
            the owner of the Chili's and Maggiano's dining chains. Libor (US0003M),
            the rate at which banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
            other, was set at 0.275 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Energy Watchdog May Seek to Punish Units, Workers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S.
            bank, was warned by federal energy-market regulators that its
            personnel and two subsidiaries may face claims stemming from a
            probe into bidding practices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Energy Regulatory Commission staff told JPMorgan in
            March they may recommend the agency bring an enforcement case,
            the New York-based company said yesterday in a regulatory
            filing. Claims may include 'alleged violations of FERC rules
            and the rules of certain independent system operators,' the
            lender said, without elaborating on the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FERC has stepped up scrutiny of corporations as it
            wields policing powers that were expanded in the wake of Enron
            Corp.'s 2001 collapse. Agency investigators may seek to hold
            JPMorgan traders and commodities-unit chief Blythe Masters
            'individually liable,' the New York Times reported last week,
            citing a 70-page document the watchdog sent the bank in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case focuses on eight 'schemes' adopted by traders in
            Houston between September 2010 and June 2011, according to the
            newspaper. Traders offered energy at prices 'calculated to
            falsely appear attractive,' prompting state authorities in
            California and Michigan to make about $83 million in
            'excessive' payments to JPMorgan, the Times cited
            investigators as saying. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Name Erik Bisso to Run CIO in North America</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has named Erik Bisso to run the bank's chief investment office for North
            America, according to an internal memo sent today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisso ran agency mortgage-backed securities pass-through
            trading for the New York-based bank, according to the memo, a
            copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. Bill Anast will
            join JPMorgan in August to replace Bisso in that role, a person
            familiar with the matter said. Anast previously ran the agency
            collateralized-mortgage obligation business at Barclays Plc. (BARC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisso's move 'demonstrates our ongoing commitment to
            developing senior talent and encouraging mobility across the
            firm,' Matt Cherwin, head of securitized products, and Craig Delany, who runs the global chief investment
            office, wrote in
            the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bisso will replace Irene Tse, the former head of the chief
            investment office in North America, who left the bank last year
            to start a hedge fund, people familiar with the plan said at the
            time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Liz Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan and Brandon
            Ashcraft of Barclays declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BlackRock Vote on Dimon's Future Highlights JPMorgan Link</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Rubin, a senior investment analyst at BlackRock Inc. (BLK) who picks financial-company stocks,
            didn't mince words a year ago when he e-mailed JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) right after the bank disclosed a
            trading loss that ultimately cost more than $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are very disappointed by
            this turn in events, not so much by the size of the loss, but more by the bad stumble in risk
            management/controls,' Rubin wrote, according to notes relayed to JPMorgan's management by Sarah Youngwood in
            the bank's investor-relations department. 'Major reputation and sentiment hit, damaging.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BlackRock,
            JPMorgan's biggest shareholder with a 6.5 percent stake, will cast a key vote this month on whether Jamie
            Dimon should be allowed to retain both his roles as chairman and chief executive officer even after last
            year's stumble. The vote pits Dimon, who runs the world's largest trading business, against BlackRock
            Chairman and CEO Larry Fink, who runs the world's biggest asset-management company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            vote could represent 'a clash of Too Big to Fails,' said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan
            College in Riverdale, New York, invoking the phrase used to describe companies whose collapse is deemed too
            damaging to the economy to be allowed. 'They're both strong personalities.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Buys $2.8 Billion of Argentine Bonds From Repsol</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S.
            bank, bought $2.8 billion of Argentine bonds at a discount from
            Repsol SA (REP) two days after the oil company received them as
            compensation for the government's seizure of its local unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds, due in 2024, have a nominal value of $3.25
            billion, the Spanish oil producer said in a regulatory filing in
            Madrid. The transaction is expected to close by May 13, and for
            seven days Repsol will refrain from selling its remaining
            Argentine bonds to other parties except under certain
            unspecified conditions, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol, Spain's largest oil producer, is reducing its ties
            to Argentina after receiving $5.32 billion of bonds as payment
            for the government's April 2012 nationalization of the company's
            51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF. JPMorgan probably
            believes it can resell the bonds to investors in the market,
            said Fernando Recalde, portfolio manager at Galileo Argentina SG
            FCI SA in Buenos Aires. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This was a way for Argentina to sell bonds indirectly,'
            Recalde said. 'It shows there's appetite for Argentine risk.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentine bonds have returned 11.7 percent this year,
            double the emerging-market average. South America's second-biggest economy hasn't sold bonds in
            international markets since
            its $95 billion default in 2001, and is locked in a dispute with
            some creditors in a case that is now before the U.S. Supreme
            Court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            JPMorgan, declined to comment on Repsol's announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'No Hurry' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's global 8.75 percent bonds due 2017, the closest
            in maturity to the 2024 notes, rallied 2.8 cents on the dollar
            today to 93.66 cents, bringing yields down to 11.26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Repsol disclosed that it had sold its
            remaining 12 percent equity stake in YPF for $1.3 billion
            through Morgan Stanley, another New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Antonio Brufau, who was Repsol's chief executive officer,
            said Feb. 26 said that the company probably would sell the
            Argentine bonds after receiving them, though it was in no hurry
            to do so. In addition to the 2024 bonds, the Madrid-based
            company received bonds due in 2015, 2017 and 2033. Brufau
            stepped down as CEO last week and is now executive chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said yesterday in a filing that the bonds have
            a market value of $4.67 billion, or $650 million below their
            nominal value. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Wells Fargo in Rolling Out Jumbo Offerings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Todd Vitale, a personal trainer who opened his own gym last year, said he was having difficulty
            getting a mortgage of more than $700,000 to buy a home in Greenwich, Connecticut, because his new business
            was untested. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitale then tried Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender,
            where he kept most of his savings in an account he opened more than a decade ago, he said. He worked with
            the bank's private mortgage unit, whose clients are entitled to loans of up to $6 million and personalized
            service, and had the opportunity to explain that he had already run a similar business and could make the
            gym succeed. Wells Fargo approved his 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of more than $700,000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't think I would have gotten a loan unless Wells Fargo private mortgage gave me a shot,' said
            Vitale, 38, who moved in to his new 3,000 square-foot home in February. 'I would have had to walk away from
            the home.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbos, or loans of at least $417,000 in most areas, are one of the few
            thriving pieces of an otherwise shrinking mortgage market. The biggest banks, including San Francisco-based
            Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp., are ratcheting up efforts to win wealthier
            borrowers while keeping credit tight for almost everyone else. Lenders are allowing assets in accounts to
            serve as collateral in lieu of down payments, cutting rates if customers have or set up investment accounts,
            rolling out new adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, and accepting lower down payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Applications
            Increase &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead,' said Paul Miller, a
            banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. based in Arlington, Virginia. 'Big banks need loan growth. If
            they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn't be so aggressive on competing for jumbos.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 4.9 percent in March
            from a year earlier, while requests for loans of less than $150,000 fell by 21 percent, according to the
            Mortgage Bankers Association. The average purchase application loan amount reached $280,500 in the week
            ended April 18, the highest since the survey started in January 1990, the MBA said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbos,
            also called non-conforming loans because they exceed the limit for government-backed Fannie Mae (FMCC) and
            Freddie Mac to guarantee, are loans of more than $625,500 in pricier markets such as Manhattan and Los
            Angeles. They're generally made to the most creditworthy borrowers with FICO scores of 760 on average and
            held by banks instead of being packaged into securities and sold to investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Job Cuts
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plunging mortgage lending at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. mortgage
            lender, dragged down their first-quarter earnings. Both banks are paring staff, with New York-based JPMorgan
            reducing the number of jobs at its mortgage unit by 30 percent, or 14,000 positions, since the start of last
            year. Wells Fargo got rid of 1,100 jobs in its residential mortgage business in the first quarter to keep
            expenses in line with demand for loans. Bank of America, the fourth-largest mortgage lender, swung to a
            surprise loss in the first quarter on costs tied to mortgage disputes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Refinancing,
            which drove lenders' profits last year, fell in the week ended April 25 to the lowest level since 2008,
            according to the MBA, after increases in borrowing rates. While the average rate for a 30-year fixed
            mortgage declined to 4.21 percent this week, it's still up almost a full percentage point from a near-record
            low last May, data from Freddie Mac show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lower Rates &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'That level
            of drop sends everyone everywhere looking for business,' said Joel Kan, director of economic forecasting at
            Washington-based MBA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenders are also vying for jumbos since they don't have to pay
            higher guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to insure the bonds, as they do with conforming
            loans, said Richard Lepre, an Alamo, California-based loan officer with RPM Mortgage. That means they can
            charge lower rates on jumbos, making them more attractive than traditional loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            rate at Wells Fargo for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage was 4.13 percent as of yesterday, compared with 4.25
            percent for a conventional 30-year fixed loan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan modified its guidelines in the
            third quarter for making jumbo loans to take into account a client's total assets at the bank. The bank made
            the change after seeing that customers who had long-term relationships with JPMorgan were less likely to
            default on their loans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Leverage Relationships &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lender created
            a separate process last year to review all declined loans to ensure those decisions made sense. It also set
            up a group that works with wealthy clients who have more complex financial situations, such as self-employed
            borrowers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We leverage relationships to let the customers know we really want to do
            business with them,' said Lesley Corydon, a senior vice president in the private client mortgage group at
            JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's jumbo mortgage originations represented 21 percent of its total
            originations in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 10 percent a year earlier, according to the bank.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customers of Chase Private Client, who have assets ranging from about $500,000 to $5
            million in total wealth, increasingly are opting to use their deposits and investments as collateral when
            borrowing. Some clients use the credit as bridge loans or to make larger down payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitale,
            the trainer who works with high school and college athletes at his Division 1 Prep gym, said he considered
            going to a non-bank, such as a hedge fund, for his home loan. He said he was dissuaded by the high rates and
            hoops he would have had to jump through to get the loan, compared with getting his Wells Fargo mortgage.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;100% Financing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased to know that Mr. Vitale received
            assistance with his home lending needs,' said Emmanuel Vuillequez, product manager for non-conforming
            mortgages at Wells Fargo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Wells Fargo created a team of 400 underwriters
            spread across six U.S. locations who just focus on jumbo loans. The bank is trying to win more jumbo
            business through better execution, deploying specially trained underwriters who can handle complicated deals
            and complete them by the closing date, Vuillequez said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Jumbo lenders are looking for
            ways to distinguish themselves from other jumbo lenders,' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage
            Finance, a trade publication in Bethesda, Maryland. 'Jumbo lending was the bright star of the mortgage
            market last year, so everyone is looking to ride that momentum into 2014.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Bank of
            New York Mellon Corp., where the average size of a mortgage is $1 million, clients can get 100 percent
            financing. They don't have to put any money down and can instead pledge assets in investment accounts as
            collateral, said Bill Sappington, head of private banking at the New York-based firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Smaller
            Deposits &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon earlier this year started offering customers the option to lock in
            mortgage rates for 90 days, instead of the typical 30-day term. The additional days give them more time to
            close knowing the rate is secure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America in October reduced the down payment to
            15 percent from 20 percent for most jumbos of less than $1 million. Existing customers at the bank may
            receive discounts on their mortgages based on their level of business with the firm, said Susan Atran, a
            Bank of America spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, nonconforming
            mortgage originations were 37 percent of overall loans made during the first quarter compared with 22
            percent a year earlier, according to the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RPM Mortgage this year began offering new
            jumbo adjustable-rate mortgages with initial low rates. One of their loan products provides a fixed rate for
            five years at a maximum of 2.63 percent, and then resets once during the next five years to no more than
            4.63 percent, Lepre said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Jumbo Defaults &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jumbo originations are
            still lower than they were before the financial crisis. A decade ago, jumbo ARMs helped fuel the housing
            bubble by letting buyers qualify for homes they could only afford at the low rates before they reset. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When home prices stopped climbing in mid-2006, both jumbo and conventional ARM borrowers began
            defaulting in higher numbers, contributing to the collapse of the mortgage market that in turn led to the
            most severe financial crisis in decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, demand for jumbos is growing as
            borrowers resume buying second homes or investment properties, according to Chase's Corydon. Banks are often
            fighting for loans in the $1 million to $2 million range, said Mike McPartland, head of lending for
            Citigroup Inc.'s (C) private bank in North America. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If in the past, I was competing
            with two private banks, now it feels like I'm competing with two private banks and two regional lenders for
            that $2 million mortgage,' said McPartland, whose clients generally have at least $25 million in net worth.
            'The benefit to working with a bank that knows you is we don't treat a mortgage like an isolated financial
            transaction.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest
            U.S. lender, opposed splitting Jamie Dimon's roles of chairman
            and chief executive officer because the change 'could be
            disruptive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board is made up of directors who are all independent
            other than Dimon and is led by a 'strong' presiding director,
            according to a letter sent today by two directors to
            stockholders of the New York-based company. The structure
            provides 'appropriate accountability to our shareholders and
            counterbalance to the combined CEO/Chair role,' according to
            the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The letter was written by former Exxon Mobil Corp. Chairman
            and CEO Lee R. Raymond, the board's presiding director, and
            former Johnson Johnson Chairman and CEO William C. Weldon, the
            chairman of JPMorgan's corporate governance and nominating
            committee. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Directors Oppose Splitting Dimon's Role as 'Disruptive'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s leading
            directors urged shareholders to reject calls for Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon to relinquish his dual role as chairman and
            chief executive officer, saying it 'could be disruptive' and
            against the best interests of investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An inflexible approach to the question of whether one
            person can serve as both chairman and CEO is not the right
            answer,' according to a letter today sent to shareholders of
            the New York-based company. It was signed by former Exxon Mobil
            Corp. Chairman and CEO Lee R. Raymond, who serves as the board's
            presiding director, and former Johnson Johnson Chairman and
            CEO William C. Weldon, who heads the panel's corporate
            governance and nominating committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proxy advisers at Glass Lewis Co. and Institutional
            Shareholder Services have told investors to vote for a separate
            chairman and oust some directors. Calls for Dimon, 57, to
            relinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when
            JPMorgan disclosed lapses in risk controls at its chief
            investment office in the so-called London Whale episode that led
            to at least $6.2 billion in losses on derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS on May 3 urged a vote in favor of splitting Dimon's
            roles and removing three directors. Glass Lewis urged
            shareholders May 7 to oust three members of the four-person risk
            committee as well as all three audit committee members following
            internal and congressional investigations that 'revealed
            questionable risk-management practices at both the senior
            management and board levels.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board's current structure provides 'appropriate
            accountability to our shareholders and counterbalance to the
            combined CEO/Chair role,' according to Raymond and Weldon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan May Evade Power-Trading Ban With Swaps, ISO Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit suspended
            from market-based power trading in California may be evading the
            ban through swap agreements with EDF Group and Cargill Inc.
            subsidiaries, the state's grid operator said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EDF Trading North America LLC signed a swap agreement with
            J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp.'s BE CA LLC unit for energy
            from units at three power plants in California for the six
            months that the JPMorgan subsidiary is banned from trading, the
            California Independent System Operator Corp. said in a filing to
            federal regulators yesterday. Cargill Power Markets LLC has also
            acquired control of units at two plants through a swap contract,
            the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The units covered by the EDF and Cargill contracts
            together comprise the total capacity previously controlled by
            JPMVEC and BE CA LLC in California,' Cal ISO said in the filing
            with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 'There is
            precedent for firms using swap contracts to secure a portion of
            the profit stream from a unit, while masking the identity of a
            party that has some level of control over the bidding.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, was warned by FERC in
            March that its personnel and two subsidiaries may face claims
            stemming from a probe into bidding practices. FERC revoked J.P.
            Morgan Ventures' right to trade power at market-based rates in
            California for six months starting in April, saying the firm
            provided misleading information to the ISO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Internal E-Mails &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC said in September it had initiated a proceeding
            against the energy trading unit focused on whether JPMorgan's
            energy division met its obligations to give documents to the
            ISO. J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy allegedly made bids that
            resulted in at least $73 million in improper payments to the
            generators, according to FERC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigation came to light when the commission went to
            court seeking internal e-mails from JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FERC has stepped up scrutiny of corporations as it wields
            policing powers that were expanded in the wake of Enron Corp.'s
            2001 collapse. The agency has announced since January 2011 at
            least 13 separate investigations of possible market
            manipulation, including probes of energy-trading units at
            Barclays Plc (BARC) and JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Through contracts with EDF and Cargill, JPMorgan could be
            bringing in profits during its suspension 'beyond those
            contemplated' by FERC in its order, Cal ISO said. The operator
            recommended broad changes that would capture any situation in
            which 'a market participant structured transactions to evade
            its suspension of market-based rate authority.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman in New York,
            declined to comment on the California ISO filing, saying the
            company is still reviewing it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deal Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California utility regulators approved a deal yesterday
            under which BE CA LLC would give Edison International (EIX)'s Southern
            California Edison unit all of its rights to energy from power-plant units in California beginning Oct. 1,
            when JPMorgan's
            trading suspension ends. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The tolling arrangement, which runs through May 2018,
            covers power from 12 natural gas-fired units at the Alamitos,
            Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach power plants in the Los
            Angeles Basin area with a total capacity of 3,690 megawatts, the
            resolution approved by the California Public Utilities
            Commission yesterday shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BE CA previously resold some tolling and resource adequacy
            rights from the units to Edison, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a separate proceeding today, FERC granted an April 10
            request from J.P. Morgan Ventures for rehearing on how it'll
            manage electricity sales in power markets outside California
            during its six-month suspension and gave the company 15 days to
            file more information. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Adcock Takeover May Value Company at $1.5 Billion, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Adcock Ingram Holdings Ltd. (AIP), South
            Africa's largest supplier of hospital products, may gain a
            further 12 percent from yesterday's 30-month high after it got
            takeover offers, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adcock's board has received non-binding proposals that
            could lead to an offer for the whole company or a controlling
            stake, the Johannesburg-based maker of Panado painkillers and
            Corenza cold medicine said yesterday. The stock rose 8.9 percent
            to 67.50 rand by the close in Johannesburg, its highest level
            since November 2010, valuing the company at $1.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The wording suggests there may be 'multiple bids for the
            company,' JPMorgan analysts Alex Comer and Avinash Kalkapersad
            wrote in a note dated yesterday. 'Under this scenario, we
            believe the stock could be worth 75.80 rand a share based on
            historic transaction multiples and a bid premium.' That would
            value Adcock at about $1.46 billion, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. The shares were down 0.4 percent at 67.24 rand by
            2:27 p.m. in Johannesburg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The approaches probably came from foreign companies as
            there are no obvious South African bidders other than Bidvest
            Group Ltd. (BVT), which had an offer for a controlling stake in Adcock
            rejected in March, Mathew Menezes, an analyst at Avior Research,
            said by phone from Johannesburg. The latest proposals aren't
            from Bidvest, Adcock said in yesterday's statement.
            Bidvest is still interested in a bid for Adcock and must get the
            same information as other bidders, Chief Executive Officer Brian
            Joffe said in an e-mailed response to questions today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bid Values &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adcock has had a marketing and distribution agreement with
            U.S.-based Merck Co. (MRK) to sell non-prescription medicines as
            well as treatments for high blood pressure since 2010. 'Adcock
            would also offer an acquirer a potential launch pad into the
            rest of Africa,' JPMorgan's Comer and Kalkapersad said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weakness in the South African rand has also made 'Adcock
            more attractive to potential international buyers,' the
            JPMorgan analysts wrote. The rand has declined 6.8 percent
            against the dollar this year, the worst performer of 24 emerging
            market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adcock shares have gained 6 percent in the past 12 months,
            compared with a 72 percent increase at larger competitor Aspen
            Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN), 18.2 percent owned by Brentford,
            England-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Weak Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adcock has fallen behind Aspen because of 'product losses,
            a previously weak tender performance, insipid over the counter
            markets and a weak rand,' JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bidvest offered to buy 60 percent of Adcock for about 6.2
            billion rand ($685 million) on March 22. The offer was half in
            cash, at 65 rand a share, and half in stock at a ratio of one
            Bidvest share for every four Adcock shares. The bid values
            Adcock at 64.94 a share at current prices, 3.4 percent below the
            stock's cost today. Bidvest said last month it would take the
            offer directly to shareholders in the absence of support from
            the board. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused by Harris of Illegal Collection Lawsuits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) was sued by
            California over claims that the biggest U.S. credit-card lender
            pursued lawsuits against defaulted borrowers based on
            insufficient evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From January 2008 to April 2011, JPMorgan filed more than
            100,000 debt-collection lawsuits in California, taking illegal
            shortcuts to obtain judgments against consumers, Harris claims
            in the lawsuit filed yesterday in state court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank couldn't have won the judgments so quickly if it
            had complied with minimum consumer protections under state law,
            according to the complaint. Harris said in a statement yesterday
            that the suit was filed to end 'widespread, illegal robo-signing' of court filings without the review of
            relevant files
            or bank records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chase abused the judicial process and engaged in serious
            misconduct against California credit-card borrowers,' Harris
            said in the statement. The lawsuit 'seeks to hold Chase
            accountable for systematically using illegal tactics to flood
            California's courts with specious lawsuits against consumers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            didn't immediately yesterday to phone and e-mail messages
            seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, based on alleged violations of
            California's unfair competition law, JPMorgan sent letters to
            consumers demanding payment of a balance due, claiming they may
            be liable for attorney's fees, and threatening to garnish income
            and place liens on property. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The correspondence is signed by a lawyer, though no lawyer
            reviewed the consumer's file to determine whether the claims and
            amounts due are correct, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is California v. JPMorgan Chase, BC508466,
            California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Be Betting Argentine Securities Will Gain</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) plans to hold
            some of the $3.25 billion of Argentine bonds it bought from
            Repsol SA as a wager the securities will rally and hasn't hedged
            them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the bank's
            strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year notes -- about
            86.6 cents on the dollar -- with the intent to sell them at a
            profit in the secondary market, said the person, who asked not
            to be identified because he isn't authorized to speak publicly
            about the matter. The bank sold some of the notes today and will
            keep some of the securities longer term, the person said,
            without giving amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman at the
            New York-based bank, declined to comment on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've moved about half of the bonds to large emerging-market dedicated investors,' Michael
            Roche, a strategist at
            Seaport Global Holdings LLC, said in a telephone interview,
            citing trades he's observed. 'There's just a growing desire to
            gain exposure to Argentina.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina gave the so-called Bonar bonds due 2024 to
            Spanish oil company Repsol in compensation for the takeover of
            51 percent of YPF SA (YPF) two years ago, in addition to bonds
            maturing in 2015, 2017 and 2033 for a total face value of $5.32
            billion. Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not
            to sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
            closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest securities firm by revenue, hired former Italian Finance
            Minister Vittorio Grilli as chairman of its corporate and
            investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grilli, 56, will be based in London and report to
            investment-banking head Daniel Pinto, according to a memorandum
            to employees sent by Pinto and obtained by Bloomberg News. A
            spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London confirmed the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grilli, who has spent most of his career in the civil
            service, will advise clients on European policy, markets and
            economic developments, according to the memo. Pinto is creating
            the position as he reorganizes the reporting lines after
            becoming sole investment-banking chief in March. Grilli was
            finance minister in Mario Monti's caretaker government,
            replacing Monti in that job in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He worked at the Italian Treasury from 1993 through 2000
            before joining Credit Suisse First Boston in 2001 for a year as
            head of Italian investment banking. After returning to Rome in
            2002 to serve as Italy's general accountant, he became head of
            the Treasury under the governments of Silvio Berlusconi and
            Romano Prodi. &lt;/p&gt;

            products commonly appended to credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said in a May 8 regulatory filing that it
            'expects that its banking supervisors will in the future continue
            to take more formal enforcement actions against the firm,'
            instead of 'issuing informal supervisory actions or criticisms.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is conducting
            an industrywide review of credit card add-on products, which can
            include debt cancellation and identity theft services. New York-based JPMorgan cited an identity theft
            product in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. stopped
            offering such add-on products entirely in the face of regulatory
            scrutiny. The bureau's first enforcement action was against
            Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which paid about $210 million in
            restitution and penalties over the products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Hartwick, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the bank had no
            comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets and deposits, is
            facing regulatory inquiries on its trading practices and conduct
            in the energy business. Shareholders are also considering at
            their May 21 meeting whether to separate the chairman and chief
            executive officer role, both currently held by Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan-Backed Developer Says Slump to Reverse: Corporate India</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Parsvnath Developers Ltd. (PARSV), an Indian
            builder that counts JPMorgan Chase Co. among project
            investors, says sales growth is rebounding after four quarters
            of declines, as rate cuts this year help revive the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real-estate company, which has 190 million square feet
            of land, is introducing new plans for buyers to sweeten offers
            and 'aggressively' selling units to double sales this quarter
            as demand picks up in the world's second-most populous country,
            Chairman Pradeep Jain said in an interview. Quarterly group
            revenue of Parsvnath slid an average 26 percent in 2012,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The overall economic situation isn't very great but is
            recovering,' Jain said in New Delhi, where Parsvnath is based.
            'End-user demand is good, particularly in Delhi and surrounding
            areas. You can see growth in sales from the current quarter.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's central bank has lowered borrowing costs three
            times in 2013, kindling optimism the property market will snap
            out of a slowdown that propelled unsold homes to a record in the
            final quarter of last year. Growth in the $1.8 trillion economy,
            Asia's third biggest, is set to accelerate from an estimated 5
            percent in the 12 months ended March 31, the least in a decade,
            according to government estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Share Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Parsvnath have dropped 37 percent in the past
            year, making it the worst performing stock in the SP BSE India
            Realty Index. DLF Ltd. (DLFU), India's biggest developer whose market
            value of 403 billion rupees ($7.4 billion) is 26 times that of
            Jain's company, has gained 24 percent in the period. The
            benchmark SP BSE Sensex index has climbed 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's private-equity unit had paid 2.6 billion rupees
            in December, 2010 for a 22 percent stake at Parsvnath's La
            Tropicana residential project in the nation's capital, according
            to Jain, while Sun-Apollo Ventures LLC and Red Fort Capital are
            other funds that have invested in its other projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parsvnath has introduced a plan that allows buyers to pay
            25 percent of the property's cost on booking, and the rest while
            taking possession with no extra cost built in and no loans
            involved. The offer, which Jain said will lure buyers and boost
            profit, is for four commercial and 16 residential projects
            across India. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very risky move for a developer, especially if it
            is a falling property market,' said Parikshit Kandpal, a
            Mumbai-based analyst at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. 'The risk is
            entirely on the developer as there's no customer's bank loan to
            back up the sale.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Most Expensive &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Home prices in Mumbai, India's most expensive real estate
            market, rose to a record high of 11,626 rupees a square foot in
            the quarter ended March 31, according to data from Liases Foras
            Real Estate Rating Research Pvt., driven by speculation demand
            will pick up. In the capital region, where Parsvnath operates,
            prices have risen 21 percent since June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the previous quarter, the stock of unsold homes at new
            residential projects climbed to a record, as rising prices
            crimped affordability in the nation's biggest cities, according
            to Pankaj Kapoor, founder of property research company Liases.
            Total unsold inventory of residential stock in the six major
            cities tracked by Liases Foras climbed to 100 million square
            feet (9.3 million square meters), the highest since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interest rates, which are still near a two-year high, and a
            cultural aversion to debt account for India's relatively low
            home-loan penetration rates. Home loan debt of $104 billion is
            equal to 8 percent of gross domestic product compared with 20
            percent in China and 77 percent in the U.S., according to data
            compiled by Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Worst Is Over &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Indian mortgage rates, at 10 percent on average, are among
            the highest in Asia. That compares with about 2 percent in Hong
            Kong, 6.5 percent in China, and 6 percent in South Korea,
            according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The worst for the industry is over, Jain said separately on
            May 9, adding the environment is 'changing for the better.'
            Prices may increase as much as 18 percent annually, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Real-estate stocks in India are looking more attractive as
            borrowing costs decline and demand for homes support property
            prices, according to CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. The 11-member
            SP BSE India Realty Index has rebounded 9 percent from a five-month low reached on April 9. It is still 18
            percent lower than
            its 21-month high reached on Jan. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Residential volumes continued to hold up in the first
            quarter of 2013,' Mahesh Nandurkar and Abhinav Sinha, Mumbai-based analysts at CLSA, wrote in a note to
            clients on April 17.
            'With residential volumes holding well and chances of interest-rate cuts increasing, property stocks are
            offering attractive
            entry points.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rate Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts the Reserve Bank of
            India will extend its rate reductions with four more for a total
            of 1 percentage point through the end of March. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao lowered the benchmark repurchase
            rate in March and May,
            both times signaling there's little space for further cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales volumes have picked up in some markets with signs of
            an economic revival and a rebound in stocks, according to
            Karvy's Kandpal. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram last
            month predicted growth of as much as 6.7 percent in the year
            that started April 1, from an estimated 5 percent in the
            previous 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Over the earlier part of the past 12 months, many issues
            with the sector caused 'a massive underperformance of listed
            realty stock,' Kandpal wrote in a research note last month.
            'There's been a marked shift during the latter part of the last
            six months.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Stock Would Decline 10% If Dimon Leaves Bank, Mayo Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) shares would
            probably fall by about 10 percent if Chief Executive Officer
            Jamie Dimon leaves the company, Mike Mayo, an analyst at CSLA
            Ltd., said today in a research note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender's market value would likely drop by about $20
            billion if shareholders vote on May 21 to strip Dimon of his
            chairman role and he leaves as some analysts predict, Mayo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock would suffer because the New York-based bank has
            no obvious successor to Dimon, 57, who is top-ranked among large
            bank CEOs, Mayo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined 0.2 percent to $48.85 at 10:42 a.m. in
            New York. The shares have gained 11 percent this year, compared
            with the 14 percent advance of the 24-company KBW Bank Index. (BKX) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $2 Billion for More Argentina Bonds From Repsol</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
            Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
            billion, bringing its purchases of the country's securities to
            about $5 billion in less than a week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to purchase Argentine bonds due in 2015,
            2017 and 2033, Madrid-based Repsol said in a filing. The oil
            company said last week that it agreed to sell Argentine
            government bonds due in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol's efforts to
            reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
            its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
            Under an agreement Repsol with the government reached earlier
            this year, Repsol last week received $5.32 billion of bonds as
            compensation for the seizure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction disclosed today is expected to be completed
            by the end of this week, according to the filing. Repsol said it
            sold all of its securities due in 2017 and 2033 and all but $117
            million of those due in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol previously had said it received $500 million of the
            2017 securities from Argentina, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds
            and $317 million of those due in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has already sold some of the Argentine
            bonds received from the first purchase, is wagering that its
            remaining holdings will gain in value, a person with direct
            knowledge of the bank's strategy said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Bets 46% Surge Not Done With Bond Buy: Argentina Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is betting the
            world's biggest bond gains are far from over. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank bought $3.25 billion of Argentine
            bonds from Repsol SA (REP) as a wager the notes will rally and hasn't
            hedged them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
            bank's strategy. It paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year debt, or
            about 86.6 cents on the dollar, and will keep some of the bonds
            longer-term, said the person, who asked not to be identified
            because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's bonds, rated seven levels below investment
            grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most among
            emerging-market government debt, as the country repairs ties
            with the International Monetary Fund and seeks to stem a drop in
            the foreign reserves it uses to pay debt. The government gave
            the Bonar notes due in 2024 to Madrid-based Repsol as
            compensation after seizing 51 percent of YPF SA two years ago,
            as part of a package with a total face value of $5.32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People were aching to be a part of the Argentine story,'
            Patrick Esteruelas, senior sovereign analyst at Emso Partners
            Ltd., which oversees about $2 billion, said in an interview in
            New York. 'It's a junk credit, but it's a credit that people
            are evaluating as part of a broad convergence play.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Repsol Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold some of the notes and will keep some with the
            intent to sell at a profit, the person said, without giving
            amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
            to comment on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not to
            sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
            closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold some of the 2024 securities for about 86.75
            cents on the dollar to at least two investment firms, according
            to two people familiar with the transactions. The 8.75 percent
            notes were trading late yesterday at 88.35 cents on the dollar,
            with a yield of 10.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given prices on other Argentine government bonds, the 2024
            notes should be about 8 cents higher at 96.5 cents on the dollar
            with a yield of 9.4 percent, according to a May 12 report by
            Citigroup Inc. strategists Jeff Williams and Guillermo Mondino. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's notes due in 2017 traded at 92.4 cents on the
            dollar with a 10.3 percent yield. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Steady Increase' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which opened its first office in Buenos Aires in
            1978, sold about half of the bonds, according to Michael Roche,
            a strategist at Seaport Global Holdings LLC, citing trades he's
            observed. The country hasn't issued international bonds since it
            defaulted on $95 billion of debt in 2001. It restructured 93
            percent of the debt in swaps in 2005 and 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've demonstrated that they're able to access
            international capital markets,' Roche said in a telephone
            interview from New York. 'We're continuing to see a steady
            increase in the breadth of investors interested in getting
            exposure to Argentina.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joshua Rosner, managing director and bank analyst at Graham
            Fisher Co., said JPMorgan is making a risky bet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They may be betting that the government will ultimately
            act rationally,' he said in a telephone interview from New
            York. 'If they didn't hedge it, and are holding this for their
            own portfolios, it's a wildly risky thing to do especially given
            the statements and actions of the government.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Regime Change &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since taking office in 2007, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has also seized $24 billion
            of private pension funds
            and flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas SA. The country still
            hasn't settled claims with defaulted-debt creditors demanding
            full payment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fernandez's efforts to mend ties with overseas creditors
            and the prospect of a new government after elections next year
            will spark further bond gains, Seaport Global's Roche said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina revamped its economic data indexes earlier this
            year at the behest of the IMF, which had censured the country
            for inaccurate inflation and growth figures in 2013. It has also
            settled with five companies in the World Bank's arbitration arm
            and is in negotiations with the Paris Club of creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors are pretty convinced that a new political force
            at the new elections will continue to normalize the country's
            relations with international investors,' Roche said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s revenue from
            its markets businesses, which include trading of bonds and
            equities, is about 10 percent to 15 percent greater so far this
            quarter than the year-earlier period, a senior executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Cavanagh, co-head of JPMorgan's corporate and
            investment bank, made the remark at a conference in New York
            hosted by UBS AG (UBSN), according to a transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue from markets businesses are 'running about 10
            percent to 15 percent higher than the second quarter of 2012,'
            he said. The revenue is 'still down a bit from the typically
            strong first quarter that we just had.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks' trading units usually generate their
            greatest profits in the first quarter, in part because
            corporations raise more debt at the beginning of the year,
            stoking fixed-income operations. A jump in second-quarter
            trading earnings from a year earlier would mark a turnaround for
            JPMorgan after revenue from that business slipped 5.4 percent in
            2013's first three months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, rose 1.4 percent
            to $50.38 at 11:08 a.m. in New York. The stock has climbed 15
            percent so far this year, compared with a 16 percent advance in
            the 24-company KBW Bank Index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Greenspan Says JPMorgan Like Fannie Mae With U.S. Backing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is akin to Fannie Mae
            and
            Freddie Mac because taxpayers would shoulder the burden of its
            rescue in an emergency, rather than let it collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, is an example of implicit
            government guarantees not measured in the nation's official
            public-debt statistics, Greenspan, 88, said today at a forum in
            Washington organized by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. The
            reality is that the government would prop up many financial
            firms and other companies if needed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan is a Fannie Mae-, Freddie Mac-type of
            institution, because they are indeed too big to fail, and
            taxpayer monies will come in behind them to hold them up if
            necessary,' said Greenspan. He sat on New York-based JPMorgan's
            board before his appointment to Fed chairman in 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Housing financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy
            loans and package them into securities, were taken into
            government conservatorship during the financial crisis and
            received $187.5 billion in taxpayer funds to stay afloat before
            a market turnaround propelled them to record profits. The pair
            now back about two-thirds of new U.S. home-loan originations. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Pays $2 Billion for More of Repsol's Argentine Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
            Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
            billion, bringing its purchases of the Latin American country's
            securities to almost $5 billion in the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will buy Argentine bonds due in 2015, 2017 and
            2033, Madrid-based Repsol said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
            The oil company agreed last week to sell new Argentine bonds due
            in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. Those bonds have since
            rallied 1.7 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol's efforts to
            reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
            its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
            Under an agreement reached with the government earlier this
            year, Repsol received bonds last week with a face value of $5.32
            billion as compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has now bought almost all of that. The New York-based bank, which has already sold some of
            the Argentine bonds
            received from the first purchase, is wagering that the remaining
            holdings will gain in value, a person with direct knowledge of
            the bank's strategy said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's bonds, rated seven levels below investment
            grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most in
            emerging markets, as the country took steps to repair ties with
            international investors, including Repsol and the International
            Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Riskiest Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country's debt is still considered risky, with the cost
            of five-year protection in the credit-default swaps market at
            1,567 basis points, according to CMA, the highest in the world.
            The country hasn't sold bonds directly to international markets
            since a $95 billion default in 2001, and it's locked in a
            dispute with some creditors in a case now before the U.S.
            Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction disclosed yesterday is expected to be
            completed by May 16, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale included all of Repsol's Argentine securities due
            in 2017 and 2033 and all except $117 million of those due in
            2015, known as Bodens, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Boden bonds maturing 2015 gained 0.20 cent to 97.65 cents
            on the dollar at 9:31 a.m. in New York, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol previously said it had $500 million of the 2017
            securities, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds and $317 million of
            the 2015 debt. All the securities are governed by Argentine law. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Yuan Band Widening in 3 Months After SAFE Rule</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. said China may
            widen the yuan's trading band in the next three months after the
            foreign-exchange regulator announced rules to deter speculative
            funds from betting on appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said May 5 it
            would put in measures to increase monitoring of cross-border
            trade flows and ordered banks to adjust currency positions so
            that dollar loans are kept at a certain proportion to deposits.
            Patrick Wu, head of yuan trading at JPMorgan, the largest U.S.
            bank by assets, said the move may be part of preparations to
            broaden the band. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If SAFE widened the band without the new measure, it
            would trigger more speculation,' Wu said in an interview
            yesterday in Shanghai. 'However, if they introduce the measure,
            it would be more helpful to push down the yuan's spot level and
            give SAFE more room to widen the band because corporates and
            banks will have to reduce short-dollar positions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government has pledged to allow more flexibility in the
            exchange rate and promote freer movement of capital in and out
            of the country for investment purposes. China's State Council,
            or cabinet, signaled May 6 it will propose plans this year for
            yuan capital-account convertibility. The central bank last
            widened the band in April 2012, to 1 percent from 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Yuan Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The People's Bank of China sets a daily reference rate
            against the dollar around 9:15 a.m. in Shanghai. The yuan has
            been within 0.1 percent of the upper limit on most days since
            October. The fixing was weakened 0.06 percent to 6.2070 today.
            Wu said the reference rate may strengthen to 6.10 by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There will be fewer speculative foreign-exchange trades
            in the onshore market because banks have limitations in making
            loans for corporates to go long on the yuan and short on
            dollars,' said Wu. 'The whole outlook for the yuan still
            remains unchanged.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yuan weakened 0.06 percent to 6.1462 per dollar as of
            2:22 p.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
            Trade System. It touched 6.1307 on May 9, the strongest level
            since the government unified official and market exchange rates
            at the end of 1993. A long position is a bet that a currency
            will appreciate while a short position anticipates a decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's currency has appreciated 1.5 percent in the last
            three months, the third-best performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the
            Mexican peso
            and Malaysia's ringgit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Around June &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Widening of the band is likely in June or shortly after,
            Credit Agricole CIB strategist Dariusz Kowalczyk wrote in a
            research note on May 7. With the new foreign-exchange position
            limits for banks, policy makers were likely trying to reduce
            speculative capital and prepare ground for foreign-exchange
            regime relaxation, Hong Kong-based Kowalczyk said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The band may be expanded around June, before the U.S.-China
            Strategic Economic Dialogue in Washington during the week of
            July 8-12, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Christy Tan
            in Singapore wrote in a report on April 24. The PBOC may widen
            the band against the dollar to 1.5 percent or 2 percent, while
            1.5 percent is more likely, Tan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China is testing the yuan's exchange-rate equilibrium and
            may soon double its trading band, Shanghai Securities News
            reported May 13, citing people it didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A widening is likely 'in the near future,' People's Bank
            of China Deputy Governor Yi Gang said in April. China will push
            ahead with opening its capital account because current economic
            conditions are favorable, Yi said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One-year implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
            of exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose nine basis
            points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.43 percent, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. That's the highest since Jan. 15. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Elliott Said to Buy JPMorgan in Volatility Trade Last Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Elliott Management Corp. built a
            $44.2 million position in JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) during the first
            quarter even as the hedge-fund company's founder said it was
            impossible to determine how risky financial institutions are. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stake was part of an option-related volatility trading
            position that Elliott no longer owns and wasn't a bet on the
            bank itself, according to a person familiar with the strategy
            who asked for anonymity because he wasn't authorized to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, was Elliott
            Management's second-biggest new purchase by market value during
            the three months ended March 31, according to a regulatory
            filing today. The hedge-fund company bought 931,069 shares of
            New York-based JPMorgan, according to the filing. The biggest
            new buy was 2.88 million shares of Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) valued at
            $141.2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Singer, Elliott's billionaire president, provoked a
            testy response from Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief
            executive officer, when he criticized the opacity and leverage
            in the global financial system as the two participated in a
            panel discussion about banking regulation at the World Economic
            Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during late January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One doesn't know from disclosures, and one can't find out
            from disclosures, whether each of the very large global
            financial institutions are actually risky or sound,' Singer
            said at the panel, which was broadcast on CNBC. Dimon, 57,
            responded by describing some of the bank's disclosures and
            telling Singer that 'hedge funds are pretty opaque, too.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Advances &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has gained 16 percent so far this year, in line
            with the performance of the Standard Poor's 500 Index and the
            Dow Jones Industrial Average, of which JPMorgan is one of 30
            components. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Singer also advocated separating trading businesses from
            banks funded with federally guaranteed deposits as 'extremely
            useful in normalizing the financial system.' Dimon, whose bank
            had $1.2 trillion of deposits at the end of March as well as
            Wall Street's biggest trading business by revenue, has said that
            big, diverse banks like JPMorgan help the economy grow and can
            be sources of financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At an investor conference in New York last week, Singer
            made it clear that his views on banks haven't changed since he
            spoke in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Four and a half years after the crisis, banks are
            opaque,' Singer said on May 8 at the Sohn Investment
            Conference. 'The financial system is highly leveraged and
            opaque.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sues Portugal-Owned Companies to Enforce Swaps</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sued state-owned
            Portuguese companies running the Lisbon and Oporto metro rail
            services, as well as the country's strategic oil reserves, to
            enforce derivative contracts worth at least 455 million euros
            ($587 million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan filed the lawsuits in London on April 26, the same
            day Portugal made a deal with other banks to reduce its 3
            billion-euro exposure to derivatives entered into by state-owned
            firms. The government failed to reach an agreement with JPMorgan
            and Banco Santander SA's Portuguese unit, and said it would sue
            to defend its interests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We were forced to take protective measures in the English
            courts' following the April announcement by Portugal, JPMorgan
            spokesman Brian Marchiony said in an e-mail. The New York-based
            bank remains open to negotiations and the contracts aren't in
            default, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are turning to U.K. courts to resolve swaps disputes
            with local governments and state-owned companies that say they
            lost money on complex derivatives. More than half a dozen
            Italian municipalities are embroiled in legal disputes with
            investment banks in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Maria Luis Albuquerque, Portugal's secretary of state for
            treasury and finance, described the country's hedging contracts
            as 'toxic' with 'elevated risks,' when she announced the
            April deal. An official at Portugal's finance ministry declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Santander Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Santander's Portugal-based unit also sued the Oporto and
            Lisbon metro and bus companies in London on May 10. Peter
            Greiff, a Santander spokesman in Madrid, didn't immediately
            return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Metropolitano de Lisboa had at least 455 million euros of
            swap contracts with the JPMorgan at the end of 2011, as measured
            by notional value, according to the company's annual report. The
            disclosed JPMorgan contracts had a negative value of 221 million
            euros, Metropolitano de Lisboa said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Marchiony said in an e-mailed statement the
            figures weren't accurate and declined to comment further. A
            Metro de Lisboa spokesman declined to comment beyond the
            company's filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Metro Porto had 120 million euros of outstanding loans with
            JPMorgan at the end of 2011 according to its annual report,
            which didn't disclose details of derivatives held with the bank.
            The Strategic Oil Reserve Fund didn't disclose details of its
            derivative counterparties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are: JP Morgan Securities PLC v. Metropolitano de
            Lisboa EP, High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division,

        <headline>JPMorgan Asset Plans U.K.'s First Convertible Investment Trust</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management, the money
            management unit of the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it's
            starting the U.K.'s first investment trust dedicated to global
            convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Global Convertibles Income Fund will be set up
            as a closed-end fund, which has a fixed number of shares,
            targeting a 4.5 percent yield through dividend income and
            capital growth, according to Antony Vallee, the unit's London-based head of convertible bonds. The
            closed-end structure will
            add flexibility to the investment strategy by avoiding the need
            to hold cash and the most liquid securities to meet potential
            withdrawals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Convertible debt combines a bond with an option to buy a
            preset amount of stock, allowing lenders to share in gains from
            the growth or revival of borrowers while offering the same
            protection of capital as a traditional bond. New issuance, which
            soared to more than $10 billion in the first quarter, a record
            for the period in Europe, stalled in recent weeks as improving
            economic indicators in some regions encourage chief financial
            officers and other managers to view their stock as undervalued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Few CFOs in the world are happy to issue convertibles
            because of the dilution,' Vallee said at a presentation
            today. 'Right now they're looking at the U.S. and Japan and
            expecting that equities will go up. When companies need some
            money they will come back.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund plans to raise at least 100 million pounds
            ($152 million) and its size is capped at 300 million pounds. The
            directors plan to prevent its value falling to a discount of
            more than 5 percent to net asset value by buying back stock
            where necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares of the investment trust are expected to start
            trading by the middle of next month, according to the term
            sheet. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are issuing lower-ranked bonds
            and preferred securities in the U.S. at the fastest pace since
            the financial crisis, capitalizing on yield-starved investors to
            satisfy regulatory requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and
            Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) are meeting demands to raise more capital by
            selling $31.8 billion of subordinated debt and preferred shares
            this year, with $22.7 billion in March and April alone,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of issuance is
            the fastest since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders need to sell the notes in part because new
            regulations designed to make banks safer have rendered a
            previously popular form -- called trust-preferred securities --
            useless for capital purposes, ruling it must be replaced by
            2016. Now that banks' creditworthiness has improved, investors
            are snapping up the offerings because they can pay more than one
            percentage point of extra interest over senior bonds that rank
            higher for repayment in a bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'From an investor perspective, it is incremental yield in
            a historically low-rate environment,' Pri de Silva, an analyst
            at New York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a May 6 telephone
            interview. 'The credit profiles of banks are a lot better now
            than they were in the pre-crisis days.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Losing Funding &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo in April sold $2 billion of 5.9 percent
            perpetual securities after initially marketing the debt with a
            higher coupon of as much as 6.125 percent, Bloomberg data show.
            The notes offered interest payments of more than two percentage
            points above the 3 percent senior notes due in 2021 that the San
            Francisco-based bank sold in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Subordinated debt and preferred shares are replacing trust-preferred securities, known as TruPS,
            which were popular before
            the crisis in part because interest payments were tax-deductible. About $149 billion were outstanding at the
            end of
            2008, according to Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks could also count TruPS as Tier 1 capital because they
            allowed issuers to stop paying interest and were supposed to act
            as a buffer against potential losses. Lenders proved reluctant
            to suspend payments during the crisis because those that did
            risked losing other funding on concerns about their solvency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Regulations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators, implementing the international Basel III
            accord and U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, have ruled that banks with
            assets of more than $15 billion can't count TruPS as Tier 1
            capital anymore. They have until 2016 to replace the securities,
            and common equity and preferred shares are the main types that
            count as Tier 1 capital. Subordinated debt counts as Tier 2
            capital, which banks are also required to maintain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Attention in Europe has focused on additional Tier 1 notes,
            a similar-level as preferred shares in the U.S., where issuance
            has soared this year to $25.7 billion, Bloomberg data show. A
            total of $36.5 billion of the debt is outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Under the new rules, there is a space in the capital
            structure that could be filled with subordinated debt, common
            equity or preferred equity,' de Silva said. The latter two
            'are generally more expensive, so in order to meet that capital
            need cost-effectively, they have been issuing subordinated
            debt.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank Safety &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The issuance comes as confidence in bank creditworthiness
            improves. The average cost to protect against defaults by the
            six-largest U.S. banks fell this week to the lowest level since
            the end of 2007, according to credit-default swaps prices
            compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts, a gauge of the banks'
            risk, are used to hedge against losses or to speculate on the
            ability of companies to meet their obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Without question, the banks are more stable,' said
            Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial Capital LLC.
            'Even under the most extreme economic scenarios, banks should
            have enough capital to withstand a shock, so investors are more
            comfortable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While subordinated debtholders may not be bailed out in
            another crisis, 'people are not particularly worried about that
            right now,' said Kathleen Shanley, a New York-based analyst at
            Gimme Credit LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emboldened by improving bank creditworthiness, investors
            are eager to buy their higher-yielding debt after more than five
            years of near-zero interest rates from the Fed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is this year's biggest bank issuer of the
            securities, selling $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
            The New York-based lender sold $1 billion of perpetual
            securities on March 5 that pay interest of 6.125 percent for a
            decade and then switch to a floating-rate coupon. The notes were
            initially marketed with a coupon of as much as 6.25 percent,
            according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They climbed about 0.1 cent to 101.3 cents on the dollar at
            9:18 a.m. in New York, rising for the sixth consecutive day,
            Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The way the credit markets have been running, almost
            everything that comes is well oversubscribed,' said Thomas Urano, a money manager at Austin, Texas-based
            Sage Advisory
            Services Ltd., which oversees about $10 billion. 'The trends
            have been favorable for banks to be able to place it.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names Ventresca, Cristerna as Global M&amp;amp;A Co-Heads</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the largest
            U.S. bank by assets, named Chris Ventresca and Hernan Cristerna
            as co-heads of global mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ventresca, 46, previously was JPMorgan's head of North
            American MA, while Cristerna, 48, oversaw MA for Europe,
            Middle East and Africa, according to a memo obtained today by
            Bloomberg News. They will report to Jeff Urwin, global head of
            investment banking. Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, confirmed the memo's contents.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, is
            overhauling top management on its MA team. Ventresca and
            Cristerna will have global responsibilities, with each
            overseeing their former regions, Pelio said. They will share
            responsibility for deals in Asia, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Combining global MA under two leaders streamlines the
            bank's decision-making, Ventresca said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We can move more quickly with common leadership,'
            Ventresca said. 'When an opportunity arises, we can put the
            right advisory resources in place.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until February, Ventresca shared oversight of North
            American MA with Jim Woolery, 44, who left the company that
            month to become deputy chairman at corporate law firm Cadwalader
            Wickersham Taft LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads Surge in Indonesia-Tied Note Sales to 3-Year High</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of structured notes tied to
            Indonesia's sovereign debt surged to the most in three years,
            led by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), as investors seek to capitalize on
            the second-highest yields among major Asian economies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of notes linked to Indonesian government bonds jumped
            to the equivalent of $519.7 million this year through May 14, 89
            percent higher than the same period of 2012, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The volume is the highest since 2010 and
            90 percent of the products were issued by JPMorgan, which rose
            to No. 1 after being ranked eighth last year, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas investors pumped a net 18 trillion rupiah ($1.8
            billion) into local-currency sovereign notes in April, pushing
            holdings to a record 299 trillion rupiah, according to the
            finance ministry data. The country's 10-year bonds yielded 5.55
            percent yesterday, the highest behind Indian debt among 14 Asia-Pacific countries tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For foreign investors, Indonesia 'offers high yield, but
            the risk is controllable,' said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, head of
            treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan on May 6 issued the largest notes tied to
            Indonesia this year in a 1.93 trillion rupiah offering. The 20-year securities, issued at a 4.4 percent
            premium, both pay a
            6.625 percent annual coupon and are redeemed in U.S. dollars.
            The U.S. currency gained against the rupiah for two consecutive
            years through 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Polly Leung, a spokeswoman at JPMorgan in Hong Kong,
            declined to comment on the notes. Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) and
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) have also issued the securities this year,
            according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of the products sold this year have
            maturities of 10 years or longer, Bloomberg data show. Such
            tenors are popular among pension funds and other foreign
            institutional buyers, as they tend to seek long-term
            investments, Nurbaeti said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Indonesia on May 14 kept interest rates unchanged for a
            15th consecutive time as predicted. The central bank won't
            resist raising rates if needed, Assistant Governor Hendar said
            May 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Poor's cut its rating outlook on Indonesia's
            debt to stable from positive this month, citing slow progress in
            improving infrastructure, regulatory uncertainty and
            bureaucratic obstacles. The agency ranks the country at its
            highest junk level, while Fitch Ratings Ltd. and Moody's
            Investors Service restored Indonesia to investment grades in
            December 2011 and January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, RBC Win N.J. Tax Grants Valued at $300 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;New Jersey awarded JPMorgan Chase (JPM)
            Co. and RBC Capital Markets $300 million of tax credits over 10
            years after the companies pledged to create 1,900 new jobs in
            Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Economic Development Authority approved annual grants
            of $22.5 million for JPMorgan and $7.9 million for RBC at a
            meeting today in Trenton. JPMorgan's project would add 1,000
            jobs and retain 2,612, while RBC's would add 900 positions,
            according to their applications. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, in its application, said it has been evaluating
            the location of its expanding regional technology and operations
            hub. Its options included consolidating multiple New Jersey
            facilities into one in Jersey City or relocating most of those
            operations to lower-cost locations in Delaware and Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBC leases space in five locations in Manhattan with about
            2,700 employees. With leases expiring at One Liberty Plaza and
            the World Financial Center, it began evaluating options,
            including renovating and expanding space in Jersey City and in
            Minnesota. While the one-time cost of expanding would be greater
            in Minnesota, annual operating costs would be higher in New
            Jersey, according to its application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Financial services up in the Jersey City and Hoboken area
            has always been a sweet spot for us,' Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the state's top economic-development
            official, said in
            an interview. 'It's a perfect story: As New York's financial-services sector looks for other places to go,
            they want to look
            some place convenient to New York.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Earners &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The median salary of $120,000 for the covered positions at
            JPMorgan, listed on its application, is more than triple New
            Jersey's median of $35,928, according to the Census Bureau. RBC
            listed the median salary at $126,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financial positions have become increasingly coveted as
            states look to poach jobs from neighbors and even far-away
            locales. Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, today said his
            state is actively recruiting New York companies to move there. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This would not impact the location of our U.S.
            headquarters, which remains in lower Manhattan and will continue
            to house the majority of our employees,' RBC spokeswoman Elisa
            Barsotti said in a statement. 'We are exploring an upgraded
            location to relocate our data center from our ancillary location
            at One Liberty Plaza and support function positions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Two Centuries &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan project is expected to bring a net benefit to
            the state of $1.1 billion over the life of the package and will
            enlarge the company's space in Jersey City to more than 1
            million square feet, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've invested in this community for nearly two
            centuries, and this agreement only deepens that commitment for
            the long term,' JPMorgan Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames
            said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guadagno, a Republican who serves as the state's economic
            development chief, said New Jersey has aggressively courted
            financial-services jobs with a message to decision makers to
            keep their New York address and move support jobs to New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jersey City, a community of 254,000 one stop from Manhattan
            by train, has worked in the past decade to re-craft itself as
            Wall Street West. Mayor Steven Fulop, 37, worked at Citigroup
            Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., leaving after the 2001 World
            Trade Center attacks to join the U.S. Marine Corps and serve in
            Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lifting State &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jersey City is leading the state economy in terms of job
            creation and is the driving force in lifting New Jersey out of
            the recession,' he said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New Jersey has struggled to shake off the lingering effects
            of the U.S. recession that ended in 2009. Governor Chris Christie's administration said yesterday that the
            jobless rate
            slid to 6.9 percent in April, the first time it has dipped under
            7 percent since November 2008. The national level was 6.3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The state has regained 125,700 jobs, or about half of those
            lost during the slump. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers
            Economic Advisory Service, said this month that the state isn't
            expected to recover all of them until 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Citigroup, JPMorgan Shortlisted to Advise on Slovak Telekom Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) were shortlisted to advise Slovakia on a 1 billion-euro
            ($1.4 billion) sale of the country's largest phone company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government's National Property Fund, which oversees
            state-asset sales, will by the end of May pick one or both banks
            to advise on the sale of a 49 percent stake in Slovak Telekom
            AS, Miriam Ziakova, a spokeswoman for the fund, said by phone
            today. The sale will be completed by the end of the year, she
            said. Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) owns 51 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slovakia is selling assets to raise funds for cutting
            public debt, which last year exceeded 55 percent of gross
            domestic product. The Finance Ministry estimates that Slovak
            Telekom's sale will bring in the equivalent of 1.3 percent of
            GDP next year, according to its budgetary framework for 2015
            posted on the government's website last month. The ministry
            forecasts 2015 nominal GDP at 77.8 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government prefers to sell its shares in an initial
            public offering, according to a memorandum between the state and
            Deutsche Telekom. The German operator, which bought its stake in
            the former fixed-line monopoly in 2000, has a pre-purchase right
            if a direct sale to an investor is chosen, the memorandum says. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dexia Suit Against JPMorgan Revived, Sent to N.Y. Court</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Dexia SA (DEXB)'s lawsuit against JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) over about $1.6 billion in mortgage-backed
            securities was revived by a federal judge who found that he had
            lacked the jurisdiction to dismiss it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan issued an order
            today vacating his April decision and sending the case to New
            York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Those who don't believe in ghosts have never been in
            court, where legal claims are regularly seen rising from the
            grave,' Rakoff wrote in his order. 'This is a case in point.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rakoff last month dismissed most of the suit, in which
            Dexia accused JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual
            Inc. of 'egregious fraud' in the sale of mortgage bonds.
            Dexia, based in Brussels, sued the lenders in 2012, claiming
            that loans backing securities purchased between 2005 and 2007
            were riskier than promised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased assets of Washington Mutual and Bear
            Stearns after they collapsed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After Rakoff's April ruling, a federal appeals court in
            Manhattan found that the Edge Act, a law that regulates
            international banking, didn't give a federal court jurisdiction
            over a similar lawsuit filed by American International Group
            Inc. against Bank of America Corp. (BAC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In light of that decision, Rakoff concluded that he didn't
            have jurisdiction over Dexia's case and that it belonged in
            state court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on Rakoff's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Dexia SA v. Bear Stearns Co., 12-cv-04761.
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yen May Dip to 4 1/2-Year Low, JPMorgan Says: Technical Analysis</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The yen may decline to its weakest
            level against the dollar in more than four and a half years
            after breaking a key level of support, according to JPMorgan
            Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Japanese currency will face a test at 103.50 per dollar
            after breaching the 103-to-103.10 area on May 17, according to
            Niall O'Connor, a technical analyst at JPMorgan in New York. If
            the yen declines past that support level, it may target 105.50,
            the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the currency's 2007
            high, O'Connor said. That would be its weakest level since
            October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It could pause a little bit near-term, but the bottom
            line is that the dollar-yen breakout is still holding,'
            O'Connor said in a telephone interview. 'The jury is still out
            on the 103 level, but the overall upside bias is still intact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen increased 0.9 percent to 102.28 per dollar at 2:23
            p.m. in New York after reaching 101.97. The currency gained 0.5
            percent to 131.85 per euro. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
            of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
            security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
            area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
            is an area where there may be buy orders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
            mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
            on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
            after reaching a new high or low. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Earnings Drag for Major Emerging Stock Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks face
            fundamental headwinds as 2013 earnings revisions for most major
            'country sectors' are negative and growth in the four biggest
            economies is disappointing, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We remain concerned that earnings-per-share forecasts
            will continue to fall,' Adrian Mowat, Hong Kong-based chief
            Asia and emerging-market strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a
            report dated May 18. While growth in gross domestic product is
            'low,' earnings per share are estimated to rise 16 percent
            this year after falling 4 percent in 2012, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The year-to-date performance for emerging equities relative
            to the U.S. is the worst since 1995 and the worst on record
            against the world, Mowat said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 0.2 percent at 12:30
            p.m. in London, trimming this year's decline to 0.7 percent.
            MSCI BRIC Index of equities from Brazil, Russia, India and China
            has dropped 1.1 percent this year. That compares with a 13
            percent increase in the MSCI World Index of developed-country
            stocks and 17 percent jump in the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has an underweight allocation for Russia, China,
            South Africa, Korea, Taiwan and Colombia, a recommendation to
            hold less than benchmark indexes. It's overweight Turkey, India,
            Mexico, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the
            Philippines and Peru, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Barclays Boost Forecasts on Junk-Bond Returns for 2013</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc
            are lifting their forecasts for U.S. junk-bond returns as this
            year's rally exceeds the expectations of top-rated credit
            strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays analysts predict high-yield bonds may gain 8
            percent in 2013, as much as four percentage points more than
            their original expectation, wrote strategists led by Jeffrey Meli and Bradley Rogoff in a May 17 report.
            JPMorgan sees
            'modest upside risk to our original full-year return forecast
            of 7 to 8 percent for U.S. high yield' and now expects gains of
            as much as 10 percent, according to strategists led by Jan
            Loeys. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade bonds have posted average annual returns
            of 21 percent since 2008 as the Federal Reserve pumped more than
            $2.5 trillion into the financial system to galvanize economic
            growth. Junk notes have gained 5.3 percent this year, almost the
            same as in the similar period of 2012, according to Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch index data, and exceeding the 3.1 percent
            full-year 2013 prediction in December by Morgan Stanley (MS)
            strategists led by Adam Richmond. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Junk debt's 'value is still higher than fixed-income
            alternatives given low defaults and volatility,' wrote JPMorgan
            strategists in a May 17 global asset allocation report. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon prepares for a vote tomorrow on whether he should keep
            his chairman and chief executive officer titles, he may take comfort knowing most of his biggest
            shareholders are led by men with the same dual role. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seven of JPMorgan's 10 largest
            owners -- including top five BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Vanguard Group Inc., State Street Corp. (STT), Wellington
            Management Co. and FMR LLC -- are run by CEOs who are also chairmen. The top 10 hold a combined 29.5 percent
            of New York-based JPMorgan's stock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People just like
            him are going to vote on this,' said Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan
            in Ann Arbor. 'If you've told your own board that the best structure for the sake of the company is to
            combine the roles, then how do you turn around and say, 'But that's not true for JPMorgan?'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of
            JPMorgan's top 10 shareholders, only Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price, the seventh-biggest with a 2.15 percent
            stake, has commented publicly on Dimon's role. Brian Rogers -- T. Rowe Price's chairman and chief investment
            officer, and not the CEO - - said in a May 16 statement that 'I fully support the combined chairman and CEO
            role at JPMorgan under the superb leadership of Jamie Dimon.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) plans to invest
            $100 million to revitalize Detroit, the Detroit News reported,
            citing three people with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest investment bank by revenue, plans to
            back firms that promise to provide jobs and invest in the city,
            which is going through the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy,
            the newspaper reported today. The investment, over five years,
            will include loans and grants, the Detroit Free Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move follows as much as $15 million in loans to Detroit
            small businesses by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), and signals Wall
            Street's rising interest in Michigan's largest city, which faces
            $18 billion in long-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman of New York-based JPMorgan, is
            expected to meet with Mayor Mike Duggan, a representative of
            Republican Governor Rick Snyder's office, and possibly
            billionaire Warren Buffett before the plan is detailed on NBC's
            'Today Show' tomorrow, according to the Detroit News. Dimon
            discussed the plan with Snyder in April in New York, the
            newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's program would provide guidance and services
            including consulting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duggan and Steve O'Halloran, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined
            to comment on the report. Buffett didn't immediately respond to
            a request for comment sent to an assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in November that the New
            York-based bank would make loans to small businesses in the
            Detroit area and provide education and other assistance as part
            of its 10,000 Small Businesses initiative with Buffett. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Investcorp Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment firm, hired JPMorgan Chase Co. to sell
            Spanish ceramics-products maker Esmalglass SA, according to
            people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

            company at about 800 million euros ($1.1 billion), the people
            said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private.
            Esmalglass wants to reach an agreement before year-end, they
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investcorp's preferred option is a sale to a private-equity
            firm or another manufacturer, the people said. An initial public
            offering of Esmalglass is still a possibility, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investcorp agreed to buy a majority stake in Esmalglass
            from 3i Group Plc (III) in August 2012 in a deal valued at about 200
            million euros, the people said. Debt provider Intermediate
            Capital Group Plc also took a minority equity stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Esmalglass, which was founded in 1978, employs about 1,000
            people in eight countries, according to the company's website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to HSBC Accused by EU Over Rate-Rigging Cartel</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings
            Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) were accused today by the European
            Union's antitrust arm of colluding to manipulate interbank
            lending rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trio received antitrust complaints alleging they
            participated in a cartel to rig Euribor. The so-called statement
            of objections is the next step in the EU enforcement process
            after the lenders dropped out of settlement talks last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission 'has concerns that the three banks
            may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at
            distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro
            interest rate derivatives,' it said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While six financial firms, including Societe Generale SA (GLE),
            agreed in December to a combined record of 1.7 billion euros
            ($2.3 billion) in fines in the Euribor case and a similar yen
            Libor probe, the regulator's attempt to get a clean sweep of
            settlements was ruined by the dropouts. The EU's case was
            further undermined when Societe Generale appealed its penalty in
            the courts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC fell 1 percent in London trading as of 1:04 p.m. while
            Credit Agricole slipped 0.5 percent in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Without Merit' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and HSBC said in separate statements that they
            would defend themselves against the EU allegations. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Bank Cut by JPMorgan on Concern Over Capital</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), continental
            Europe's biggest bank, was cut to neutral from overweight by
            JPMorgan Chase Co., which said tighter regulation threatens
            capital levels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's proposed
            revision to a securitization framework governing riskier assets
            would reduce Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank's common equity Tier
            1 capital ratio under Basel III rules to as little as 8.6
            percent in 2014 from 10.2 percent, JPMorgan analysts including
            Kian Abouhossein said in a report to clients from London today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reversing an increase to Deutsche Bank's rating three weeks
            ago, JPMorgan said a 3 billion-euro ($3.9 billion) capital
            increase on April 30 'was clearly a defensive move' to offset
            the impact of 'potential capital 'curve balls' such as Basel
            securitization proposals.' Regulators may publish the final
            rules next year, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank fell as much as 3.6 percent to 36.16 euros in
            Frankfurt trading, heading for the biggest drop in a month. The
            stock will trade at 'a high implied risk premium' compared
            with other European banks, rising to 38 euros by December, the
            analysts said. JPMorgan prefers Barclays Plc (BARC), they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rules' Impact &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are overhauling capital rules after widespread
            securitization, or repackaged assets that are sliced up and sold
            on to clients, in the U.S. mortgage market contributed to the
            financial crisis by spreading risk from lenders to the so-called
            shadow-banking industry. Banks have written to the Basel
            committee to say the plans, which will force them to hold more
            reserves against such products, will tie up capital and starve
            the economy of credit. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Top Director Says 'Stay Tuned' on Risk Panel Change</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s risk committee
            could undergo changes in its membership, said Lee R. Raymond,
            the bank's lead director. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In terms of the composition of the risk committee, you
            should stay tuned,' Raymond said today at the firm's annual
            meeting in Tampa, Florida. He was responding to a question from
            Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., on why the board didn't
            overhaul the committee following last year's risk-management
            failures in the chief investment office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shareholders are scheduled to vote on three members of the
            risk committee, including Ellen Futter, 63, David Cote, 60, and
            James Crown, 59. Futter, president of the American Museum of
            Natural History in New York, wasn't able to attend the
            shareholder meeting, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A majority of preliminary ballots supported the three risk-committee members, according to the New
            York Times. Among them,
            Futter received the least support, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futter didn't immediately respond to phone and e-mail
            messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Shareholders Reject CEO-Chairman Split in Win for Dimon</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon won shareholder support to remain chairman,
            surviving a campaign to split the roles after a record trading
            loss at the biggest U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposal to divide Dimon's duties won 32.2 percent of
            the votes, down from 40 percent last year, the bank said today
            at its annual meeting in Tampa, Florida. Dimon, 57, had told
            some investors he might quit if the non-binding measure passed,
            according to a person with knowledge of the conversation, who
            requested anonymity because the discussion was private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The vote to back Dimon, who guided JPMorgan to three
            straight years of record profit, is a defeat for investors who
            say companies need the balance of a separate chairman and CEO.
            While Dimon can keep both jobs, the vote may spur JPMorgan's
            directors to tighten how they oversee the company after
            last year's $6.2 billion 'London Whale' trading loss and
            identify a future successor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'JPMorgan changes after this annual meeting season, even
            if all the votes go in the direction' JPMorgan wanted, Michael Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd., told Bloomberg
            Television's Erik
            Schatzker in Tampa today. The bank could give more authority to
            lead director Lee R. Raymond, the former chairman and CEO of
            Exxon Mobil Corp., or split Dimon's roles after he leaves, a
            person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley Squares Off Against JPMorgan on Baht</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Depending on whether you listen to
            Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan Chase Co., the imposition of
            martial law in Thailand will either send the baht tumbling to
            levels last seen in 2006 or put an end to its losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley yesterday reiterated its prediction that the
            baht will weaken 12 percent by year-end to 37 per dollar as the
            political crisis pushes the country toward a recession. JPMorgan
            was more optimistic, confirming an overweight recommendation on
            the currency, amid bets the army's move will help end months of
            street protests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The disparity of opinion on the outlook for the currency
            mirrors the mixed signals coming from Thailand's economy. While
            an official report this week showed gross domestic product
            shrank in the first quarter, the nation has the biggest
            cumulative trade surplus for more than three years, and exports
            are rising. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market tends to be complacent about Thai politics,
            it's not the first coup,' Paul McNamara, a London-based
            investment director at GAM U.K. Ltd., which manages $129 billion
            in assets, said yesterday by e-mail. 'It's not just noise, the
            chances of something terrible happening are rising. But until we
            see convincing spill-over to the real economy, I think the
            fallout will be limited.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Paring Decline &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The baht is the only one of 12 Asian currencies tracked by
            Bloomberg to drop versus the dollar this month, slipping 0.4
            percent. It has retreated 4.3 percent since the anti-government
            protests started at the end of October, the worst performance in
            the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currency fell as much as 0.6 percent yesterday to
            32.660 per dollar, before paring its retreat amid speculation of
            intervention by the central bank. It climbed 0.1 percent today
            to 32.493 as of 1:06 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our target of 37 is very achievable,' Geoffrey Kendrick,
            Morgan Stanley's head of Asia currency and interest-rate
            strategy in Hong Kong, said yesterday in a phone interview.
            'The economy is in a massive hole. Thailand is certainly going
            to have a technical recession in the first half.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thailand's army chief declared martial law yesterday,
            telling local television that the move wasn't a coup and would
            help end the street protests that led to Yingluck Shinawatra's
            removal as prime minister this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The violence has driven away tourists and hurt the economy,
            with a May 19 report showing GDP shrank 2.1 percent in the first
            quarter, after growing a revised 0.1 percent in the previous
            three-month period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Airport Shutdown &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thailand's last quarter-on-quarter recession was in 2009,
            when anti-government protesters shut down Bangkok's main
            international airport for more than a week at the height of the
            global financial meltdown. The baht tumbled 17 percent against
            the dollar in the five quarters ending March 2009, the sharpest
            decline since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money poured out of the country yesterday. Overseas
            investors sold $256 million more Thai shares than they bought,
            the heaviest net sales since November, and pulled $61 million
            from bonds, exchange data show. Global funds have withdrawn
            about $1 billion from local debt and equities in May, snapping
            two months of inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Others are optimistic about the baht's prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm not worried about the baht, I'm looking for levels to
            buy,' Rajeev De Mello, who manages $10 billion as the head of
            Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., said
            by phone yesterday from Singapore. 'The main support of the
            baht in the past has really been the trade side. On the investor
            side, the people who wanted to get out of Thailand have already
            gotten out.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Baht Appreciation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Westpac Banking Corp., Australia's second-biggest lender by
            market value, expects the baht to strengthen about 3 percent by
            year-end to 31.4 per dollar. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
            survey of 24 strategists is for a decline to 33. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Foreigners are excessively underweight baht assets, and
            covering this positioning on any reduction of political risk
            would trigger baht appreciation,' Daniel Hui, the head of
            emerging-Asia currency strategy at JPMorgan in Singapore, wrote
            yesterday in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday marked the army's most direct involvement in
            Thailand's politics since 2006, when then-premier Thaksin
            Shinawatra, Yingluck's brother, was removed in a coup. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Surviving Coups &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thailand has had 11 coups since direct rule by kings ended
            in 1932, and the currency has ridden out most of them. Martial
            law was last invoked in April 2010, and a month later the baht
            had risen 0.3 percent against the dollar, the best performance
            in Asia. It was little changed in September 2006, when Thaksin
            was ousted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country has been without a fully functioning government
            since December, when Yingluck called snap elections in a bid to
            ease the unrest. To Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
            that will lead to a drop in the baht of about 4 percent this
            year to 34 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Politics definitely is the biggest risk at present, and
            there are negative effects on the economy,' Khoon Goh, a
            Singapore-based senior strategist at ANZ, said in a May 19 phone
            interview. 'We've already seen portfolio outflows. The risk is
            that foreign-direct investment slows down sharply if investor
            concern over the political situation intensifies.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Invest $100 Million in Detroit Revival Over 5 Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is investing
            $100 million over five years to revive bankrupt Detroit, marking
            the bank's largest commitment to a city. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will provide funds for community development,
            blight removal, job training, small-business support and other
            growth programs, the biggest investment bank by revenue said
            today in a statement. The move follows as much as $15 million in
            loans to Detroit small businesses announced by Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) in November, and signals Wall Street's rising
            interest in the erstwhile auto-manufacturing capital, which
            faces $18 billion in long-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe in Detroit's future, and we want to see the
            city recover its economic strength,' Jamie Dimon, chairman of
            New York-based JPMorgan, said in the statement before a luncheon
            with community and government leaders in Detroit today. 'With
            this investment, we are putting our resources and expertise to
            work to help Detroit chart a course back to economic
            prosperity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank's commitment includes $40 million
            in flexible, long-term debt capital and $10 million in grant
            capital to two community-development lenders. Another $25
            million will help end residential blight and restore properties,
            and $12.5 million will go toward work-force training and
            development. The investment also offers $7 million to support
            small businesses and $5.5 million in strategic initiatives,
            including investing in a new rail line. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Seen Waiting on Board Changes After 'Stay Tuned' Remark</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s board, whose
            top director told investors yesterday to 'stay tuned' for
            changes to its risk committee, isn't likely to add new members
            immediately, according to two people with knowledge of the
            board's thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board isn't seeking to replace current members and may
            take months to make any additions, the people said, asking not
            to be named because the talks are private. Lead director Lee R. Raymond, 74, wants to strengthen the New
            York-based firm's board
            by adding executives with more experience in finance and
            accounting after some shareholder groups opposed re-electing as
            many as six risk- and audit-committee members, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 11-member board doesn't see a need to rush additions to
            those two panels after shareholders voted yesterday in favor of
            every member and increased support for Jamie Dimon's dual roles
            as chairman and chief executive officer, the people said. Three
            of the risk committee's four members received less than 60
            percent support from shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In terms of the composition of the risk committee, you
            should stay tuned,' Raymond told investors yesterday at the
            annual investor meeting in Tampa, Florida, shortly before the
            preliminary voting results were made public. Kristin Lemkau, a

            plans. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UBS Hires Brizay From JPMorgan as Head of M&amp;amp;A in EMEA</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) hired Severin Brizay from
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to oversee its mergers and acquisitions
            team in Europe, the Middle East and Africa as Switzerland's
            largest bank overhauls management of the business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brizay spent 14 years working on deals at JPMorgan from
            London and Paris, according to an employee memo obtained by
            Bloomberg News. His hire follows James Hartop's decision to work
            directly with clients and step back from management after three
            years leading coverage and advisory in corporate-client
            solutions in the region, according to the memo written by
            William Vereker, head of corporate-client solutions in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brizay will report to Vereker and build the deals business
            in the region, working closely with the bank's global head of
            MA, Piero Novelli, according to the memo. Its contents were
            confirmed by a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS also hired Glenn Rewick from Bank of America Corp. as a
            managing director in EMEA advisory focusing on health-care
            deals, according to the memo. Juan Monte will become head of
            country coverage, managing teams for Continental Europe and for
            Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa while
            continuing to head corporate-client solutions in Spain. Diego Pignatelli will continue in his role as
            chairman of coverage and
            advisory. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Rowley will become chairman of UBS's global
            business-review group process while continuing as a senior MA
            banker and chairman of the EMEA business-review group and the
            EMEA fairness-opinion committee, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Finra Fines Cost JPMorgan 3 Minutes of Profit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest bond dealers,
            including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley, failed to
            properly report trades to the industry's price-tracking system
            more than 11,000 times. JPMorgan's penalty: About three minutes
            of its annual profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fines levied in settlements disclosed last month by the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority amounted to a fraction
            of what the two New York-based firms generated from trading debt
            during the two-year reviews. JPMorgan's $95,000 penalty was the
            biggest imposed by Finra as it cited at least three other
            dealers in the past five months for similar types of violations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are seeking to uphold the integrity of the bond-price reporting system known as Trace,
            the biggest window into a
            market that's grown about 78 percent since 2008 as investors
            poured money into debt securities. Holding back information on
            trades can give Wall Street dealers an advantage over customers
            seeking a fair price, undermining Finra's stated goal of equal
            access for all participants to real-time data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If non-reporting is systemic, then that's concerning
            because the broader market looks to this data as the golden
            source,' said Kevin McPartland, head of market-structure
            research at consulting firm Greenwich Associates. 'It's the
            best we've got when people try to understand who is doing what
            in the bond market.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Sell Bonds Backed by $443 Million of Mortgages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co. is planning its
            second sale of U.S. home-loan securities without government
            backing since the financial crisis the debt helped to trigger. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds will be backed by $443 million of 'high-quality' so-called jumbo mortgages, according to
            statements e-mailed today by Kroll Bond Rating Agency and DBRS Ltd., which
            expect to grant top grades to most of the notes. Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
            immediately
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, like a $616.3 million transaction in March by the
            New York-based bank, contains relatively weak contractual
            promises that lenders or the issuer will repurchase loans that
            fail to match their promised quality, DBRS said. Sellers have
            begun taking different approaches to those terms as issuance in
            the so-called non-agency mortgage-bond market revives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, 'the representations and warranties framework in
            this transaction does show some improvements' from JPMorgan's
            last deal, including how fraud is defined, DBRS analysts
            including Claire J. Mezzanotte and Quincy Tang said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DBRS and Kroll said that they took the weaker provisions
            into account in assigning grades to the securities. Fitch
            Ratings, which will also rate most of the notes, said in a
            report that it was not asked to rank a $13.7 million slice
            granted AAA ratings by those two firms. The risk of
            the debt means it deserves an AA grade, two levels lower, Fitch
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Slow Acceleration &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance of non-agency bonds has been tied to about $6
            billion of new loans this year, increasing from about $3.5
            billion in all of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Barclays Plc analysts said in a May 21 report that the expansion
            will be slow to accelerate and maintained a 2013 forecast of $12
            billion to $15 billion. Sales peaked at about $1.2 trillion in
            each of 2005 and 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The relative yields buyers demand on the bonds have been
            widening as issuance increases and amid investor concern that
            government-backed housing debt offered better value and that the
            mortgages will prepay slower than expected if interest rates
            rise or faster if they fall. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A May 17 offering by Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT) included $299
            million of top-rated bonds that priced to yield 2.82 percent, or
            1.90 percentage points more than benchmark swap rates. That
            compared with spreads of 1.75 percentage points on similar
            securities sold last month by the Mill Valley, California-based
            firm and as low as 0.97 percentage point in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jumbo home loans are larger than allowed in government-supported programs, currently as much as
            $729,750 for single-family properties in high-cost areas. For Fannie Mae and Freddie
            Mac loans with the lowest costs for borrowers using 20 percent
            down payments, limits range from $417,000 to $625,500. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. markets regulator fined a
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit 3 million pounds ($4.5 million) for
            failing to keep up-to-date records of clients and lacking risk
            and compliance controls. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senior management at JPMorgan International Bank didn't
            have 'sufficient information and oversight tools' to correct
            the problem in its wealth management business for two years, the
            London-based Financial Conduct Authority said in an e-mailed
            statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Customers of wealth managers should be able to expect the
            firm to keep complete, up-to-date client records so that they
            can give the right advice,' Tracey McDermott, director of
            enforcement and financial crime at the FCA, said. 'In this case
            the firm did not have complete records, nor did its management
            have the information they needed to recognize this. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator said that the bank's computer-based record
            system didn't hold sufficient information and that its
            suitability reports didn't have adequate statements about client
            needs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have fully cooperated with the FCA and have enhanced
            our procedures to ensure that they are compliant with regulatory
            requirements,' the bank said in an e-mailed statement. 'As the
            FCA has noted in its press release, there has been no detriment
            to customers identified to date.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Is Hired by Russia to Promote Sovereign Credit Rating</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's Finance Ministry hired
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) the biggest U.S. lender, to help boost the
            country's standing among credit-rating companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was chosen after beating proposals from other
            investment banks, the ministry said in a statement on its
            website, without naming the other firms. Natalia Shchetinina, a
            JPMorgan spokeswoman in Moscow, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia has long complained of bias by the three U.S. rating
            companies that dominate the industry. President Vladimir Putin
            said in 2011 the rankings given to Russia were an 'outrage'
            that increased borrowing costs for domestic companies and the
            government. The country has 'more than earned' an upgrade,
            Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy exporter last had its debt score
            changed by one of the three U.S. companies in February 2009,
            when Fitch Ratings cut it one level to BBB, three steps below A
            and two above junk. That came three months after Standard
            Poor's did the same. Moody's Investors Service has held Russia
            at Baa1, the third-lowest investment grade, since July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP and Moody's have said Russia's reliance on oil revenue,
            which makes the budget vulnerable to swings in commodity prices,
            outweighs the low level of sovereign debt. Russia plans to
            follow last year's sale of $7 billion in euro bonds with another
            offering of the same amount in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in February it had been hired
            by the government to burnish Russia's image overseas and attract
            institutional investors. The New York-based bank signed a three-year agreement with the Economy Ministry and
            the Russian Direct
            Investment Fund to advise on issues such as communicating
            government decisions and setting up meetings with investors,
            according to Sergei Arsenyev, Goldman Sachs's managing director
            of investment banking in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and New York-based JPMorgan are on a list of
            23 foreign and domestic banks selected to advise Russia on its 1
            trillion-ruble ($33 billion) privatization program. Last year
            both American investment banks helped advise OAO Sberbank,
            Russia's largest lender, on a $5.2 billion equity sale. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>StanChart, JPMorgan, NCB Capital to Manage Saudi Telecom Sukuk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) hired Standard
            Chartered Plc, JPMorgan Chase Co. and NCB Capital to market
            its debut Islamic bond as companies in the oil-rich kingdom
            increasingly tap the debt market for funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will manage the potential sale under a 5-billion
            riyal ($1.3 billion) sukuk program, Saudi Telecom said in a
            statement today. The size of the private local placement will
            depend on market conditions, it said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabian companies are diversifying their financing
            sources as the Arab world's biggest economy spends billions of
            dollars to develop infrastructure. Banque Saudi Fransi, the
            lender part owned by Credit Agricole SA, is planning to raise
            about 2 billion riyals to bolster its capital base, while Saudi
            airliner Flynas is considering a sukuk sale to fund its
            expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While riyal-denominated local private placements have been
            the preferred option for many companies, others have started to
            venture into sales abroad. Saudi Electricity Co., (SECO) the state-owned utility, last month raised $2.5
            billion from sale of two-part sukuk to international investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Telecom's sukuk plan comes after Mohammad Al
            Kharashi, the governor of the state-run Public Pension Agency,
            earlier this month said he welcomed more sukuk offerings. The
            power utility, majority owned by the government, reported a 54
            percent increase in first-quarter profit. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Pinto Says Clients Cautious After Trades Went Wrong</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the world's
            biggest investment bank by revenue, said a pair of wrong-way
            bets made by clients at the start of the year is partly to blame
            for Wall Street's trading slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest wagers included shorting Japan's
            currency and betting that U.S. interest rates would rise more
            steeply than those in Europe, according to Daniel Pinto, head of
            the New York-based firm's corporate and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Neither of those trades paid,' Pinto, 51, said today at
            an investor conference in New York. 'Essentially you start the
            year with the wrong momentum, where you lose money at the very
            beginning, and you ended up with probably a lower risk appetite
            than you would have otherwise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan warned investors earlier this month that second-quarter markets revenue will probably drop
            about 20 percent from
            a year earlier, after a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income,
            currencies and commodities trading in the first quarter. That
            would amount to JPMorgan's worst first half for trading since
            the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another reason for the lackluster results is reduced
            volatility, which has dropped to the lowest in 10 to 15 years
            for rates, currencies and credit trading, Pinto said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When 'the market doesn't move, it's really difficult to
            monetize your flows,' Pinto said. 'It makes the market more
            competitive and margins really tighten because it costs you very
            little to provide liquidity, so you provide a lot.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Episodic Trades &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clients appear to be hesitating in placing the larger
            hedges that typically happen earlier in the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have episodic trades, big hedges, big corporate
            trades, that happen along the year,' Pinto said. 'Particularly
            in the first and part of the second, the amount of those trades,
            even though the pipeline is very healthy, they haven't happened.
            It looks like they are going to happen later in the year, and
            that is a big swing factor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The industry's shrinking results are being caused more by
            low volatility and monetary policy than by new regulations, he
            said, adding that investment banks may have to wait until 2016
            before revenue improves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Probably we will have a flattish year next year, and then
            probably with all that we talked about before -- markets will
            grow, normalization of interest rates -- all that will sort of
            bring revenues up again,' Pinto said. 'It's probably a bit
            more down the line.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Saudi Banks Beating JPMorgan Urged to Boost Capital: Arab Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is urging lenders to
            boost capital reserves, which are already above those of global
            peers including JPMorgan Chase Co. and Citigroup Inc, to
            support lending growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lending in the oil-rich country is expected to increase
            more than 10 percent a year until 2017, according to Arqaam
            Capital Ltd. National Commercial Bank this year raised $1.3
            billion through bonds, making it the strongest start to a year
            for bank issuance since 2007, as Central Bank Governor Fahad Al Mubarak seeks higher capital ratios. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency continues to encourage
            Saudi banks to build up higher levels of capital adequacy,' Al
            Mubarak said May 21 in response to e-mailed questions. 'Banks
            should anticipate that current and future economic growth will
            lead to increased credit demand.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The kingdom's economy is expanding about four times faster
            than the euro area as the government spends $130 billion to
            build new homes and boost the non-oil economy. Banque Saudi
            Fransi is planning to raise about 2 billion riyals ($533
            million) to bolster Tier 2 capital, used to cushion against
            future losses, two people familiar with the matter said May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Well Capitalized' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi British Bank, part-owned by HSBC Holdings Plc, and
            Saudi Hollandi Bank have also sold Islamic bonds in the past six
            months, taking advantage of lower funding costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average yield on Middle East sukuk declined 53 basis
            points this year to 4.11 percent, the lowest since June,
            according to JPMorgan Chase Co. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some banks 'will raise more capital this year to fully
            comply with new regulatory requirements,' Jamal Al Kishi, chief
            executive officer of Deutsche Bank Securities Saudi Arabia, said
            yesterday. 'Broadly speaking, banks in Saudi Arabia are well
            capitalized.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jeddah-based Bank Al Jazira had a capital ratio of 15
            percent at the end of 2013, the lowest of the 11 publicly traded
            banks in the kingdom, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            That was still higher than JPMorgan Chase's at 14.5 percent and
            Citigroup Inc. (C)'s at 12.3 percent at the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is following Sweden, which already imposes
            some of the world's strictest bank standards. The Swedish
            Financial Services Authority will raise capital requirements
            further in order to protect taxpayers from future financial
            crises, it said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'SAMA always prefers more capital and is a strong
            proponent of countercyclical measures,' David Dew, managing
            director at Saudi British Bank, said in an interview in Riyadh
            on May 5. 'Saudi banks are among the strongest in the world.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yen Contrarian JPMorgan Joins Consensus Victorious: Currencies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., whose
            contrarian call late last year that the yen would rally in the
            first half of 2014 has proved prescient, is sticking with its
            forecast for a second-half rout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tohru Sasaki, the company's Tokyo-based head of Japan rates
            and currency research, said he senses Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's structural reforms, which include
            corporate tax cuts, will
            bear fruit. That's the last of the so-called three arrows of
            Abe's road map for breaking the economy free from persistent
            deflation and slow growth. The first two are fiscal stimulus and
            record monetary easing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Global investors are obviously very disappointed in
            Abenomics right now, but the third arrow is still moving
            forward,' Sasaki, 46, said by phone on May 23. 'If the
            Japanese economy is getting stronger, then Japanese investors
            become more confident in the future and take more risks, and
            invest more in foreign assets,' weakening the yen, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Betting on a lower yen has been one of the biggest losing
            trades in global markets this year, along with calls for higher
            bond yields, as the global economy failed to strengthen as much
            as forecast and geopolitical events including Ukraine's conflict
            with Russia flared. The yen -- a haven in times of crisis --
            gained 3.1 percent against 10 developed-nation peers tracked by
            Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes this year, while the
            dollar and euro have fallen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Third Arrow &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen failed to extend its almost 17 percent slide last
            year versus the basket as the Bank of Japan refrained from
            printing more money to expand 70 trillion yen ($687 billion) of
            annual asset purchases and as the impact of government spending
            waned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abe has also been perceived as slow to reveal his
            structural reforms. The nation's economy will probably expand
            1.35 percent this year, compared with 2.5 percent in the U.S.,
            surveys by Bloomberg show. The Wall Street Journal quoted BOJ
            Governor Haruhiko Kuroda as saying there are limits to the
            central bank's ability to spur growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has been considerable disappointment in the third
            arrow,' Steven Englander, the New York-based global head of
            Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy at Citigroup Inc., wrote
            in a note to clients on May 23. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fell 0.2 percent today to 102.11 per dollar at 12:27
            p.m. in New York, compared with this year's weakest level of
            105.44 on Jan. 2. In December, when the median estimate of
            analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for the currency to
            depreciate to 104 by the end of June, Sasaki said it would
            actually reach 100. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Easing Expectations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sasaki, a former central-bank official, now expects the
            currency to finish the year at 106, similar to his forecast in
            December and a level unseen since October 2008. Analysts in the
            latest Bloomberg survey see it dropping to 107 by Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's still a chance the yen will extend gains in coming
            weeks, according to Sasaki. While 44 percent of 32 economists
            surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the BOJ will add to stimulus in
            July, including those at JPMorgan, Sasaki said that will have
            little power to weaken the currency. Instead, he sees potential
            for a lack of action to boost the yen to 97. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Whatever comes from the BOJ will not be as powerful as
            last year, so markets will probably be disappointed, and will be
            forced to unwind yen short positions,' said Sasaki, who worked
            at the central bank from 1992 to 2003. 'Even if the BOJ does
            something in July, it's already priced in.' A short position is
            a bet an asset will decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Abe's Ninja &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
            other large speculators on a drop in the yen versus the dollar
            compared with those on a gain -- known as net shorts -- fell to
            53,787 on May 20, the least since November 2012, figures from
            the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
            The net shorts reached 143,822 on Dec. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The BOJ has been buying about 7 trillion yen of sovereign
            debt a month since Kuroda started the so-called quantitative and
            qualitative easing program in April last year, and refrained
            from adding stimulus in a meeting on May 21. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sasaki expects Abe to make progress on structural reforms,
            such as a proposed corporate tax cut and relaxing regulations
            for business, that he says will, over time, boost corporate
            profits and improve investors' risk appetite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The first and second arrows were big injections of pain
            killer but the third arrow is like acupuncture, with many small
            needles,' Sasaki said. 'It takes time and it's hard to see the
            effects but eventually it improves your health.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's a view shared by Societe Generale SA, which sees the
            yen weakening to 110 per dollar in a year as Abe's changes take
            hold and the Federal Reserve reduces stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The third arrow is like a ninja -- you cannot see it but
            it's there,' Takuji Aida, the French bank's chief economist in
            Tokyo, said in phone interview today. 'The growth strategy is
            something you will feel the impact of very gradually, over a
            long period of time.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Precious Metals Using ETPs Seen by JPMorgan Returning 30%</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Trading precious metals against each
            other based on purchases and sales through exchange-traded
            products would have returned an annual profit of about 30
            percent since 2007, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank rates investment in the products on a weekly
            basis, buying the metal with the highest current holding
            relative to the past six months and selling the one with the
            lowest relative holding. The strategy, which was first
            calculated this month, would have been successful about 56
            percent of the time since 2007, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold entered a bear market in April and sales from ETPs
            since the start of January surpassed what was amassed in the
            combined previous two years as some investors lost faith in a
            store of value amid an improving U.S. economy and rally in
            equities. While the four precious metals would have on average
            been bought and sold equally as much each other since 2007,
            JPMorgan's strategy suggested selling gold since January and
            buying platinum since the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a decent success rate,' Matthew Lehmann, a global
            strategist at JPMorgan's asset allocation team in London, said
            in a phone interview last week. 'Even that tiny margin over
            time gives you a huge advantage cumulatively against the market.
            What makes this strategy interesting is that the flows appear to
            work better on a relative basis. Having four metals so that
            you're not always exposed to one helps as well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gold Price &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are now selling gold after holdings rose every
            year since the first product was listed in 2003, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. Bullion for immediate delivery slipped 18
            percent this year to $1,378.75 an ounce in London, valuing the
            amount held through the products at $95.7 billion. About 50
            percent of metal in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest gold ETP,
            is owned by institutional investors, with the rest held by
            retail investors, Deutsche Bank AG said in a May 14 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold ETP holdings slipped 473.5 metric tons this year,
            equal to about two months of mine production. At least another
            435 tons may be sold if the Federal Reserve curbs stimulus
            before the end of the year, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a May
            22 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 18 percent drop in gold holdings this year compares
            with gains of 0.2 percent for silver, 16 percent for palladium
            and 34 percent for platinum. Silver prices plunged 27 percent to
            $22.2571 an ounce this year, the worst performance in the
            Standard Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 commodities. Platinum is down
            5.9 percent at $1,448.48 an ounce and palladium rose 3.9 percent
            to $731.43 an ounce. Platinum and palladium are mostly used in
            car autocatalysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETP Flows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've looked at ETP flows and what's happening in gold
            and found that they're not always that correlated,' Lehmann
            said. 'That's most noticeably been the case over the last two
            or three years, where there's been periods where gold sold off
            but the ETP holdings kept rising.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the International Monetary Fund lowered its 2013
            global growth outlook four times since July, it expects
            expansion to accelerate to 4 percent in 2014 from 3.3 percent
            this year. Industrial applications account for about 10 percent
            of gold consumption, compared with 60 percent for platinum and
            91 percent for palladium, data from the World Gold Council and
            Johnson Matthey Plc, both based in London, show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) hired Travis Machen from Morgan Stanley to run corporate banking for hedge
            funds, money managers and other mid-sized financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Machen, 37, was co-head of Morgan Stanley's North American
            banks group in the investment-bank division, New York-based
            JPMorgan said today in a statement. He'll be in charge of
            JPMorgan's financial institutions group within its commercial
            bank, which serves clients with $50 million to $25 billion in
            assets, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Machen's experience will be 'essential to effectively
            address the rapidly changing regulatory environment that
            continues to affect this industry,' Rob Holmes, head of
            JPMorgan corporate client banking, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Brazil Rate Hold Call Challenged by Top Forecaster</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's top economic forecaster is
            challenging calls from banks such as JPMorgan Chase Co. and
            Deutsche Bank that policy makers will end the world's longest
            tightening cycle, saying faster inflation will motivate them to
            boost interest rates for a 10th straight meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fernando Fix, chief economist at Votorantim Asset
            Management in Sao Paulo, estimates central bankers will raise
            interest rates by a quarter point to 11.25 percent when the two-day meeting ends today after 6 p.m. local
            time. That puts him at
            odds with the median estimate of 53 analysts surveyed by
            Bloomberg and traders, who say there's an 80 percent chance the
            central bank will hold the benchmark Selic at 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer prices in the world's second-largest emerging
            market have accelerated in the past four months as service costs
            push annual inflation to the highest level in 10 months. Policy
            makers will continue to raise the benchmark Selic rate today as
            faster inflation threatens investment and confidence levels in
            Brazil, Fix said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The central bank recognizes problems related to the
            persistence of inflation,' he said by telephone. 'It's
            becoming clearer that high inflation is counterproductive for
            growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank's press office declined to comment on
            market expectations when contacted by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers have raised the Selic by 3.75 percentage
            points since April 2013 to fight inflation that Fix said is
            still being fanned by falling unemployment rates and rising
            wages. That's the biggest increase of benchmark borrowing costs
            in the past year after Turkey and the longest cycle of monetary
            policy tightening in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Annual inflation accelerated to 6.31 percent in mid-May
            from 6.19 percent the prior month as education, health care and
            housing prices increased. The central bank targets 4.5 percent
            inflation, plus or minus two percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent last month, the lowest
            since January, while average real income grew from last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Industrial production has been weaker, contracting twice in
            the first quarter, as economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
            economic growth will slow this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3
            percent last year. Consumer confidence as measured by the
            Getulio Vargas Foundation in May fell to the lowest level in
            more than five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Disappointing' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent in the first
            quarter, down from 0.7 percent in the previous three months,
            according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The statistics agency
            is scheduled to publish GDP data May 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'disappointing' expansion in some wealthier nations
            is helping reduce inflationary pressures, according to Fabio Akira, chief economist for JPMorgan in Brazil.
            Policy makers
            also are aware that boosting the Selic more will hinder Brazil's
            economic expansion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Activity numbers are weakening,' said Akira. 'We are
            going to see data that will worsen further.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Akira is the best forecaster of Brazil's economic data
            after Fix, according to information compiled by Bloomberg. The
            ranking is based on the accuracy of estimates for key economic
            indicators over the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The local currency appreciation also will help relieve
            inflationary pressures, Akira said. The real has strengthened
            5.6 percent against the dollar this year, the best performance
            among 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It
            depreciated 0.6 percent yesterday to 2.2377 per U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pared Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders have pared bets for further tightening as policy
            makers such as central bank President Alexandre Tombini and the
            institution's international affairs director, Luiz Awazu Pereira, said at separate events this month that
            monetary policy
            has a delayed impact on consumer prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 have
            declined 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 10.91
            percent since the central bank's last meeting. The breakeven
            rate, based on the difference in yields of inflation-linked
            bonds and interest-rate swaps due in 2015, dropped 58 basis
            points over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jose Carlos de Faria, chief Brazil economist for Deutsche
            Bank, agrees with the central bank's assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's clear that we still haven't seen the full effect'
            of rate increases, said Faria. 'The central bank has provided
            signs that it will pause.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Votorantim Asset Management's Fix, policy makers will
            need to increase the Selic by 100 basis points next year to
            prevent consumer price increases from breaching the ceiling of
            the target range. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Inflation is still worrisome,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(The headline of an earlier version of this story was
            corrected to show JPMorgan forecasts no change in the Selic.) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Banker Hannam Loses Appeal of U.K. FCA Fine</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, once a top JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) mining adviser, lost his bid to overturn a market-abuse
            fine from British regulators in a win for the watchdog as it
            attempts to go after senior bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam's messages with a potential client 'were not in the
            proper course of the exercise of his employment,' the court
            said in a ruling published yesterday, upholding the reasoning
            behind a 450,000-pound ($752,000) fine levied by the U.K.
            Financial Conduct Authority two years ago. The amount of the
            penalty will be reviewed separately, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam, global chairman of equity capital markets at the
            time, e-mailed a potential customer in 2008 with details of a
            bid for his client, Heritage Oil Plc, as well as news of an oil
            find. The Financial Conduct Authority, then known as the
            Financial Services Authority, deemed the exchanges insider
            information and fined the banker in April 2012 for market abuse,
            prompting him to step down from his post in JPMorgan's Cazenove
            unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am obviously disappointed that the tribunal has
            rejected the explanation as to why the two e-mails sent in the
            course of advising and assisting my client did not contravene
            the rules,' Hannam, 58, said in an e-mailed statement. 'I was
            indeed acting only in the interests of my client.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The tribunal asked Hannam and the regulator to submit
            arguments on how much the fine should be to determine whether or
            not to change the amount of the penalty, the FCA said in an e-mailed statement today in response to the
            decision. Hannam can
            appeal the court's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Looking Good' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam e-mailed Dr. Ashti Hawrami, the Kurdish Regional
            Government's natural resources minister, in September and
            October 2008 informing him of a potential third party bid for
            Heritage Oil and positive developments in the company's oil
            exploration. The e-mails were sent when Hawrami might have been
            interested in taking a stake in Heritage, qualifying the
            disclosures as inside information, according to the FCA's
            penalty notice from 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I thought I would update you on discussions that have
            been going on with a potential acquirer,' Hannam told Hawrami
            in the September e-mail, according to the judgment. 'I believe
            that the offer will come in in the current difficult market
            conditions at '3.50 - '4.00 per share. I am not trying to force
            your hand, just wanted to make you aware of what is happening.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hannam sent Hawrami another e-mail in October to tell him
            Tony Buckingham, Heritage's chief executive officer, has 'just
            found oil and it is looking good.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It wasn't necessary to disclose the information to Hawrami
            to keep the Kurdish official interested in Heritage, and Hannam
            'gave no consideration to whether he could properly disclose
            the information which he did,' according to the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sberbank Rallying to JPMorgan on Loans: Russia Overnight</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Sberbank (SBRCY), Russia's largest
            lender, will extend this year's rally by a further 26 percent as
            loan growth outweighs concern that profit is falling, according
            to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Sberbank, which slumped today after posting a
            drop in net income, is set for a fourth quarterly gain, the
            longest stretch of advances since March 2010. The stock tumbled
            2.4 percent at 12:50 p.m. in Moscow and 2.7 percent in London,
            after losing 1.6 percent in New York yesterday. The Micex Index
            fell 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Sberbank's net income attributable to shareholders
            slid 3.9 percent to 88.6 billion rubles ($2.8 billion) by
            international accounting standards, that beat the mean estimate
            of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for an 8 percent
            decline. Retail loans increased 6 percent in the first five
            months of the year compared with a year earlier, while corporate
            loans fell 0.1 percent, according to a May 14 financial report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We remain buyers as loan growth may be recovering and
            valuations continue looking compelling,' Alex Kantarovich, the
            head of Russian equity research at JPMorgan in Moscow, who has
            an overweight rating for Sberbank since August and predicts the
            shares will rise to 131.13 rubles by year-end, said by e-mail
            yesterday. 'The size and market share owing to the massive
            footprint remains the main source of the bank's competitive
            advantage.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Chicago-Based Funds Settle Mortgage Bond Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and a Chicago-based group of funds agreed to settle a lawsuit in which the
            funds claimed JPMorgan gave faulty information involving
            residential mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AMF Funds sued JPMorgan in New York State Supreme Court in
            Manhattan in February 2012, accusing the bank of making
            'material representations and omissions' on underwriting
            standards used to make mortgage loans pooled into $515.6 million
            of securities purchased from May 2003 to May 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two sides have reached an agreement in principle to
            settle the suit, according to letters filed by both sides in the
            past week. Watertown Savings Bank, a Massachusetts lender and
            former shareholder of AMF Funds, has asked to intervene in the
            case, which both sides oppose. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AMF Funds, managed by Shay Assets Management Inc., had
            about $590 million in assets under management in 2011, according
            to its website. Mark Arisohn, an attorney with Labaton Sucharow
            LLP representing the funds, and Darrell S. Cafasso, a lawyer
            with Sullivan Cromwell LLP for JPMorgan, didn't immediately
            return telephone calls seeking comment on the letters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
            part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
            biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
            and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
            market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Asset Management Fund v. JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            650320/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Accused by Los Angeles of Discriminatory Lending</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The city of Los Angeles accused
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) of targeting minority borrowers with
            predatory loans in a lawsuit filed two days after Wells Fargo
            Co. (WFC) lost a court bid to dismiss a similar case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. city sued Wells Fargo, Citigroup
            Inc. and Bank of America Corp. last year, saying the lenders
            engaged in biased practices since at least 2004 by placing
            minority borrowers in mortgages they couldn't afford and driving
            up the number of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'L.A. continues to suffer from the foreclosure crisis,
            from blight in our neighborhoods to diminished revenue for basic
            city services,' City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.
            'We're fighting to hold those we allege are responsible to
            account.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The claim against New York-based JPMorgan is the most
            recent in a series of lawsuits by municipalities across the U.S.
            to hold mortgage lenders responsible for fallout from the
            collapse of the housing market. Yesterday, Providence, Rhode
            Island, sued Banco Santander SA (SAN)'s U.S. unit, alleging
            discriminatory lending in the years after the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In today's suit and earlier ones by Los Angeles, the city
            accuses the banks of historically 'red-lining' black and
            Hispanic areas as no-loan zones. Starting in the late 1990s, the
            banks engaged in 'reverse red-lining' by flooding the areas
            with subprime mortgages even when minorities qualified for
            better terms, according to the complaint filed today in federal
            court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fair Terms' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition, JPMorgan has since 2009 declined to offer
            refinancing or loan modification to minority customers on 'fair
            terms,' according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are disappointed the L.A. city attorney is pursuing an
            adversarial approach to address city finances impacted by the
            recent economic downturn,' JPMorgan spokeswoman Suzanne Ryan
            said in an e-mailed statement. 'The downturn was beyond our
            control.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Counties encompassing Chicago and parts of Atlanta have
            made similar claims in lawsuits against units of Bank of America
            and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The banks deny the claims, which allege
            violations of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is City of Los Angeles v. JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            14-cv-04168, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
            (Los Angeles.) &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. hired Gregg Brody, a high-yield energy analyst, from JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brody will be replacing Kelly Krenger, who is leaving the
            Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender, according to the memo.
            He will report to Larry Bland, the head of U.S. credit research,
            according to the memo, the contents of which were confirmed by
            Rinat Rond, a spokeswoman at Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brody, who will start in his new position at the end of
            July, has previously worked at Deutsche Bank AG, Germany's
            biggest lender, according to records maintained by the Financial
            Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Krenger had joined the bank in 1996 and headed the high-yield energy team, Bland wrote in the memo.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There are as many as 337 bonds in the Bloomberg high-yield
            energy index with a market value of $218.5 billion, bond index
            data show. That compares with 179 issues with a value of $108.4
            billion at the end of 2012, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds sold by energy companies are the second-most actively
            traded securities in the last three months behind those of
            financial firms, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) named Claudia Jury and Pranav Thakur as global co-heads of foreign
            exchange
            and emerging markets, part of a wider reshuffle prompted by the
            surprise departure of Mike Cavanagh two months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kanav Bhagat, who was head of U.S. rates trading, will
            become global head of rates, according to a memo to employees
            from James Kenny and Troy Rohrbaugh, co-heads of global rates,
            foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets. Bhagat is
            filling a role that Rohrbaugh had starting in 2012. A JPMorgan
            spokesman in London confirmed the contents of the document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This team will focus on monetizing the opportunities made
            available by changes in market structure and the competitive
            landscape while also continuing to aggressively grow our client

            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, head of the corporate and investment bank for
            New York-based JPMorgan, named Kenny and Rohrbaugh co-heads of
            global rates, foreign exchange, commodities and emerging markets
            last month. Pinto, 51, is overhauling reporting lines across the
            division after becoming its sole chief following Cavanagh's move

            head of electronic trading for the four areas overseen by Kenny
            and Rohrbaugh. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jury previously oversaw global foreign-exchange spot
            trading and Thakur ran rates and currencies in Asia, excluding
            Japan. Stephen Jefferies was named head of emerging markets and
            Europe, Middle East and Africa foreign exchange, reporting to
            Jury and Thakur, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reporting to Bhagat will be Charles Bristow, who was named
            head of derivatives and liquid government bonds in Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, and Carl Norrey, who will manage
            sovereign credit default swap trading and non-liquid European
            government bond trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, also named Jeff Herbert-Smith as head of Australia
            markets, expanding his role
            managing fixed-income trading to include equities. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, said it's cooperating with various government
            authorities investigating the firm's foreign-exchange trading
            business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These investigations are in the early stages and the firm
            is cooperating with the relevant authorities,' the New York-based company said today in a quarterly filing
            with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc. (C) put their top London currency
            dealers on leave after regulators probing the manipulation of
            foreign-exchange rates started investigating the traders' use of
            an instant-message group, three people with knowledge of the
            moves said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are focusing on an instant-message group the
            traders set up to share information about their positions and
            client orders over a period of at least three years, four people
            with knowledge of the probe said last month. The roster of banks
            in the group changed as the men moved firms and also included
            Barclays Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG, three
            people with knowledge of the communications said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigators are weighing whether the messages amounted to
            attempts to manipulate the market, two people said. The five
            firms account for about 47 percent of the $5.3 trillion-a-day
            foreign-exchange market, according to a May survey by Euromoney
            Institutional Investor Plc. Two other traders, who weren't part
            of the conversations and who asked to not be identified because
            they do business with those involved, said that they and others
            in the market referred to the message group as 'The Cartel.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Chase Traders Extend Perfect Record Into Third Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) traders
            generated profits every day in the third quarter, extending
            their perfect record for 2013 as the Federal Reserve backed off
            plans to curtail a bond-purchase program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders made more than $200 million on three days this
            year, JPMorgan said today in a regulatory filing. The New York-based company is the biggest U.S. lender by
            assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street has been whipsawed as the Federal Reserve
            debates whether the economy is strong enough to justify reducing
            monthly bond purchases of about $85 billion that have kept
            borrowing costs low. Ten-year Treasury yields, which are used to
            set rates for some consumer and corporate loans, rose from this
            year's low of 1.63 percent on May 2 to 3 percent on Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading revenue at JPMorgan's corporate and investment
            bank, run by Daniel Pinto and Michael Cavanagh, fell 2 percent
            to $4.69 billion in the third quarter, the bank said when it
            reported earnings on Oct. 11. Fixed-income trading revenue
            declined 8 percent to $3.44 billion from a year earlier while
            equity-trading revenue rose 20 percent to $1.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, disclosed that authorities in the U.S. and abroad are
            investigating the lender's hiring practices in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has received subpoenas from the Securities and
            Exchange Commission and document requests from both the SEC and
            the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a company filing
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorities in the U.S. and abroad are looking at the
            bank's employment of people referred by clients, potential
            clients and government officials as well as hiring 'of certain
            former employees in Hong Kong, its business relationships with
            certain related clients in the Asia Pacific region and its
            engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region,' the bank
            said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and SEC are examining whether
            JPMorgan hired the children and other relatives of well-connected politicians and clients in hopes of
            steering business
            to the firm, possibly violating anti-bribery laws, a person with
            knowledge of the investigation said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The firm is cooperating with these investigations,' the
            New York-based bank said in the filing today. 'Separate
            inquiries on these or similar topics have been made by other
            authorities, including authorities in other jurisdictions, and
            the firm is responding to those inquiries.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
            Inc. (C), two of the three largest U.S. banks, said they're
            cooperating with various probes into the firms' foreign-exchange
            trading businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These investigations are in the early stages and the firm
            is cooperating with the relevant authorities,' New York-based
            JPMorgan said today in a quarterly filing with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. Citigroup, also based in New
            York, said in its 10-Q filing that it's responding to requests
            for information on probes by government agencies in the U.S. and
            other jurisdictions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators in London, Zurich, the U.S. and Asia are probing
            the foreign-exchange market after Bloomberg News reported in
            June that dealers in the industry said they had been front-running client orders, attempting to rig the
            benchmark
            WM/Reuters rates by colluding with counterparts and pushing
            through trades before and during the 60-second windows when the
            benchmarks are set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both JPMorgan and Citigroup put their top London currency

        <headline>JPMorgan Discloses Eight DOJ Probes From Asia to Madoff</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said that the
            U.S. Department of Justice is conducting at least eight separate
            investigations into the bank's activities, ranging from
            recruitment in Asia to its relationship with Ponzi scheme
            operator Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. bank disclosed for the first time in a
            filing yesterday that the Justice Department is examining its
            energy-trading practices, which were subject to a $410 million
            civil settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
            in July. Investigations are also focusing on mortgage-bond
            sales, interest-rate rigging, the credit-derivatives market, and
            the bank's trading loss last year, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said that it's a
            priority for his department and for President Barack Obama to
            hold banks accountable. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            visited Holder in September to try to negotiate a settlement of
            mortgage-related cases against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The scope and breadth of risky practices at JPMorgan are
            mind-boggling,' said Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve
            bank examiner who teaches risk management at Boston University.
            'Some of these probes are criminal, they're not even just civil
            anymore, and I think it's very telling about the broad risk-taking culture that was allowed under Jamie
            Dimon.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Currency Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The eight Justice Department investigations disclosed in
            JPMorgan's filing compare with one in Citigroup Inc.'s.
            Citigroup has disclosed two other investigations that weren't
            included in the latest filing because there was no material
            change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disclosures don't always specify whether the Justice
            Department is involved. For instance, both JPMorgan and
            Citigroup said they're cooperating with inquiries into the
            currency market without saying who's doing the investigating.
            The Justice Department is taking a leading role in the global
            probe into possible manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day
            foreign-exchange market, a department official said earlier this
            week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose $2.4 trillion in assets make it the biggest
            U.S. bank, last month reported its first quarterly loss under
            Dimon, 57, after taking a $7.2 billion after-tax charge to cover
            the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has tapped $8 billion of $28 billion in reserves
            set aside since 2010 to cover legal costs. JPMorgan said
            yesterday it may need as much as $5.7 billion more to cover
            'reasonably possible' losses in excess of the reserve, even
            after it added $9.2 billion in pretax cash to its litigation
            funds in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Wrong Message' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's purchase of Bear Stearns Cos. and some of
            Washington Mutual Inc.'s assets during the financial crisis have
            contributed to the bank's legal costs. American International
            Group Inc. CEO Robert Benmosche said the tough line taken
            against JPMorgan fails to account for the role that borrowers,
            regulators and government played in the crisis and may dissuade
            companies from making similar purchases in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'No good deed will go unpunished, and I think it's the
            wrong message to send, but the politicians want to punish
            someone here,' Benmosche, 69, said in an interview with Betty
            Liu on Bloomberg Television yesterday. 'We've got to stop the
            rhetoric about 'We've got to get the bad guys,' because I think
            most of us were the bad guys.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mortgage Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last week agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle
            claims from the Federal Housing Finance Agency that the bank
            misrepresented the quality of mortgage bonds it sold to Fannie
            Mae and Freddie Mac. That resolved part of a $13 billion
            settlement the company is seeking with state and federal
            authorities to close multiple investigations into its mortgage-securities sales practices. The U.S.
            Attorney's Office in
            Sacramento, California, is leading a criminal probe of the
            bank's mortgage business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorities in the U.S. and overseas are also looking at
            the bank's employment of people referred by clients, potential
            clients and government officials as well as hiring 'of certain
            former employees in Hong Kong, its business relationships with
            certain related clients in the Asia Pacific region and its
            engagement of consultants in the Asia Pacific region,'
            according to JPMorgan's filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, run by Preet Bharara, is examining whether JPMorgan
            violated criminal anti-bribery laws in hiring the children and other relatives of well-connected politicians
            and clients in hopes of steering business
            to the firm, a person with knowledge of the investigation said
            in August. JPMorgan said it was cooperating with the
            investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Madoff Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea, Singapore and India are among the locations
            where hiring practices are being scrutinized, the New York Times
            reported yesterday, citing unidentified people briefed on the
            matter. Investigators include authorities in the U.K., it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara's office is also is conducting an investigation
            into how JPMorgan handled Madoff's funds and whether it turned a
            blind eye to his multibillion-dollar fraud, the biggest Ponzi
            scheme in U.S. history. Bharara is weighing a deferred
            prosecution agreement or fine for JPMorgan in the Madoff probe,
            a person familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed yesterday that Bharara's office is
            examining whether the bank manipulated the electricity market.
            The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into JPMorgan's
            settlement with the FERC to see if any individuals committed any
            crimes, a person briefed on the matter said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The office is also conducting an investigation into
            JPMorgan's record trading loss last year by Bruno Iksil, who
            became known as the London whale because of the size of his
            trading bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Libor, CDS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former JPMorgan trader Julien Grout and his former boss,
            Javier Martin-Artajo, both of whom are in Europe and worked with
            Iksil, were indicted on securities fraud charges after being
            accused of trying to hide some of the more than $6.2 billion in
            losses in their unit last year. Grout and Martin-Artajo have
            denied wrongdoing, while Iksil is cooperating in the
            investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Additionally, JPMorgan is part of an industrywide
            investigation by the Justice Department and others looking at
            whether banks in the U.S. and abroad rigged benchmark interest
            rates tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The
            bank is cooperating with a probe of the credit-default swaps
            market that started in 2009, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said that it's also facing a civil investigation
            into its compliance with the Federal Housing Administration's
            direct endorsement program, which streamlines origination of
            federally insured home loans by banks and other lenders. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Fund Sparks Biggest High-Grade Bond Outflow Since June</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s Core Bond Fund
            reported a $2.3 billion withdrawal this week that spurred the
            biggest weekly outflow from U.S. investment-grade debt funds
            since June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund's net assets dropped 9.2 percent to $22.38 billion
            on Oct. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade funds reported a $2.67 billion outflow
            during the past
            week, with most of it coming from one fund, Bank of America
            Corp. (BAC) credit strategists Hans Mikkelsen and Yuriy Shchuchinov
            said in an Oct. 31 report, citing data from EPFR Global. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The withdrawal reported 'was likely a one-off event and no
            signal of a broader rotation out of high-grade bond funds,' the
            analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-grade bonds in the U.S. gained 1.5 percent in
            October as speculation mounted that the Federal Reserve will
            maintain its $85 billion of monthly asset purchases through
            March. Companies have sold $991.4 billion of the debt so far
            this year, on pace for the most ever, from $945.4 billion during
            the same period last year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Core Bond Fund (WOBDX) was started on Dec. 31, 1983,
            and focuses on investment-grade notes with medium-term
            maturities, according to the data. It had 25 percent of its
            assets in corporate bonds and 55.8 percent in mortgage debt as
            of Aug. 31, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Swiss Banks May Shrink on Higher Leverage, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN),
            Switzerland's biggest banks, may have to shrink their fixed-income, currencies and commodities activities if
            the nation's
            regulator imposes higher leverage ratios than currently planned,
            according to JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in particular would be hit by rules forcing
            banks to hold more capital in relation to their assets, analysts
            led by Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients today. While
            both firms are estimated to reach Swiss leverage ratios of at
            least 4.2 percent by 2015, a Finance Ministry proposal that the
            measure be raised to 6 percent would lead to 'material
            uncertainty' and possible cuts in FICC, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf told Schweiz
            am Sonntag in an interview published yesterday that leverage
            ratios of '6 percent to 10 percent are being discussed,'
            calling the current level 'too low.' Banks would have to
            'consider whether to carry on with investment banking or focus
            even more on asset management,' she told the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse declined 6.7 percent to 26.21 Swiss francs in
            Zurich trading, the biggest drop since June 2012, while UBS fell
            5.3 percent to 16.54 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Efforts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The focus on leverage is the latest effort by global
            regulators to prevent a repeat of taxpayer-funded rescues of the
            financial crisis. In the U.S., banking regulators proposed
            leverage ratios at 5 percent for holding companies and 6 percent
            for their banking units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Roland Meier, a spokesman at the Finance Ministry in Bern,
            said by telephone today there won't be any changes before the
            results of a 2015 too-big-to-fail bank review are published. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS said on Oct. 29 it probably won't be able to reach its
            profitability goal in 2015 after the Swiss regulator demanded it
            hold more capital for risks related to litigation. Credit Suisse
            last month reported third-quarter earnings that missed analysts'
            estimates as profit at its investment bank fell and said it's
            scaling back its interest-rates trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse would have to cut exposure by as much as 284
            billion francs ($312 billion), while UBS would have to shrink by
            as much as 260 billion francs, JPMorgan said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MarketAxess Names Ex-JPMorgan Banker Cruger to Board</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX), the owner
            of an electronic bond and derivatives-trading system, named
            former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) investment banker William Cruger to
            its board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cruger, 55, was vice chairman of investment banking for
            JPMorgan before leaving the firm in June, New York-based
            MarketAxess said today in a statement. He joins former Goldman
            Sachs Group inc. partner Jane Chwick, who was named to the
            electronic trading firm's board last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bill has been a trusted partner and investment-banking
            adviser to MarketAxess since the firm's inception,' Chief
            Executive Officer Rick McVey said in the statement. 'He is
            widely respected as one of the leading market structure experts
            in the global exchange and electronic-trading space.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Electronic bond trading is gaining momentum as new
            regulations curbing risk prompt banks to trim inventories of
            corporate debt, reducing their willingness to act as middlemen
            between buyers and sellers. Goldman Sachs has expanded its
            GSessions electronic-trading system, while BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the
            world's largest asset manager, decided this year to route some
            of its trades through MarketAxess's computerized system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cruger, who advised Raymond James Financial Inc. on its
            $930 million deal to acquire Morgan Keegan Co. last year, is
            at least the second senior adviser to exchanges and other
            securities businesses to leave New York-based JPMorgan in recent
            months. Joseph Molluso left to join electronic trading firm
            Virtu Financial LLC as its chief financial officer, the New
            York-based firm said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cruger held various senior positions at JPMorgan before
            being named vice chairman of investing banking including
            managing director in the financial institutions group from 1996
            to 2011, according to the statement. He earlier ran the firm's
            investment-banking practices in Asia and Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News,
            competes with MarketAxess to provide electronic-trading systems
            for fixed-income markets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Executive Dunleavy Named in FERC Complaint Retires</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Francis Dunleavy, the JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) energy executive who ran the Houston unit that developed
            trading strategies deemed illegal by the U.S. Federal Energy
            Regulatory Commission, has retired. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move, ending a career spanning more than three decades,
            took effect last month, Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New
            York-based bank, said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy, as head of JPMorgan's principal investments unit,
            oversaw bidding strategies that the FERC said manipulated power
            markets. JPMorgan agreed in July to pay $410 million and forgo
            collecting on $262 million in disputed payments from
            California's grid operator to settle the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy was a Bear Stearns Cos. veteran, joining that firm
            in 1982 and becoming one of its senior energy executives,
            according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records.
            JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, acquired Bear Stearns
            in 2008. Andrew Kittell and John Bartholomew, who both reported
            to Dunleavy, still work for the bank, Marchiony said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the FERC didn't sanction individuals in the case, the
            Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a separate probe to see
            if anyone committed crimes, a person briefed on the matter said
            in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dunleavy resigned from JPMorgan warehouse operator Henry
            Bath Son Ltd., effective Oct. 25, according to a filing
            earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;William Scherman, an attorney for Dunleavy at Gibson Dunn
            Crutcher LLP in Washington, said his client wasn't available to
            comment. Reuters reported on Dunleavy's departure from JPMorgan
            earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Leads U.S. Banks Boosting Share of European Bond Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks increased their share of
            Europe's fixed-income market at the expense of local competitors
            as trading volumes slid in 2013, Greenwich Associates said in an
            annual survey report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) retained its position as the biggest
            secondary-market trader of European fixed-income products, with
            a 12.8 percent market share, down from 13.3 percent in 2012,
            Stamford, Connecticut-based Greenwich said on its website today.
            Second-placed Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)'s portion shrank to 10.5 percent
            from 11.9 percent, while JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) increased its
            share to 9.3 percent from 8.5 percent and Citigroup Inc. (C) had 7.7
            percent, up from about 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors reported reduced liquidity in bond markets in the
            second half of 2013, according to Greenwich, as speculation that
            the Federal Reserve would reduce the pace of its $85 billion of
            monthly asset purchases damped demand. UBS AG (UBSN) exited most fixed-income markets, while other European
            banks scaled back to comply
            with Basel III regulatory requirements, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It has become more difficult for many institutions to
            execute trades, and our data suggest that they are reaching out
            to new dealers in an attempt to source needed liquidity,' Peter D'Amario, a Greenwich Associate consultant,
            said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European banks are increasing the number of trading
            counterparties to gain access to liquidity, according to
            Greenwich. They averaged nine counterparties in this year's
            survey versus 8.4 in 2012. This increase benefited U.S banks and
            European institutions including UniCredit SpA (UCG), Commerzbank AG,
            Banca IMI SpA and Rabobank Groep, the Greenwich report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays, Britain's second-biggest lender by assets, was
            Greenwich's 2013 'Quality Leader' in European fixed-income
            trading, sales and overall service in rates products. JPMorgan
            was the 2013 'Quality Leader' in European fixed-income
            research and overall European service in credit products. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Banker Backed $200 Million Madoff Loan in 2008</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) banker
            who managed Bernard Madoff's account said the con man was on
            track to receive a $200 million loan less than a month before
            his arrest if the request hadn't been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Bonventre, one of five ex-Madoff employees on trial
            for allegedly aiding the fraud, asked JPMorgan in November 2008
            to borrow twice Madoff's credit limit of $100 million, with U.S.
            Treasuries as collateral, Mark Doctoroff, who left the bank last
            year, testified yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They are doing well financially,' Doctoroff said of
            Madoff's securities firm in an e-mail to JPMorgan's credit
            department on Nov. 17, 2008. 'They are looking at the current
            market as an opportunity to make investments, true to their
            value investing style.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five former employees are accused of helping Madoff
            hide his fraud from customers, banks and regulators for years,
            and getting rich in the process. It's the first criminal trial
            stemming from the scheme, which prosecutors say started in the
            early 1970s and imploded at the peak of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The loan was part of a last-ditch attempt by Madoff to
            secure cash as his Ponzi scheme was collapsing and Bonventre's
            role in the application process was one of the many examples of
            his involvement in the fraud, prosecutors have said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            Daniel Bonventre, who oversaw the broker-dealer and proprietary trading operations of Madoff's company,
            where real trading took place, pleaded not guilty and has denied involvement in the fraud, saying he was
            duped like thousands of others. Close

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Weigh Chat-Room Ban Amid Regulatory Probes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is weighing whether to ban traders from using
            electronic chat rooms to communicate with peers at other firms as the forums draw scrutiny from global
            regulators, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's
            deliberations, which should be complete by early 2014, focus on multi-dealer chat rooms for currencies and
            other asset classes, said the person, who requested anonymity because the talks are private. Royal Bank of
            Scotland Group Plc, Britain's biggest publicly owned lender, and Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG,
            Switzerland's second-largest bank, also are reviewing chat-room use, two other people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulators
            have targeted traders' electronic messages, using them as evidence of wrongdoing in their investigations
            into the manipulation of benchmark interest rates and foreign-exchange markets. During a visit to London
            last month, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon called on employees to be vigilant about language
            in e-mails and instant messages, two people with knowledge of the matter said then. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            may encourage traders to use phones and e-mails rather than chat rooms to assist clients in large currency
            transactions, the person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tax Breaks Targeted, JPMorgan-Madoff, SAC: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Executive stock options, corporate
            jets and the tax break enjoyed by hedge-fund managers are among
            the targets for Democratic lawmakers seeking to negotiate a
            budget deal by next month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Democrats' list of options, obtained by Bloomberg News,
            sets the stage for a renewed clash with Republicans, who reject
            proposals to raise revenue as part of an agreement. Democrats
            say taxes must be on the table as lawmakers seek an annual
            budget that would replace some of the $1 trillion in automatic
            spending cuts now in effect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While congressional aides say the two sides are finding
            some areas of compromise on spending cuts, the standoff over
            revenue might be the main obstacle to reaching a deal by the
            lawmakers' self-imposed Dec. 13 deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Democrats have long urged Republicans to agree to scrap at
            least some of the tax preferences on their list, while
            Republicans argue that doing so would undermine efforts for a
            broader tax-code revision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One proposal to limit the ability of some business owners
            to avoid payroll taxes by claiming income as business profits
            would save $12 billion over the next 10 years, according to the
            Democrats' estimates. Another option is the carried-interest
            treatment that allows hedge-fund managers and private-equity
            advisers to pay a 20 percent tax rate on their income instead of
            the nation's top income rate of 39.6 percent. Ending that break
            would save more than $17 billion over a decade, according to the
            Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Limiting corporate deductions for 'excessive' executive
            stock options could save even more -- as much as $50 billion
            over the same period, the Democrats' list says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ending preferences for corporate jets and subsidies for
            yachts and vacation homes, combined, would bring in another $19
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representative Paul Ryan, the lead Republican negotiator
            and chairman of the House Budget Committee, has opposed
            including any tax measures as part of a budget agreement. The
            29-member panel, which met last week, will reconvene on Nov. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Ryan didn't respond to a request for

            their total payments to within about $2 billion of the cash aid
            they got after the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies, which were sustained by $187.5 billion in
            taxpayer money after they were placed under federal
            conservatorship in 2008, will make dividend payments by next
            month to boost their total returns to $185.2 billion, they said
            in separate filings Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under terms of their conservatorship, the government since
            last year has been taking all of the companies' quarterly
            profits beyond a $3 billion net-worth cap. The money counts as a
            return on the U.S. investment and not as a repayment of the aid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's aid and amount returned have left taxpayers
            $9 million ahead, according to a statement. The government has
            an additional $1 billion liquidation preference in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;China Agency Lists 181 Shanghai IPO Applications as of Nov. 7 &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The China Securities Regulatory Commission said 10
            applications were approved of 181 companies that submitted
            applications for initial public offerings on the Shanghai
            exchange as of Nov. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thirty applications were approved so far this year of 311
            companies applying for initial public offerings on Shenzhen's
            main and medium-small company board's initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forty-three applications of 265 companies that submitted
            applications for initial public offerings on Shenzhen's Chinext
            board were approved as of Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;SAC Tipper Aggarwal Pleads Guilty to Securities Fraud &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sandeep Aggarwal, a former research analyst with Collins
            Stewart LLC, admitted passing inside information about a deal
            involving Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to a former SAC
            Capital Advisors LP fund manager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aggarwal, 40, pleaded guilty to one count each of
            conspiracy and securities fraud Nov. 8 in federal court in
            Manhattan. He told U.S. Magistrate Judge Ronald Ellis that he
            tipped 'Richard Lee and others' about the Yahoo-Microsoft
            venture in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He told Ellis he was 'very sorry' for his actions, which
            he did to 'improve his standing as an analyst' and 'increase
            revenue' for his firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aggarwal faces as much as 25 years in prison when he's
            sentenced and may be deported to his native India. He agreed to
            cooperate with prosecutors in hopes of receiving leniency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aggarwal, 13-mj-01877, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan's Madoff Banker Backed $200 Million Loan in 2008 &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase Co. (NPM) banker who managed Bernard
            Madoff's account said the con man was on track to receive a $200
            million loan less than a month before his arrest if the request
            hadn't been dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Bonventre, one of five ex-Madoff employees on trial
            accused of aiding the fraud, asked JPMorgan in November 2008 to
            borrow twice Madoff's credit limit of $100 million, with U.S.
            Treasuries as collateral, Mark Doctoroff, who left the bank last
            year, testified Nov. 7 in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Doctoroff described Madoff's securities firm in an e-mail
            to JPMorgan's credit department on Nov. 17, 2008 as 'doing well
            financially.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five former Madoff employees are accused of helping
            Madoff hide his fraud from customers, banks and regulators for
            years and getting rich in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The loan was part of a last-ditch attempt by Madoff to
            secure cash as his Ponzi scheme was collapsing, and Bonventre's
            role in the application process was one of the many examples of
            his involvement in the fraud, prosecutors have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the loan never went through, Doctoroff said he
            thought the loan would have been granted and that he didn't know
            why the loan process stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said he never met Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonventre, who oversaw the broker-dealer and proprietary
            trading operations of Madoff's company, where real trading took
            place, pleaded not guilty and has denied involvement in the
            fraud, saying he was duped like thousands of others. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonventre's lawyer, Andrew Frisch, asked if the loan
            request and the fraudulent capital figures given by Bonventre
            could have come from Madoff himself. Doctoroff agreed Madoff
            could have given the fake figures to Bonventre. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
            comment on the testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan is
            investigating JPMorgan in relation to Madoff. Bharara is
            weighing a deferred-prosecution agreement or fine to resolve the
            probe, a person familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. O'Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Hedge Fund Founder Says U.K. Fraud Prosecutors Acted Unfairly &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magnus Peterson, the founder of the collapsed hedge fund
            Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd., is seeking to delay a criminal
            prosecution against him by arguing that U.K. prosecutors acted
            unfairly in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A decision by the director of the Serious Fraud Office to
            reopen a probe into the firm's collapse after the former
            director closed the investigation is an 'abuse of process' by
            the agency, Peterson's lawyer, Peter Lodder, said at a hearing
            in London Nov. 8. The court will hear his arguments in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peterson will also argue that the SFO's initial decision to
            open the probe could be unlawful. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weavering Capital, which once had about $640 million under
            management, collapsed in March 2009 after discovering the
            counterparty for its biggest trading position was controlled by
            the fund's manager. Peterson and about 10 employees were ordered
            by a U.K. court last year to repay a total of $450 million to
            liquidators of the collapsed hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peterson was charged in December with fraud and other
            counts related to the collapse. A trial is scheduled for October
            next year. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Bharara Says Budget Constraints May Derail Future Prosecutions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said a federal hiring
            freeze is threatening his office's ability to carry out its job
            of prosecuting financial and other crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara made the remarks Nov. 8 at a Practising Law
            Institute event in New York, where he spoke on a panel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're OK now but at some point that will cease to be
            true,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other governmental departments and offices have faced
            financial constraints as a result of federal budget cuts known
            as sequestration. Bharara said he's not able to replace
            prosecutors who leave through normal attrition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Also, in contrast to the SEC's policy to seek admissions
            from defendants only in a subset of cases, Bharara said there is
            'a very strong presumption' that if his office pursues a civil
            case, it will require admissions of wrongdoing. Companies will
            often be willing to pay 'huge sums' of money to settle a
            matter yet are ready to go to trial over an admission, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's not just the financial component, but the story
            needs to be told,' Bharara said. 'We're a little tired of
            recidivism.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharara said prosecutors are looking more into holding
            institutions accountable for employees' misconduct, both
            criminally and civilly. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appointed
            LeeAnn Ghazil Gaunt to be chief of the agency's Enforcement
            Division's Municipal Securities and Public Pensions Unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gaunt oversaw the commission's first 'pay-to-play'
            enforcement action for in-kind political campaign contributions.
            The action occurred in September 2012, when the agency charged
            Goldman Sachs (GS) with violations related to contributions to the
            state treasurer of Massachusetts, the agency said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bond Exodus at Broad Funds Hits Pimco, JPMorgan: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;In a year of record withdrawals from
            taxable bond funds, no category has been harder hit than the
            biggest broad market strategies managed by firms from Pacific
            Investment Management Co. (PTTRX) to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors yanked $61.8 billion from intermediate-maturity
            debt funds in the first nine months of the year, while pouring
            $46.2 billion into bonds maturing in less than three years,
            according to data compiled by Morningstar Inc. Buyers are
            showing a preference for shorter-maturity and high-yield bonds
            that are less sensitive to rising benchmark borrowing costs as
            the Federal Reserve weighs curtailing the pace of its
            unprecedented stimulus that's bolstered credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Concern is mounting that a general basket of bonds won't
            preserve income and generate returns for investors who reaped
            average annual gains of 6.3 percent from the start of 2009
            through last year. As the central bank prepares to start slowing
            its bond buying, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Broad
            Market Index is on pace for its first annual decline since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People aren't getting enough income from their bond
            portfolios as they need,' Michael Rawson, a fund analyst at
            Morningstar in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. 'You're
            going to see money come out of intermediate bond funds and into
            these more income producing bond categories.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pimco, JPMorgan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors withdrew $28.1 billion from Pimco's $247.9
            billion Total Return Fund in the first nine months of the year,
            the most among all intermediate bond strategies, Morningstar
            data show. JPMorgan's $24.6 billion Core Bond Fund had the third
            biggest outflow with $4.6 billion of redemptions, while American
            Funds' $28.2 billion Bond Fund of America reported $4.8 billion
            of withdrawals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the same period, non-traditional bond funds that give
            managers more flexibility in how they invest received $45
            billion of deposits, Morningstar data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While core bond categories have experienced outflows
            industry-wide, we have continued to see inflows into our
            absolute return and unconstrained strategies,' Mark Porterfield, a spokesman for Newport Beach,
            California-based
            Pimco, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Core Bond Fund, which was started on Dec. 31,
            1983, and focuses on investment-grade notes with medium-term
            maturities, reported a $2.3 billion withdrawal on Oct. 28,
            spurring the biggest weekly outflow from U.S. investment-grade
            debt funds since June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While there have been some withdrawals from JPMorgan's core
            bond strategies, 'most of the outflows have come from clients
            aiming to diversify their fixed-income portfolios,' with many
            of the same clients depositing money into flexible debt funds,
            Gregory Roth, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, said in
            an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The withdrawal last month reflected a client moving assets
            from the Core Bond fund into a different vehicle managed by the
            firm and not a rotation of money out of investment-grade debt,
            Roth said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buyers pulled $2.2 billion from broader bond strategies in
            the U.S. during the week ended Oct. 30, the biggest outflow in
            more than three years, data compiled by Royal Bank of Scotland
            Group Plc show. Funds focused on high-yield bonds reported
            $752.7 million of deposits in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade debt, rated below Baa3 by Moody's
            Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard Poor's, is
            less sensitive to rising interest rates because of the bigger
            premium it pays over benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Notes Underperform &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco's Total Return Fund, started in 1987 and managed by
            Bill Gross, has shrunk by an estimated $37.5 billion since the
            start of this year, ending October with about $248 billion in
            assets, according to data provided by Pimco and compiled by
            Bloomberg. It ceded its title as the world's largest mutual fund
            to Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, which ended October
            with $251 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Medium-term notes are poised to under-perform shorter-term
            ones for the first year since 2008, when the Fed embarked on an
            unprecedented quantitative easing program to jump start the
            world's biggest economy from the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds maturing in five to seven years have
            declined 0.01 percent this year compared with a 1.6 percent gain
            for notes maturing in one to three years, Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Treasury Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Broad Market Index
            has lost 2.01 percent this year after posting a 2.45 percent
            decline in the three months ended June 30, its biggest quarterly
            loss since the start of 1994. The index gained 4.53 percent in
            2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke rattled fixed-income markets
            in May by telling Congress that the central bank may reduce the
            pace of its $85 billion of monthly purchases of Treasuries and
            mortgage bonds if the economy showed sustained improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year Treasuries rose as high as 3.01 percent
            on Sept. 6, up from 1.76 percent at the end of December, as
            speculation mounted that the Fed would change the pace of its
            bond buying at its September meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While policy makers surprised forecasters by maintaining
            the level of stimulus, yields reached a seven-week high of 2.75
            percent at the end of last week as reports showed the economy
            expanded in the third quarter beyond projections and added more
            jobs in October than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Overriding Factor' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're in an environment where the likelihood is that
            interest rates are going to move higher and that hasn't been the
            case for 30 years,' Gregory Kamford, a credit analyst at RBS in
            Stamford, Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since the end of May, investors have removed $14 billion
            from U.S. intermediate-maturity corporate bond funds while
            putting $11.6 billion into funds focused on one-to-three year
            corporates and $12.9 billion into notes due in more than 10
            years, RBS data show. ' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, which manages $1.9 trillion globally,
            started three funds that focus on short-term bonds to address
            investor concern over rising interest rates, the Boston-based
            firm said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The only logic to follow at the moment is whether the
            central banks continue to supply the capital market with more
            liquidity,' Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial
            Capital LLC, said in a telephone interview. 'That seems to be
            the overriding factor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shell Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting
            corporate bonds from default in the U.S. rose, with the Markit
            CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which investors use
            to hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
            increasing 1.3 basis points from Nov. 8 to a mid-price of 73
            basis points as of 1:09 p.m. in New York, according to prices
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bond markets in the U.S. were closed yesterday for the
            Veterans Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The measure typically rises as investor confidence
            deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay
            the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
            obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
            equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
            debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc plans to sell dollar-denominated
            bonds in a four-part offering of notes due in five years or
            fewer after Europe's biggest oil company borrowed $3.75 billion
            of longer-term debt three months ago. Its Shell International
            Finance (RDSA) unit intends to sell two portions of floating-rate bonds
            due in two and three years and fixed-coupon notes that mature in
            three and five years, according to a person with knowledge of
            the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds of Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) are the most actively
            traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
            accounting for 3.6 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1
            million or more, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
            system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The New
            York-based telephone carrier raised $49 billion on Sept. 11 in
            the largest corporate bond issue ever. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gazprom Rebounds as JPMorgan Lifts to Overweight: Moscow Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Gazprom snapped two days of
            losses as JPMorgan Chase Co. raised Russia's natural gas
            export monopoly to the equivalent of buy, citing prospects for a
            Chinese deal and dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 1.3 percent to 146.64 rubles by 2:16
            p.m. in Moscow after falling 1.8 percent yesterday. The volume
            traded was equivalent to about 77 percent of the three-month
            average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gazprom rallied after JPMorgan raised it to overweight on
            the possibility of a gas contract with China and of switching to
            a dividend based on international reporting standards, according
            to an e-mailed note. The shares fell yesterday after Interfax
            reported Ukraine's state-run energy company halted purchases
            from the natural-gas exporter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'No other large cap stock in Russia offers better
            potential to double over the next three years than Gazprom, we
            believe,' JPMorgan analysts led by Artem Konchin said in an e-mailed note. 'We see the company's valuation
            as still
            undemanding, and its ability to generate cash remains intact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gazprom's global depositary receipts increased 0.5 percent
            to $8.88 in London. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Fourth-Quarter Trading Revenue Is Lower</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s fourth-quarter trading revenue will be slightly down from last year,
            according to Michael Cavanagh, who co-runs the bank's corporate
            and investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Fixed income and equities are tracking very well versus
            client volumes, which are down slightly' from last year,
            Cavanagh said at an investor conference in New York today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-banking fees for underwriting bond and equity
            issuance and advising on mergers and acquisitions are
            'healthy' this quarter and may be close to the previous three
            months, when JPMorgan generated $1.5 billion in fees, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Last year's fourth quarter was a particularly strong
            underwriting quarter. I don't think we'll achieve that again,
            but it's a healthy quarter,' Cavanagh said, adding that the
            final figure 'might come in looking something similar to the
            third quarter.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cavanagh and Daniel Pinto run the corporate and investment
            bank, whose traders compiled a perfect record in the first nine
            months of this year by generating profits every day the markets
            were open. On three of those days, traders made more than $200
            million, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing this month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Settlement Truth in Advertising Sought on Taxes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;An aspect of U.S. tax law is being criticized by some lawmakers and consumer groups concerned that
            it may be worth billions of dollars for JPMorgan Chase Co in negotiations with the Department of Justice.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An agreement between the government and the bank over mortgage-bond sales that's silent
            on taxes would let the company take a deduction and shave 35 percent off any settlement cost publicized in
            headlines. That would, for example, turn an announced settlement of $10 billion into one for $6.5 billion.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It shouldn't have hidden subsidies or sweeteners in the settlement,' said Francisco
            Enriquez, a tax and budget associate at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which says it operates as a
            counter to big banks. 'If the DOJ is in the end going to look for a $6.5 billion price tag, then that's what
            they should say.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tax implications are a complicated part of settlement talks between
            companies and the U.S. government. Companies focused on after-tax costs negotiate with government agencies
            that may be more concerned about how big a payment they can claim to have extracted than about how much
            money ends up in the Treasury. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'At dinner parties, a billion sounds better than $700
            million, even if a billion is tax deductible and $700 million is not,' said Gregg Polsky, a law professor at
            the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied the taxation of penalties and damage
            payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, a DOJ spokesman, declined to comment because the talks are
            continuing on resolving multiple legal issues surrounding the mortgage-bond sales. Also declining to comment
            was Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fines, Restitution &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. tax law places payments to government agencies into two categories: fines and penalties, which
            are not deductible, and compensatory damages and restitution, which can be deducted as business expenses.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a settlement agreement is silent on taxes, a company is free to claim a deduction
            against the 35 percent federal corporate income tax and state income taxes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Internal
            Revenue Service may challenge the deduction, a path that can lead to litigation over whether payments were
            deductible restitution or non-deductible penalties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some government settlement accords
            include clauses where companies agree not to take deductions. For example, the agreement this month between
            the Justice Department and SAC Capital Advisors LP prevented the hedge fund from deducting any of the $1.8
            billion payment in that settlement and a related case with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $5.1 billion settlement on Oct. 25 with the Federal Housing Finance Agency included no
            clause limiting tax deductions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Pretty Clear' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Absent such an
            agreement, I think it's pretty clear that virtually all of the payment will be deductible,' said Robert
            Willens, a New York-based tax and accounting consultant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers including
            Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, want the bank to forgo a tax deduction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It
            was the taxpayer who initially funded the bailout of Wall Street,' Welch wrote on Oct. 30 to Jamie Dimon,
            the bank's chairman and chief executive officer. 'It was the taxpayer who continues to endure the
            consequences of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The taxpayer should not, therefore, be
            required to contribute a nickel towards the fines imposed for conduct that got America into this mess in the
            first place.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grassley, Reed &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa
            Republican, and Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, introduced legislation this month that would
            require the government and companies to reach advance agreements on how settlements will be taxed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 2007 version of the measure was estimated to generate $263 million in government revenue over 10
            years, according to Jill Gerber, a spokeswoman for Grassley. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cases with punitive and
            compensatory components are complicated by the differing goals of those involved in the negotiations, Polsky
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The defendant cares about the after-tax dollars,' he said. 'The IRS cares about
            the after-tax dollars. The regulatory agency that's settling the case, they don't seem to care about the
            after-tax' amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enriquez said settlement deductibility is a systemic issue that
            amounts to a loophole, letting companies deduct payments that are really being made to avoid formal fines.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Quite Angry' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Wrongdoing should not constitute a tax writeoff and
            wrongdoing shouldn't be subsidized by the American people,' he said. 'People are just generally quite angry
            and rightfully so that JPMorgan could get a massive $3.5 billion tax deduction for their suffering.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Willens said lawmakers have become more aware of the deductibility of settlements, making it
            possible that the JPMorgan agreement could include clauses on taxes to make the real cost more closely match
            the announced amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Given the outrage that has been expressed by some about the
            ability to deduct this, including some pretty influential politicians, I would think there probably would be
            something in the agreement,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Reed-Grassley bill is S. 1654. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Hilton Commercial Mortgage Bonds Said to Be Marketed by JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks led by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            are marketing $3.5 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds tied to
            Hilton Worldwide Inc. as Blackstone Group LP prepares to take
            the hotelier public, people with knowledge of the offering said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest such transaction since the credit crisis is
            linked to 23 properties across the U.S., said the people, who
            asked not to be identified because terms aren't public. JPMorgan
            is working with Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp., Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley to arrange the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hilton deal comes with sales of securities linked to
            commercial real estate loans poised to surpass $70 billion in
            2013, more than double the volume in 2012, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The commercial-mortgage securities are
            enabling Blackstone (BX), the world's largest private-equity firm, to
            pay down a portion $13.4 billion in debt refinanced in October,
            deal documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2007 takeover of Hilton for $26 billion was the largest
            ever for a hotel company, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone restructured the debt in April 2010, reducing
            its debt load by $4 billion and pushing back maturities to 2015,
            as consumers and businesses cut back on travel amid the economic
            downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seven months later, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs
            sought to sell about $3 billion of the restructured debt in a
            commercial-mortgage bond deal. The transaction was cut in half
            when investors demanded additional yield to buy the securities,
            prompting Goldman to pull its portion of the sale, people with
            knowledge of the deal said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Real estate investors are cashing in on hotels as values
            climb along with occupancy and room rates. Prices for
            hospitality properties in non-major markets, which excludes the
            largest U.S. cities such as New York, have climbed 28.3 percent
            over the last 12 months, according to Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Highfields Capital Management LP,
            the Boston hedge fund run by Jonathon Jacobson, sold its stake
            in JPMorgan (JPM) Chase Co. and Oracle (ORCL) Corp. in the third quarter
            and halved its holdings in Capital One Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Highfields sold more than 1.9 million shares of New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender,
            according to a
            regulatory filing today. The hedge fund also sold 500,000 shares
            of Capital One, the bank and credit-card issuer based in McLean,
            Virginia, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hedge fund eliminated its 3.4 million shares in Oracle,
            the software company based in Redwood City, California founded
            by Larry Ellison. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Highfields disclosed a 2.69 million-share stake in
            Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO), the New York company that
            owns, develops and manages office buildings, worth about $51.4
            million at current prices. The fund also added 294,000 shares of
            PacWest Bancorp, the Los Angeles-based bank holding company,
            valued at about $11.5 million at today's closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
            equities must file a Form 13F with the U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission within 45 days of each quarter's end to list
            their U.S.-traded stocks, options and convertible bonds. The
            filings don't show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the

        <headline>JPMorgan Gets Map to Descend FSB Surcharge Plateau With HSBC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Global regulators this week put
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) at the pinnacle of a
            list of 29 too-big-to-fail banks that face tougher capital rules
            than other lenders. The companies were also handed a map to plot
            their descent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For the first time since it started compiling a roster of
            lenders whose collapse would threaten the global economy, the
            Basel Committee on Banking Supervision also disclosed the
            thresholds for how it determined the level of extra capital
            requirements that such banks should face. The move will enable
            lenders to find ways to move down to a lower surcharge category
            or exit the list altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The capital surcharges for globally systemic lenders add an
            extra layer of safety beyond beefed-up standards known as Basel
            III that emerged in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman
            Brothers Holdings Inc. Regulators said the additional buffers
            were vital to protect taxpayers and prevent crises from
            cascading through the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think the Basel committee would be quite happy in this
            instance for banks to change their scores by becoming smaller,
            less interconnected, less complex,' said Patricia Jackson, head
            of prudential advisory at Ernst Young LLP in London. 'It's
            also a shot across the bows in the sense that if they become
            more complex, larger, relative to others they go up the list.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the target of at least eight Justice Department investigations, was mocked and
            taunted by Twitter users after asking followers to send questions to an executive using the hashtag #AskJPM.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The online forum, which the bank canceled late yesterday, was intended in part to give
            college students an opportunity to communicate directly with a senior executive, said Brian Marchiony, a
            spokesman for the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'#Badidea! Back to the drawing board,' the
            bank posted less than six hours after its original post, which drew more than 6,000 responses from users in
            that span, according to social media tracking service Topsy. The #AskJPM hashtag had more than 24,000 posts
            on Twitter as of 10 a.m. New York time, according to Topsy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If you're in the banking
            industry with what's happened over the last five years, it might not be a good idea to go out and solicit
            comments on social media,' said Brad Adgate, a senior vice president at marketing firm Horizon Media Inc. in
            New York. 'They are paying all these fines and billions of dollars to the federal government. I question the
            timing of this.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 'Snarkpocalypse,' as @ReformedBroker dubbed it, started after the
            company's official Twitter account posted a call for questions at 1:26 p.m. in New York yesterday for
            investment bank Vice Chairman James Lee, using #AskJPM. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Examines JPMorgan Ties to Daughter of China's Wen, NYT Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities are examining
            JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) ties to a consulting firm owned by the
            daughter of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao as part of a probe
            into whether the bank awarded contracts and jobs in order to win
            business deals, the New York Times reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is cooperating with the Securities and Exchange
            Commission and the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, which are
            leading the investigation, and also conducting its own internal
            review, the newspaper reported. The bank hasn't been accused of
            any wrongdoing, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lisa Liang, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and the U.S.
            Justice Department will announce tomorrow a $13 billion
            settlement to resolve civil probes into the bank's sale of

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Agree to Cover WaMu Costs on Mortgage Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to drop
            litigation against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. over some
            mortgage bonds sold by Washington Mutual Inc., clearing the way
            for a $9 billion accord with state and federal officials, two
            people briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement will be announced tomorrow, said one of the
            people, requesting anonymity because the negotiations aren't
            public. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender by assets, agreed
            today to the terms of $4 billion in consumer relief payments,
            the person said. The remaining $5 billion will go toward
            penalties and resolving claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank battled with the FDIC over who should pay some
            liabilities from WaMu, the failed Seattle thrift that the agency
            placed into receivership in 2008 while selling assets to New
            York-based JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement, which is being brokered by the Justice
            Department, won't interfere with JPMorgan's ability to sue the
            FDIC to cover part of a $4 billion settlement last month with
            the Federal Housing Finance Agency, two people familiar with the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It also won't prohibit the bank from seeking reimbursement
            from the FDIC for claims against WaMu from private investors,
            they said. JPMorgan announced a tentative $4.5 billion deal last
            week with 21 institutional investors, including Pacific
            Investment Management Co., to settle claims that the lender and
            its subsidiaries sold faulty mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Attorneys General &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $9 billion settlement, which includes a $2 billion
            fine, will end civil investigations by the Justice Department
            and the California and New York state attorneys general, as well
            as lawsuits by the FDIC and National Credit Union
            Administration, people briefed on the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrew Gray, a spokesman for the FDIC, JPMorgan's Brian Marchiony and Brian Fallon at the Justice
            Department said they
            couldn't comment because the negotiations are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consumer-relief portion of the accord, negotiated over
            the weekend by Associate Attorney General Tony West and U.S.
            Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan, requires
            JPMorgan to hire an independent monitor and provide the entire
            $4 billion by the end of 2016, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's costs include at least $1.5 billion in principal
            writedowns for struggling homeowners with federally backed
            loans, the person said. Of that, $1.2 billion would be for first
            lien principal writedowns. At least $300 million must go toward
            forbearance, in which banks shift loan terms to account for a
            change in a debtor's income, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vacant Homes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An additional $2 billion would fund interest-rate
            reductions of existing loans, new loans or loan originations
            that JPMorgan would be required to keep in its portfolio, the
            person said. The bank also would receive credit for so-called
            anti-blight efforts, such as the costs of demolishing vacant
            homes and absorbing the mortgages of such properties the bank
            has yet to foreclose on, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If JPMorgan doesn't provide the entire $4 billion by the
            end of 2016 then the bank would be required to pay any leftover
            portion to the government or a nonprofit, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. ended plans to manage China Everbright Bank Co.'s Hong Kong share sale amid a
            U.S. investigation into the Wall Street firm's hiring practices in China, two people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank told Everbright it would quit the deal, which at $2 billion
            would be the largest first-time offering by a Chinese lender in Hong Kong since 2009, because the probe
            delayed an internal approval process, the people said. They asked not to be identified because the matter is
            confidential. Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S.
            authorities are examining whether New York-based JPMorgan violated anti-bribery laws by hiring the children
            and other relatives of well-connected politicians and clients in China so that their family members would
            steer business to the firm, a person with knowledge of the investigation said in August. JPMorgan said it
            was cooperating with the probes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May
            requested records from JPMorgan concerning Tang Xiaoning, the son of China Everbright Group Chairman Tang
            Shuangning, the New York Times reported in August, citing a confidential government document. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) will pay a record $13 billion to resolve U.S. Justice Department probes
            into the bank's sale of mortgage bonds that officials said helped feed the financial chaos of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The accord settles allegations that JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, misled investors
            and the public when it sold bonds backed by faulty residential mortgages, according to Justice Department
            statement today. U.S. and state officials blamed the bank's actions in the statement for helping to cause
            the credit crisis, and said the settlement doesn't shield JPMorgan or its employees from criminal charges.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Without a doubt, the conduct uncovered in this investigation helped sow the seeds of
            the mortgage meltdown,' Attorney General Eric Holder said in the statement. 'JPMorgan was not the only
            financial institution during this period to knowingly bundle toxic loans and sell them to unsuspecting
            investors, but that is no excuse for the firm's behavior.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief
            executive officer, said in a separate statement that the settlement resolves a significant portion of claims
            tied to mortgage-backed securities issued by the lender and two firms it bought during the credit crisis,
            Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.'s bank unit. The sum is covered by reserves, and JPMorgan is
            cooperating with the Justice Department's criminal case, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Henry Bath Profit Fell to $2.4 Million on Taxes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Henry Bath Son Ltd., the
            commodities warehouse unit of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) that it wants
            to sell, reported profit of $2.4 million last year as revenue
            jumped 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Profit dropped from $27.7 million a year earlier due to tax
            changes, Liverpool, England-based Henry Bath said in a filing
            with the U.K.'s Companies House. Before taxes, profit rose to
            $42.57 million from $34.19 million. Revenue rose to $148.96
            million from $120.28 million. The company provides storage for
            cocoa, coffee and metal stockpiles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Stock holdings have continued to grow through 2012,
            resulting in a positive impact on the group profits,' Henry
            Bath said in the filing. It had net assets of $311.9 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, said in July that it plans
            to get out of the business of owning and trading physical
            commodities. The firm could sell or spin off holdings that
            include Henry Bath, as well as stakes in power plants and
            traders in materials such as gas and coal. The New York-based
            firm has sought $3.3 billion for the division, a person with
            direct knowledge of the sale process said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan May Sell $4 Billion of Private-Equity Stakes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., which is planning to break off its buyout unit, is in talks to sell about $4
            billion of private-equity stakes to an investor group, said three people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The potential buyers examining the holdings include Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Coller
            Capital Ltd., Lexington Partners, HarbourVest Partners LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Ardian, said two of
            the people. They asked not to be named because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investor group
            would also provide capital for new deals to One Equity Partners, the private-equity arm of JPMorgan that's
            in the process of becoming an independent firm. The business, which used to invest the bank's own money,
            will begin raising its next fund from an external group of investors, the bank said in June. JPMorgan joins
            banks including Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. in cutting back private-equity holdings to focus
            on its main businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to comment, as
            did officials for the investment firms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. lender, agreed
            in September to sell its emerging-markets private-equity unit to the Rohatyn Group to comply with new curbs
            on bank investments. Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-biggest bank, in February struck a deal to sell its
            stake in the first fund of Global Infrastructure Partners to Lexington Partners Inc., according to a person
            with knowledge of the matter. The bank in August agreed to sell its private-equity, infrastructure and real
            estate investment business to Grosvenor Capital Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Guillaume Poitrinal, former Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL) chairman and chief executive officer, plans to
            set up
            a property fund with JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) real estate analyst
            Harm Meijer, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Information about the fund and what it will invest in will
            be announced early next year, said the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the matter isn't yet public. The fund may
            have a third founding partner, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Poitrinal, 45, ran Unibail-Rodamco, the largest European
            real estate investment trust, from 2005 until he stepped down in
            April. The Paris-based company operates malls in 12 countries.
            Poitrinal didn't respond to a text message requesting comment
            and his phone was busy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meijer has been the top-rated European real estate analyst
            in the annual Thomson Reuters Extel ratings for the past five
            years. Meijer declined to comment on his role with the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tim Leckie was appointed to succeed Meijer as head of
            JPMorgan's team of European real estate analysts today, one of

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s record $13
            billion deal to end probes into mortgage-bond sales may save the
            bank billions more because of what the agreement lacked: an
            explicit admission of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Employees of JPMorgan and two firms it acquired knew some
            of the loans included in bonds didn't meet underwriting
            standards, a fact not shared with buyers of those securities,
            the U.S. Justice Department said yesterday in a statement. That
            doesn't mean the company misled investors, said Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake, disputing how some state and federal
            officials characterized the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, sought to end one of the
            largest legal uncertainties it faced without providing fodder to
            private litigants. The firm is still the subject of Justice
            Department probes into its energy-trading business, recruiting
            practices in Asia and its relationship with Ponzi scheme
            operator Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've left themselves some wiggle room to say, 'No we
            didn't violate the law',' said Peter Henning, a former federal
            prosecutor and Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who
            teaches law at Wayne State University in Detroit. 'There is at
            least some acknowledgment that there were improprieties, but
            exactly what they were remains open, and certainly they can deny
            it in any specific case.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department's $13 billion
            mortgage securities settlement with JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is a
            record and also a rarity -- Attorney General Eric Holder's first
            big win against a bank at the heart of 2008's financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Holder, the part of the deal announced this week that
            requires the bank to pay $9 billion to resolve allegations it
            knowingly sold bad mortgage securities is a potential turning
            point after a tenure studded with controversy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several more announcements are on the way to bring
            financial institutions to account, Holder has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have to wait until we are finished with all the work
            that we will do,' Holder said in an interview. 'When we get to
            that point you will see that we have taken the mandate that we
            were given seriously, that we held people accountable, that we
            held institutions accountable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan deal has its critics. Some say it's too tough
            on the bank after the government called it in to take over Bear
            Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Bank when they failed. Others
            say Holder hasn't gone far enough, because he hasn't brought
            criminal charges against bankers. Several lawmakers and others
            have faulted the deal for leaving open the possibility that the
            bank could write off a portion of the penalties, essentially
            passing some of the burden to taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>The JPMorgan Settlement Isn't Justice</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;For years the public has vented about half-baked government settlements in which corporations and
            white-collar defendants 'neither admit nor deny' the allegations against them. The Justice Department wasn't
            about to go down that path when it unveiled its big, not-really-$13 billion deal this week with JPMorgan
            Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the government made a few sly tweaks. The result is a mutant offspring of
            the no-admit genre that may be even less satisfying than the parent. JPMorgan didn't have to admit to any
            violations of the law. And here's the rub: The Justice Department didn't allege any, either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According
            to the settlement agreement, the bank will pay a civil penalty 'pursuant to' a statute called the Financial
            Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act. However, the Justice Department didn't lodge any claims
            against JPMorgan for breaking that law or any other. This was an out-of-court settlement. The Justice
            Department didn't file a complaint. No judge's approval was needed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agreement did
            incorporate an 11-page statement of facts that explained in vague terms what JPMorgan did. Yet none of the
            acknowledgments by JPMorgan in that document hurt the bank. JPMorgan didn't admit liability or even any
            mistakes. That's no better than the old 'neither admit nor deny' boilerplate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No
            Justice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn't justice. It's more like the greenmail that companies sometimes pay
            to corporate raiders who demand premium prices for their shares in exchange for going away. No individuals
            got pinched. We don't know much about the details of what the Justice Department's investigation found. It's
            unclear why prosecutors didn't accuse JPMorgan of fraud, although one possible explanation is that the
            government lacks proof. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The wording of the settlement agreement was awkward at times,
            too. It said the Justice Department had investigated the mortgage-bond operations of JPMorgan and two
            failing companies that it bought: Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc. 'Based on those
            investigations, the United States believes that there is an evidentiary basis to compromise potential legal
            claims by the United States against JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, for violation of federal
            laws,' the agreement said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That line makes it seem like the U.S. doubted its own case,
            although perhaps it was just poorly drafted. The sentence would have made more sense if it said there was
            enough evidence to 'bring' claims against JPMorgan, not 'compromise' them. Maybe the prosecutors were trying
            to say they believed there was sufficient evidence to merit a settlement. But that doesn't make much sense,
            either: The act of settling speaks for itself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an aside, it's fitting that
            Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley took part in the same accord. Of the $13 billion headline
            figure -- which combined the Justice Department's $2 billion penalty with the amounts secured by several
            state and federal agencies -- the settlement agreement earmarked about $34 million for Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2009, Coakley took a similar claim-free approach to squeeze money from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            Her office didn't file a lawsuit or allege that Goldman Sachs violated any statutes or rules. Goldman Sachs
            didn't admit anything, either. But it did pay $60 million to make the Massachusetts investigation go away.
            Coakley's office had been looking into Goldman Sachs's packaging of subprime mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surely
            some of the money that JPMorgan shells out will go to good use. Yet something important is lost when
            law-enforcement officials strike bargains with powerful corporations behind closed doors and fail to be
            transparent about what their investigations uncovered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said this
            week that the settlement 'does not absolve JPMorgan or its employees from facing any possible criminal
            charges.' By this point, though, it's hard to take the Justice Department seriously when it says to stay
            tuned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not Really &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The department also said that 'JPMorgan
            acknowledged it made serious misrepresentations to the public' as part of the agreed-upon statement of
            facts. Actually, it did no such thing. The document didn't use the word 'misrepresentation' or similar
            language to describe any of JPMorgan's actions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Usually when corporations settle with
            the Justice Department, they agree not to contradict the government's assertions publicly. Yet on this
            occasion JPMorgan felt compelled to set the record straight. 'We didn't say that we acknowledge serious
            misrepresentation of the facts,' JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said during a Nov. 19
            conference call. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was right: The Justice Department overreached in its
            characterization. It isn't a good sign when the company paying billions of dollars to resolve a government
            probe comes across as more believable than the government lawyers who cut the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Jonathan

        <headline>BlackRock Says JPMorgan Deal Undermining U.S. Market: Mortgages</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) record $13
            billion deal to end mortgage bond probes has terms that
            undermine U.S. efforts to reduce taxpayer support of the market,
            according to BlackRock Inc., the world's biggest money manager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Washington has a public policy goal of reducing the role
            that the government plays in the housing-finance market, and at
            the same time we now have a series of settlements where no
            investors were at the table and where money toward the
            settlements may come from investors' pockets,' said Barbara Novick, vice chairman of BlackRock. 'It
            discourages the
            allocation of private capital to mortgage credit.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan struck the agreement this week to settle potential
            state and federal civil claims of misrepresentations in
            mortgage-bond sales by the lender and companies it acquired. The
            largest U.S. bank can earn credit toward meeting $4 billion of
            consumer relief required by the deal through reworking mortgages
            owned by investors in the securities, potentially harming
            holders, according to Novick. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock (BLK), which oversees $4.1 trillion, and other buyers
            of mortgage bonds without government backing have criticized
            multiple federal and local actions in the wake of the U.S.
            housing crash as unfair to investors, saying they deter
            participation in the $9.3 trillion home-mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Best Interest' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With taxpayer-backed programs financing about 85 percent of
            new home loans, issuance of non-agency bonds is about 1 percent
            of the record level reached in 2005 and 2006. Sales of
            commercial-mortgage securities have recovered to 34 percent of a
            pre-crisis peak and loans to junk-rated companies are on pace to
            exceed $1 trillion this year, more than during the boom years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Loan modifications will be done only if they are in the
            best interest of the investor and in accordance with the bank's
            agreements with the investors,' said Adora Andy Jenkins,
            Justice Department spokeswoman. 'So when these modifications
            are made, it's because they're good for investors, consumers and
            neighborhoods across the country that are still recovering from
            the financial crisis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock's Novick said, 'that's hard for us as investors
            to measure: We don't get enough transparency into what's going
            on.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, JPMorgan will receive partial credit
            for steps it takes on loans serviced for others, according to a
            settlement document on the Justice Department's website. For
            instance, the bank typically will get a 50 cent credit for each
            dollar of principal reductions for homeowners whose debt it
            doesn't own. The bank gets 100 percent for loans it owns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lobbying Justice &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Association of Mortgage Investors was among groups that
            lobbied the Justice Department to preclude the bank from getting
            credit for loans owned by investors to help fulfill its
            obligations, as occurred with 2012 agreements over foreclosure
            practices involving JPMorgan and four other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 32 percent of credit granted to JPMorgan under the
            earlier deal was tied to loans the bank serviced and didn't
            hold, according to a court filing last month by the monitor for
            the settlement, which was sparked by allegations of 'robo-signing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Graham Fisher Co. analyst Joshua Rosner said that
            allowing any consumer aid that may harm bondholders to be part
            of the latest deal makes little sense. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Investors Misled' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These were claims about investments where investors were
            misled,' Rosner said in a Nov. 19 interview on Bloomberg
            Television. 'Why is money going to consumers?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Homeowners also were harmed by shoddy securitization
            practices, according to a government official involved in the
            settlement. Giving JPMorgan credit for loans held within bonds
            will help more of the neediest get aid because many of the worst
            mortgages were packaged into securities, said the official, who
            asked not to be named because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, Democrat and Republican lawmakers
            and regulators including the Treasury Department and Federal
            Housing Finance Agency have all said they want more private
            capital in the home-loan market five years after the government
            rescued Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond investors are still wary of the market after
            record losses from the worst housing crash since the Great
            Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Bears Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.
            home loans from 2005 through 2008 placed into non-agency bonds
            have experienced more than $76 billion of losses, and $30
            billion of the remaining debt is at least 60 days delinquent,
            according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Promised Quality &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors, insurers and regulators have said in lawsuits
            against JPMorgan that reviews of soured loans showed in some
            cases that more than 80 percent failed to match their promised
            quality. The bank bought Washington Mutual's banking assets and
            Bear Stearns in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock, which is JPMorgan's biggest shareholder, and
            other investors have also opposed efforts by local governments
            to use their eminent domain powers to seize and rework mortgages
            held within bonds. The asset manager, which joined in August
            with competitors to seek a court order to block Richmond,
            California's efforts to advance such a plan, contends it will
            depress private lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Municipalities in about 11 states from California and
            Washington to Ohio, New York, New Jersey are still at least
            looking into the idea, according toRobert Hockett, a Cornell
            University professor who's advised the local governments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The servicer settlement and the eminent domain proposals
            all discourage private capital,' Novick said in a telephone
            interview. 'If you don't know what your rights are as an
            investor, why would you allocate capital?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investors' Ire &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors' ire has built since a 2008 settlement between
            Bank of America Corp.'s Countrywide Financial unit and state
            attorneys general in which claims of predatory lending yielded a
            deal that called for mostly investor-owned loans to be revised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since then, state and federal governments have taken a
            series of steps to temporarily freeze or slow foreclosures.
            Congress passed a law protecting servicers from certain investor
            suits and the federal Home Affordable Modification Program was
            structured in a way that aids banks, mortgage investors have
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In JPMorgan's latest deal, the bank can get credit for
            extinguishing second mortgages a day before a foreclosure in
            which the debt will be wiped out, saidLaurie Goodman, director
            of Urban Institute's housing finance policy center. The bank
            gets 40 percent credit for non-performing second loans, up from
            as little as 10 percent in the earlier deal in which observers
            questioned the credit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Principal Forgiveness &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a role for giving credit for principal
            forgiveness on second liens but the 40 cents on the dollar seems
            miscalibrated,' said Goodman, a former mortgage-bond analyst at
            firms including UBS AG and Amherst Securities Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit is also available for refinancing Fannie Mae (FNMA) and
            Freddie Mac mortgages serviced by others under the federal Home
            Affordable Refinance Program, which JPMorgan 'might be doing
            anyway,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's costs from the consumer relief are already
            accounted for in its provisions, Chief Financial Officer
            Marianne Lakesaid on a Nov. 19 conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Giving JPMorgan partial credit on investor-owned loans
            hurts rather than helps bondholders because it means the lender
            has to write down more mortgages to get the same amount, said
            Chris Ames, a senior portfolio manager at Schroder Investment
            Management North America Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Judgment Call &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The decision by a servicer to write off debt is a
            judgment call,' Ames said in an e-mail. The type of settlement
            creates 'perverse incentives, and the servicing of private
            label securities isn't transparent enough for investors to
            evaluate the decision-making.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The perceived harm to bondholders would be even less likely
            if a separate agreement reached last week between JPMorgan and
            21 institutional investors including BlackRock is finalized,
            according to the government official. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under that proposed settlement of mortgage-bond holders'
            own claims of misrepresentations, JPMorgan would allow servicing
            on certain loans to be transferred along with paying $4.5
            billion. The agreement doesn't cover Washington Mutual debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trustees representing all investors in the deals have as
            many as 120 days to accept the proposal. Certain investors may
            seek to resist the accord, according to Nomura Securities
            International analysts Paul Nikodem andPratik Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nomura Estimate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 7 percent payout relative to past and projected losses
            on the loans is lower than the about 10 percent seen in a $8.5
            billion proposed deal reached in 2011 by Bank of America still
            being fought over in court, according to Nomura. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novick declined to comment on that settlement, whileKathy Patrick, a partner at Gibbs Bruns LLP
            representing the
            investor group, didn't return an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Novick said BlackRock isn't opposed to borrowers
            getting their balances lowered, the firm 'stands by' its view
            that the step should mainly occur under a mediation process in
            which borrowers' unsecured debt such as credit-card borrowing
            and second mortgages are extinguished first. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're in favor of the rule of law, and the forgiveness of
            debt in the order it should be under contract law,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

            kopeks by 4:34 p.m. in Moscow. The
            number of shares traded was equivalent to about 5.3 times the
            three-month daily average. Inter RAO is the third-worst
            performer on the Micex over the past 12 months, with a drop of
            69 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts, including Nadezhda Timokhova, lifted the
            stock to overweight, citing the shares' underperformance and
            lower valuations in an e-mailed note dated yesterday. Inter RAO
            has declined after being removed from MSCI Inc.'s Russia index
            effective Nov. 27, while the MSCI Russia Utility index has
            slumped 52 percent this year on concern earnings will suffer
            from a tariff freeze imposed by the government next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The overall negative news flow on the electric utilities
            sector this year related to the tariff freeze' resulted in 'a
            considerable correction in utility names,' the JPMorgan
            analysts said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A potential acquisition by state-run OAO Rosneftegaz may
            lead to an improved in dividend policy, according to JPMorgan.
            Inter RAO trades at 4.2 times estimated earnings, which compares
            with 11 times for Enel SpA (ENEL), Italy's largest utility. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Barclays Hires Four Commodities Staff From JPMorgan, Citadel</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) hired three commodities
            directors from JPMorgan Chase Co. last month and an oil trader
            from Citadel LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crude oil trader Thomas Wiktorowski-Schweitz joined from
            Citadel and is based in London, the bank said in an e-mailed
            response to questions today. Rebecca Lee joined as director in
            commodities sales in New York, Phil Hardwick is London-based
            director in energy sales, and Thomas Horn was hired as director
            in commodity-linked finance in Hong Kong. They all worked at
            JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays said in May it was looking to make 'selective'
            hires in commodities after shrinking trading staff last year and
            reining in value-at-risk, an estimate of potential trading
            losses. Barclays tied with New York-based JPMorgan as the
            leading provider of over-the-counter derivatives to companies
            hedging energy and ranked second in hedging metals, a survey
            from Greenwich Associates showed in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue from raw materials at the 10 biggest investment
            banks fell 20 percent in the first half, according to analytics
            company Coalition. JPMorgan generated the most revenue from
            commodities in the first six months this year, followed by
            Goldman Sachs Inc. and Morgan Stanley, it said. JPMorgan plans
            to get out of the business of owning and trading physical
            commodities, it said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is examining legal and regulatory
            exemptions that allow banks to participate in the commodities
            markets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Prosecutors Said to Seek JPMorgan Indictment on Paschi</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Siena prosecutors requested that JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) stand trial for obstructing regulators as
            part of a wider probe into Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA's purchase of Banca Antonveneta SpA,
            according to four people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors allege JPMorgan
            withheld information from regulators about a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) financing the New York-based bank
            arranged for Monte Paschi's takeover of Antonveneta in 2008, said the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the request is not public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan failed to oversee employees properly,
            according to the indictment request, the people said. A judge will review the request at a date that's to be
            determined. Prosecutors also are seeking indictments against former Monte Paschi managers for obstructing
            regulators, as well as market manipulation and falsifying filings, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            should have informed the Bank of Italy that Monte Paschi had guaranteed it against losing money on the bond
            sale, the central bank said in an April 19 letter to prosecutors. The Bank of Italy said it may have
            withheld approval for the deal had it known about the indemnity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'No claim was ever made
            under the indemnity, which only existed for a matter of days, including either for the benefit of JPMorgan
            or any of its employees,' the U.S. bank said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. 'We believe that JPMorgan
            and its employees acted correctly at all times. We will defend this action vigorously.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Unprecedented
            Effort' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monte Paschi bought Antonveneta from Banco Santander SA (SAN) in 2008 for 9
            billion euros, 36 percent more than the Spanish lender paid for the Padua, Italy-based bank two months
            earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, told employees on Sept. 17 to
            prepare for more legal woes while the bank undertakes an 'unprecedented effort' to comply with regulations.
            In the U.S., the lender is in talks to pay about $11 billion by state and federal authorities to end
            investigations into its mortgage-bond sales practices, a person familiar with the discussions said last
            week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Investment Bank Revenues to Fall 18% in Quarter, JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue at the world's biggest
            investment banks may be down 18 percent in the third quarter
            after a drop in their fixed-income, currencies and commodities
            divisions, JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter FICC revenue may decline 24 percent from the
            previous quarter and by 35 percent from the same period last
            year, analysts led by Kian Abouhossein wrote to clients today,
            citing lower trading volume and tighter credit spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equities sales are expected to fall by 13 percent from the
            prior quarter because of low volatility and weak volume in
            equity derivatives. Advisory and underwriting revenue may slip
            by 14 percent, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global investment banks tracked by JPMorgan are Credit
            Suisse Group AG (CSGN), UBS (UBSN) AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc., Morgan Stanley (MS), Barclays Plc (BARC), Societe Generale SA and BNP
            Paribas SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan recommends UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank,
            because of its business mix and Deutsche Bank, which is the
            cheapest among its peers based on price to earnings and price to
            net asset value, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fed Must Give Better Guidance to Market, JPMorgan's Frenkel Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve should give more
            subtle guidance to financial markets rather than pin its policy
            decisions on unpredictable targets, which can send confusing
            signals if these fail to materialize as anticipated, said Jacob Frenkel, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase
            International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markets would benefit from a 'guidance of economic
            realities,' the former governor of the Bank of Israel said at
            the Global Economic Symposium in Kiel, Germany today. 'But you
            have to be very subtle when you go about it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. central bank should also avoid giving dates for
            policy changes such as an end to its bond buying or a change in
            interest rates, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in June he expected the
            bank would complete its bond buying when the jobless level was
            around 7 percent, linking a policy decision to specific
            unemployment rates. Policy makers have pledged since December
            that they won't consider raising interest rates as long as
            unemployment exceeds 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After a decline in August to 7.3 percent for an unexpected
            reason -- Americans giving up on finding work -- the Federal
            Open Market Committee's Sept. 18 decided not to taper its $85
            billion in monthly bond buying, bucking economist predictions
            that it would scale back the purchases that have bolstered
            credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would be very nice to have a guidance of economic
            realities,' Frenkel said. Unemployment is not the right measure
            for guidance as 'U.S. unemployment declined much more
            rapidly than expected by anyone but growth is not generated by
            that as labor force participation shrank.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Confuse Matters &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For a long time the monetary authority decided not to
            discuss exits, as they did not want to confuse matters, but
            let's face it, if you go into a highway, wouldn't you like to
            know before you enter if it is a dead-end or it has an exit,'
            he said at a panel about the future of central banking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central banks must also be freed from the burden of
            'worrisome concerns about financial market stability,' he
            said. To rebalance the situation, the financial industry needs
            to increase banks' capital levels, while lowering their
            leverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Thirdly, liquidity must be higher than it used to be as
            much of the crisis arises when we have a lack of liquidity,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Names McNamer to Oversee Expanded Charitable Giving</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, appointed nonprofit executive Bruce McNamer to run
            its global philanthropic initiatives as the company expands
            charitable giving. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McNamer will oversee all of JPMorgan's donations in newly
            created roles as chief executive officer of the JPMorgan Chase
            Foundation and the corporation's head of global philanthropy,
            the company said in a statement today. He's spent the last nine
            years running TechnoServe, a charitable group that helps build
            farms, businesses and industries in developing countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The private sector needs to step up and do its part to
            address the critical challenges we face,' JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dalila Wilson-Scott, who has run the foundation since the
            beginning of the year, will succeed Kimberly Davis as the
            permanent president of the foundation, the company said. Wilson-Scott came from the corporate merger office
            and served in
            strategic planning'in the'consumer and commercial banking
            businesses, according to the New York-based lender. McNamer and
            Wilson-Scott will report to Peter Scher, who oversees corporate
            responsibility. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Davis left in November, according to a person with direct
            knowledge of the matter who wasn't authorized to comment
            publicly on the departure. She's listed as a managing director
            on the website of Teneo Holdings, a New York consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Chase Foundation announced a partnership last
            week with the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation to finance
            technologies that fight killer diseases in low-income countries.
            Gates founded Microsoft Corp., the software firm. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Commodities Sale to Mercuria Said to Shrink</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd.'s six-month-old agreement to buy JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s physical
            commodities business for $3.5 billion was revised to cover only
            $800 million of assets, according to people familiar with the
            change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to sell the rest of the business in separate
            transactions, said the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the final deal's terms haven't been made public. Some
            separate sales have already been agreed, one person said. The
            Wall Street Journal reported on the changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading houses such as Mercuria are filling the void as
            banks from JPMorgan and Barclays Plc to Deutsche Bank AG and
            Morgan Stanley (MS) withdraw from or scale back physical commodity
            operations amid increased regulatory scrutiny of lenders owning,
            storing and trading raw materials. Founded in 2004 by former
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi,
            Mercuria has grown to become the world's fourth-largest
            independent commodity trader with 2013 revenue of $112 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the assets not being purchased by Mercuria include a
            crude oil supply agreement to a refinery in St. Paul, Minnesota,
            the refinery's owner, Northern Tier Energy LP, said in a
            regulatory filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's physical commodity business, formerly led by
            Blythe Masters, has previously generated annual operating profit
            before compensation costs of $750 million, according to people
            who have seen documents related to the unit's sale. That would
            bring Mercuria, which posted net income of $273 million last
            year, closer to earnings achieved by competitors Vitol Group and
            Trafigura Beheer BV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria competed with Macquarie Group Ltd. and Blackstone
            Group LP to enter exclusive negotiations for the unit in
            February, people with knowledge of the bidding said at the time.
            The JPMorgan unit, put up for sale last year, was slated to give
            Mercuria gas and power trading operations on both sides of the
            Atlantic, physical assets spanning about 40 locations in North
            America and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian
            oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria also gets Henry Bath Sons Ltd., a 220-year-old
            metal-warehouse operator based in Liverpool, England, that will
            be operated as a stand-alone subsidiary separated from
            Mercuria's trading operations. Henry Bath was a founding member
            of the London Metal Exchange, and handles products that include
            aluminum, steel and copper as well as cocoa and coffee,
            according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria, which is registered in Cyprus and has its main
            trading operations in Geneva, offered jobs to about 200 people,
            or about half of the unit's staff, a person familiar with the
            matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Here's What You Need to Know About JPMorgan's Data Breach</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, today described the size of its previously disclosed
            data breach, ranking it among the year's largest-known cyber-attacks. Here's what customers need to know:
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q. How big was the breach? A. JPMorgan estimated that data on 76 million households and
            7 million small businesses were compromised, without identifying locations. For perspective, the U.S. had
            about 115 million households total as of 2012. The breach affected people who visited the firm's websites,
            including Chase.com, or used its mobile app, said a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q.
            What information was taken? A. User contact information including names, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail
            addresses. Internal data identifying customers by category -- such as whether they're clients of the
            mortgage, auto, credit-card or private-bank divisions -- also were exposed, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic:
            Top U.S. Data Breaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. What wasn't taken? A. JPMorgan said there's no evidence hackers
            stole account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Q.
            Are hackers draining accounts, and is my money safe? A. JPMorgan said it hasn't seen any unusual fraud
            linked to the breach. Customers aren't liable for unauthorized transactions if the bank is promptly alerted,
            the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internet Security&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q. What should I do to protect
            myself? A. Because account IDs and passwords weren't compromised, JPMorgan said it isn't necessary to obtain
            new credit or debit cards, change passwords or obtain identity or credit monitoring as a result of the
            incident. The firm said customers should alert it immediately if they spot suspicious transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Q. What can hackers do with contact information? A. Phishing scams are typically the biggest risk,
            according to JPMorgan. That's when criminals contact people and try to trick them into handing over account
            details or other sensitive information. The bank warned customers not to click links or download attachments
            on e-mails from unknown senders and to be wary of other suspicious communications. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Employee Password Was Key in Hack Hitting 76 Million Homes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank, said a previously disclosed data breach affected 76
            million households and 7 million small businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customer names, addresses, phone
            numbers and e-mail addresses were taken, the New York-based bank said today in a regulatory filing. Hackers
            also obtained internal data identifying customers by category, such as whether they are clients of the
            private-bank, mortgage, auto or credit-card divisions, said a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            breach affected anyone who visited the company's websites, including Chase.com, or used its mobile app, said
            the person, who requested anonymity because that information wasn't publicly disclosed. Some of those
            affected by the incursion are former clients of JPMorgan, which currently has 65 million customers and
            reaches half of all U.S. households, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Graphic: Top U.S. Data Breaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            bank, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, hasn't detected 'any unusual customer fraud' related to
            the attack, and clients aren't liable for unauthorized transactions that are promptly reported to the
            company, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There is no evidence that account information for
            such affected customers -' account numbers, passwords, user IDs, dates of birth or Social Security numbers
            '- was compromised during this attack,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mercuria Said to Hire One JPMorgan Metals Trader as Deal Shrinks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. is hiring
            just one JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) metals trader as the Swiss trading
            house pares back its purchase of the New York-based bank's
            commodity unit, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Berchole will trade aluminum, nickel and tin for
            Mercuria in London, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified because the matter is private. Mercuria will pay
            about $800 million for part of the JPMorgan assets, less than
            the $3.5 billion cited by the bank when it announced the deal
            for the whole unit in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Mercuria won't buy most of JPMorgan's metals business
            and inventories or its two crude-supply contracts for U.S.
            refineries, the bank still expects to recoup $3.5 billion for
            the commodities unit by selling assets to other parties, two
            people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under pressure from regulators concerned about lenders
            owning, storing and trading raw materials, banks including
            JPMorgan, Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG are withdrawing from
            or scaling back their commodity businesses. Independent trading
            houses such as Mercuria, which have less direct oversight by
            regulators, are filling the void. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria last month hired former Trafigura Beheer BV
            executive Tristan Busch to run its refined metals and
            concentrates business from Geneva. The company is looking to add
            copper traders in North America and Europe, one of the people
            said. The trading house's metals business in China is managed by
            James Jian Wu. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Crude Contracts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's contract to supply crude oil to the Philadelphia
            Energy Solutions refinery in Pennsylvania won't be transferred
            to Mercuria, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A separate crude-supply agreement to a refinery in St.
            Paul, Minnesota, also won't go to Mercuria, the plant's owner,
            Northern Tier Energy LP, said in a regulatory filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria will secure JPMorgan's gas and power trading
            operations in North American and Europe, the assets it most
            covets, one of the people said. It will also buy more than a
            dozen physical assets in North America, including about 6
            million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian oil sands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria, which has its main trading operations in Geneva,
            also gets Henry Bath Sons Ltd., a 220-year-old metal-warehouse
            operator based in Liverpool, England, which will be operated as
            a stand-alone subsidiary. Henry Bath was a founding member of
            the London Metal Exchange, and handles products that include
            aluminum, steel and copper as well as cocoa and coffee,
            according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Said to Relinquish Chairman Title at Bank Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon stepped down as chairman of the lender's
            main bank subsidiary at the start of July, according to a person
            briefed on the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon, who serves as CEO and chairman of the parent
            company, handed off his post at the unit to William C. Weldon, a
            JPMorgan board member and former head of Johnson Johnson (JNJ), said
            the person, who asked not to be named because details of the
            move weren't announced. A regulatory document released yesterday
            listed Dimon as 'chairman emeritus' of the subsidiary, which
            runs JPMorgan's deposit and consumer banking operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sought to bolster corporate governance and
            rebuild its relationship with watchdogs after probes by
            regulators and a Senate panel faulted the firm for withholding
            information from U.S. overseers during trading losses last year.
            Dimon handed off the chairman title at the unit after company
            attorneys recommended it for technical reasons, rather than
            because of pressure from regulators or investors, said the
            person, who's familiar with the bank's thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
            Dimon's status as chairman emeritus at the unit was disclosed in
            JPMorgan's annual 'living will,' describing to regulators how
            the New York-based firm could be wound down in an emergency. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pandora Gains as JPMorgan Sees Cash Returns: Copenhagen Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora A/S (PNDORA) rose the most among
            Copenhagen's benchmark stocks today after JPMorgan Chase Co.
            said the Nordic region's biggest jewelry maker may increase cash
            returns to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora rose as much as 2.3 percent to 241.20 kroner,
            making the stock the biggest winner in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen
            20 index. (KFX) The shares traded 2 percent higher at 10:04 a.m. in
            the Danish capital, with volume at 28 percent of the three-month
            daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora on July 30 raised its 2013 revenue and profit
            forecasts and two weeks later reported second-quarter net income
            that beat analyst estimates as sales of its charms soared.
            JPMorgan said today that third-quarter earnings, due Nov. 12,
            could be a 'further catalyst to the stock' and repeated its
            overweight recommendation on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora's earnings report will confirm 'the strong top-line momentum and solid profitability
            profile,' Chiara Battistini, a JPMorgan analyst, said in a note. 'In addition,
            in light of the robust cash flow generation and capital
            structure policy in place, we deem the potential cash returns
            particularly compelling.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora, based in Glostrup, Denmark, may report third-quarter net income of 417 million kroner
            ($75.9 million),
            according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five
            analysts. That compares with net income of 380 million kroner a
            year earlier. The company has beat analyst net income estimates
            in 10 of the last 11 quarters, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investor concern that Pandora's biggest owners, including
            private-equity company Axcel, may sell a large stake could
            pressure the share 'in coming weeks,' Battistini said. 'We
            would see any stock weakness and/or pull-back post placement as
            an attractive entry point,' the analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mortgage-Investor Concerns Revive Amid JPMorgan Settlement Talks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A group of mortgage-bond investors
            urged U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder not to let banks saddle
            them with costs by pledging relief for borrowers to settle U.S.
            investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Association of Mortgage Investors, representing mutual
            funds and pensions, wrote a letter Oct. 7 to Holder after
            reports that JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) discussed settling government
            probes for $11 billion, including consumer relief. The letter,
            which doesn't mention the firm, asks that the group be included
            in talks with banks to ensure costs from the settlement aren't
            passed to buyers of the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We stand firmly behind the principle that parties sued by
            the government or third-parties should not be able to settle
            with assets that they do not own, namely other people's money,'
            the group wrote. 'We urge that any settlement must not allow
            bank-servicers to meet their obligations by using mortgages
            managed by them but which they do not 100 percent own.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage-securities investors have criticized banks'
            previous settlements, saying that efforts to ease homeowners'
            burden can lower the value the instruments. The terms and size
            of New York-based JPMorgan's potential settlement changed
            repeatedly during talks last month, a person familiar with the
            matter said at the time. No deal has been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on the letter late
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Taps Taxpayer-Backed Banks for Bailout Rules</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, is using cheap funding from government-chartered
            institutions to meet new regulations designed to ensure it won't
            need a taxpayer bailout in any future crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank borrowed almost $20 billion in the first half of
            the year from Federal Home Loan Banks, according to filings,
            almost as much as it got from selling dollar-denominated bonds
            in 2013. New York-based JPMorgan, with $2.4 trillion of assets,
            obtained most of the loans from the Federal Home Loan Bank of
            Cincinnati, whose 740 members typically resemble the $139
            million-asset Bank of McCreary County in Kentucky and $40
            million-asset Rural Cooperatives Credit Union. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Set up during the Great Depression to help community
            lenders, FHLBs raise cash by selling bonds viewed by rating
            companies and investors as backed by the U.S. government.
            Lending by the Congressionally chartered banks is climbing at
            the fastest pace since the start of the financial crisis in
            2007. The growth has little to do with most of the 7,600 banks,
            thrifts, credit unions and insurers that are members. Without
            JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the three
            largest borrowers, lending by the FHLBs would be shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;With the deadline for avoiding a
            U.S. default looming, investors from Boston to Bangalore are
            moving to cash, extending the maturities of their short-term
            Treasury holdings and buying options to help protect themselves
            should stock and bond prices tumble. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) private bank clients are raising
            cash while others are dumping Treasury bills with maturities
            beyond the Oct. 17 debt ceiling deadline for longer-dated bonds.
            Stewart Capital Advisors LLC in Indiana, Pennsylvania, favors
            insurance companies, technology stocks and health-care
            providers, which now have lower valuations. Money is flowing out
            of an exchange-traded fund that tracks American banks and into
            overseas equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While most investors say a default will be averted, the
            potential for calamity should political leaders fail to renew
            U.S. borrowing authority before it runs out is moving some to
            take measures to safeguard their assets. A Treasury Department
            report on Oct. 3 said consequences would be 'catastrophic'
            should the U.S. fail to make payments, including higher interest
            rates, lower investment and slow growth for decades to come. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We want to protect capital first,' said Kevin Kearns, a
            fixed-income portfolio manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles
            Co., which manages $188 billion. While Loomis is forecasting
            that a default will be avoided, the back-and-forth negotiations
            may provoke some investors to sell assets. 'We have our
            shopping list ready if things go on sale,' Kearns said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long Short &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kearns oversees $1.4 billion in a strategy known as long-short, where an investor can speculate on
            a security's price
            either rising or falling. The Standard Poor's 500 Index jumped
            2.2 percent to 1,692.56 at 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stocks rallied as U.S. House Republican leaders embraced a
            possible short-term deal to avoid default. The lawmakers will
            present their members with a proposal to raise the debt limit
            for six weeks without policy conditions, a congressional aide
            familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The House wants to 'offer the president today the ability
            to move' and ask 'for his willingness to sit down and discuss
            with us a way forward,' Speaker John Boehner said today to
            reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETF Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors withdrew $4 billion from ETFs that track U.S
            equities between Oct. 3 and 8, data compiled by Bloomberg on
            fund flows show. At the same time, they added $418 million to
            the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF, which buys European, Australian and
            Israeli shares, the most for any ETF tracked by Bloomberg. The
            Vanguard FTSE Europe fund got $385 million, the second most. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, investors withdrew $780 million from the
            Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund tracking financial companies
            in the SP 500, the most since April 2010, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
            Index, used to hedge against stock swings, saw record volume of
            1.78 million contracts on Oct. 8. Traders bought almost double
            the number of calls to buy compared with puts to sell that day,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. Owning bullish options on the
            VIX, as the index is known, can offset losses when stocks drop
            because they become more valuable as price swings widen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Last Minute &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most investors have yet to become concerned that the debt
            ceiling will be breached, citing the last-minute resolution of
            the August 2011 showdown as a model that shows a deal will be
            achieved in time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'None of my investors have so far called me to say 'I want
            out,' or ask 'Is this really a crisis situation?'' Jim Paulsen,
            the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells
            Capital Management, which oversees about $340 billion, said in a
            telephone interview. 'The American psyche is in much better
            position today. They don't look at every issue as Armageddon.
            It's just another problem. They are not rushing to gold or U.S.
            Treasuries or to the dollar.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 41 percent of investors in a TD Ameritrade Holding
            Corp. survey said they haven't made changes to their investments
            as a result of the government shutdown that began Oct. 1 or a
            possible default. Twelve percent said they're 'taking advantage
            of opportunities,' and 10 percent said they've moved into cash
            in the immediate term, according to the poll of 693 consumers
            conducted Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Treasury Bills &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Concern that a default might happen is starting to show up
            in the market for short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasury bill rates rose after President Barack Obama
            rejected calls Oct. 8 to invoke the Constitution's 14th
            Amendment to skirt Congressional approval for issuing new debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rates on Treasury bills due on Oct. 17 fell 17 basis
            points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 0.31 percent at 5 p.m. New
            York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched
            0.51 percent earlier, the highest level since they were sold in
            October 2012. The yield was negative as recently as Sept. 26.
            The rate on bills maturing on Nov. 14 rose as high as 0.275
            percent yesterday, compared with 0.02 percent on Sept. 30. Rates
            on bills due Nov. 21 rose eight basis points to 0.12 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some investors have been 'rolling out those Treasury bills
            to future maturities' in December and into 2014, Megan McClellan, head of U.S. fixed income at JPMorgan
            Private Bank in
            New York, said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday.
            'For people that are nervous, rolling forward is OK, and also
            going to cash. We have seen, as we saw in 2011, some percentage
            going to deposits.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Money Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money-market mutual funds can cope with a short-term
            default in U.S. Treasuries as long as it doesn't trigger the
            kind of investor run that followed the collapse of Lehman
            Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, according to Fitch Ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The funds have high levels of short-term liquidity and have
            reduced their holdings of Treasuries that would be most
            immediately affected by the failure of the U.S. to extend its
            borrowing capacity, the ratings company said yesterday in a
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have avoided maturities in the time period toward the
            end of October,' Nancy Prior, head of money funds at Boston-based Fidelity Investments, said in an
            interview. Fidelity is
            the largest manager of U.S. money funds with $427 billion in
            assets as of Aug. 31, according to Crane Data LLC in
            Westborough, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Borrowing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market for corporate borrowing through IOUs expanded to
            the highest level in eight months as investors turned to
            alternatives to short-term Treasury bills amid the impasse over
            raising the U.S. debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
            outstanding climbed $11 billion to $1.066 trillion in the week
            ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
            That's the highest level since the market touched $1.085
            trillion for the period ended Feb. 13, according to Fed data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Fidelity has sought to avoid Treasury bills maturing
            near the deadline, Pacific Investment Management Co. has been
            buying them as their yields have risen, said co-chief investment
            officer Bill Gross, manager of the world's largest bond fund at
            Pacific Management Investment Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Their selling begets opportunistic buying on the part of
            Pimco,' Gross said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
            'We're picking up pennies on the street. This is a particular
            penny that we think is risk-free.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Equities Collars &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong's futures and options market operator, Hong Kong
            Exchanges Clearing Ltd., increased the discount on Treasury
            bills used as collateral for margin requirements today, citing
            concern that the U.S. is at risk of a default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Japan, investors sold 2.2 trillion yen ($22.5 billion)
            of foreign bonds in the week ended Oct. 4, the most on record,
            according to figures released by the Ministry of Finance in
            Tokyo. The report didn't reveal the amount of Treasuries sold by
            the Japanese bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist for Janney
            Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia, the dip in stock prices
            may become a chance to increase his ownership of U.S. equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Where we are holding significant cash we have been
            nibbling,' Luschini said in an e-mail response to questions on
            Oct. 9. He added to his equity positions as the SP 500 fell to
            1,660 and 'we will buy more aggressively if we near 1,600, all
            things being equal.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;VIX Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors who are concerned about a default should use an
            options strategy known as a collar on their largest or most
            volatile equity holdings, according to Randy Frederick, managing
            director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab
            Corp. in Austin, Texas. To implement the trade, investors buy a
            put, or option to sell, with an exercise price below the current
            stock level, financed by selling call options with a higher
            strike price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Randall Warren, chief investment officer of Warren
            Financial Service, purchased options on the VIX as protection
            against surging stock volatility if the U.S. defaults on its
            debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Warren said he bought calls that become profitable if the
            VIX rises 12 percent to 22 by Oct. 16, the day before U.S.
            borrowing authority lapses. He also purchased calls with a 32
            strike price for October to protect against bigger swings in the
            equity market, as well as 22 and 32 contracts that expire in
            November as a hedge if the talks are extended. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Buying these options very, very cheaply and getting the
            explosive upside if something serious does occur with the
            markets, then that is a way to hedge your bets without a whole
            lot of money,' Warren, who oversees about $100 million, said in
            a phone interview from Exton, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Worst Case' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has gained 0.7 percent since the U.S.
            government shut down last week. The VIX slid 0.7 percent to
            16.48 over the same period, as a 16 percent tumble today erased
            an advance to as high as 20.34 on Oct. 8. That compares to a
            level of 48 when SP cut the U.S. debt rating in August 2011,
            the highest since before the bull market started in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Supreeth S.M., the Bangalore-based chief executive officer
            at Quant First Asset Advisors India, bought put options on the
            nation's CNX Nifty Index stock gauge with an exercise price 10
            percent below the index level to protect against the 'worst
            case scenario' of a U.S. default. He's funding the trade by
            selling call options on the measure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A U.S. default is highly unlikely as we expect lawmakers
            to come around to avert a disaster,' Supreeth, whose firm
            manages about $100 million in options, said in a phone interview
            on Oct. 8. 'However, something bad may happen and we are
            advising clients to hedge.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Puts with a strike price 10 percent below the Nifty cost
            8.2 points more than calls betting on a 10 percent gain on Oct.
            8, the least since Sept. 19, one-month implied volatility data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. The Indian stock index, which has
            climbed 2 percent this year, tumbled 26 percent in October 2008,
            the month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
            bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Treasury Hedges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS Global Asset Management, a money manager that oversees
            $644 billion, said it has bought Treasury options to hedge
            against the U.S. defaulting should politicians fail to agree on
            raising the nation's debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company bought two-year Treasury puts and sold those on
            German two-year note futures to mitigate the risk, according to
            Brian Fehrenbach, the company's Chicago-based co-head of U.S.
            multi-sector fixed income. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's part of our defensive strategy and it's something
            we hope will not be tested,' Fehrenbach, a former derivatives
            trader, said in an interview in London. 'The uncertainty in
            Washington doesn't promote confidence. The longer they go
            without a resolution, the more risk there is for a last-minute
            mistake.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Money Funds Sold Default-Threatened Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the second-biggest provider of U.S. money-market mutual funds, said those
            products had divested of U.S. Treasuries that mature between
            Oct. 16 and Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said it took the action, which also applies to
            funds with scheduled coupon payments during the period, to help
            maintain the products' stable $1 a share value. The funds have
            also increased their levels of liquidity, the New York-based
            company said today in a statement, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Although JPMorgan Investment Management continues to
            believe that the probability of a U.S. government default is
            low, it has taken certain precautionary measures with respect to
            the money markets,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;House Speaker John Boehner today proposed a plan that would
            push the limit for U.S. borrowing to Nov. 22 from Oct. 17. The
            White House endorsed the short debt-limit increase with no
            policy conditions attached. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
            warned that 'uncertainty' over the debt limit is starting to
            stress financial markets, speaking in testimony to the Senate
            Finance Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. money funds held about $475 billion in Treasury
            securities as of Aug. 31, and an additional $156 billion in
            repurchase agreements collateralized by Treasuries, according to
            research firm Crane Data LLC in Westborough, Massachusetts.
            About $74 billion in Treasuries held by money funds matures from
            Oct. 24 to Nov. 15, Crane Data estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fitch Report &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money funds can cope with a short-term default in U.S.
            Treasuries as long as it doesn't trigger the kind of investor
            run that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
            in 2008, Fitch Ratings said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fitch based its conclusion partly on evidence that fund
            companies had reduced holdings in maturities most likely to be
            affected by a default and had boosted the level of assets that
            could be quickly converted into cash and returned to withdrawing
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Institutional investors in money-market mutual funds that
            focus almost exclusively on Treasury securities and other debt
            backed by the U.S. government withdrew $17.5 billion in the
            seven days through yesterday, according to Crane Data. That's
            about 2.6 percent of assets in those funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based company that is the
            largest U.S. money-fund manager, said earlier this week that it
            had moved out of Treasuries maturing in late October and early
            November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fund provider Federated Investors Inc. (FII), based in
            Pittsburgh, said it wasn't avoiding that time period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'No Threat' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to hold Treasury securities that mature in
            the upcoming weeks and are confident that they represent no
            threat to the liquidity or stability of the portfolio,' Meghan McAndrews, a Federated spokeswoman, said
            today in an e-mailed
            statement. 'We believe that, at the end of the day, the parties
            in this conflict will come to a resolution that will prevent the
            U.S. government from defaulting on its obligations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vanguard Group Inc., the Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based
            fund company, doesn't expect a default, Chief Executive Officer
            William McNabb said today in an interview on Bloomberg
            Television. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Within the walls of Vanguard, we continue to be
            optimistic about cooler heads prevailing,' McNabb said. 'The
            idea that the U.S. would actually default on Treasuries seems
            almost unfathomable to us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Funding Standoff &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Republican lawmakers in Washington had vowed not to approve
            an increase in the government's debt limit unless President
            Barack Obama and his Democratic Party agree to change the
            Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, known as
            Obamacare. They have also refused to approve new funding for
            government operations, triggering a partial government shutdown
            since Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money-market funds give millions of households, companies
            and other institutions a safe parking spot for cash and channel
            $2.6 trillion to issuers of short-term debt including the U.S.
            government, financial institutions and companies. A run on funds
            that hold corporate debt after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
            in September 2008 helped freeze global credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>India in Talks With JPMorgan to Join Bond Indexes, Reuters Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Indian policy makers are in talks
            with JPMorgan Chase Co. and other companies for inclusion of
            the nation's debt in bond indexes to boost capital inflows,
            Reuters reported. The rupee surged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram and other
            officials plan meetings in the U.S. next week with fund managers
            including Pacific Investment Management Co. and Standard Life
            Plc, Reuters said without naming its sources. India may ease
            some restrictions on foreign purchases of its debt if necessary
            for inclusion, the report said. Reserve Bank of India Governor
            Raghuram Rajan said on Sept. 20 that talks would be held with
            index providers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An opening up of the bond market will lead to inflows,'
            said Paresh Nayar, head of currency and money markets at
            FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. 'There is an expectation that some
            real developments are now happening after Rajan had flagged the
            possibility earlier.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lombard Odier Investment Management and Aletti Gestielle
            Sgr SpA say India needs to remove all restrictions in its bond
            market, and Standard Chartered Plc estimates that inclusion in
            JPMorgan's GBI-Global Diversified Index could lure as much as
            $40 billion over 12 months. India caps foreign purchases of
            local-currency debt at $81 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan 'cannot comment on market speculation,' Mumbai-based spokeswoman Beverly Mathews said in
            an e-mailed reply to
            Bloomberg. E-mails sent to the media teams at Pimco and Standard
            Life didn't immediately get a response. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The potential meetings follow the announcement yesterday
            that International Finance Corp., the World Bank's investment
            arm, plans to sell a record $1 billion of rupee bonds offshore
            to fund its investments. The move 'should support investor
            confidence further,' Citigroup Inc. strategist Gaurav Garg
            wrote in a research report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas funds have cut holdings of rupee-denominated bonds
            to $25.9 billion as of Oct. 9, official data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee rose 0.9 percent today, reversing a drop of as
            much as 0.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            The currency is still 10.4 percent weaker this year, weighed
            down by a current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Shrinks Investment Bank Compensation Pool 4.4%</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and
            investment bank allocated 4.4 percent less for employee
            compensation in the first nine months of the year as the
            division's revenue climbed 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit's $8.69 billion in compensation fell to 31 percent
            of revenue, excluding accounting adjustments, from 34 percent in
            the same period of 2012, according to figures posted today on
            the New York-based firm's website. The amount equals $165,774
            for each of the division's 52,445 employees. The unit employed
            52,226 people a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, combined its
            investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and
            securities-services units last year under co-heads Mike Cavanagh, 47, and Daniel Pinto, 50. The group has
            more than
            twice as many employees as the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
            years. Figures for average pay don't represent what individuals
            actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
            compensation expense by the number of employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We really believe in pay for performance,' Cavanagh told
            shareholders in February. JPMorgan's scale can help keep the
            compensation-to-revenue ratio low while offering top employees
            pay at least as good as competitors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. lender, said it will halt clearing services for about 500
            foreign banks and discontinue checking accounts for
            'politically exposed persons' in other nations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes are part of a strategy of 'de-risking through
            client selection,' the New York-based bank said today in a

        <headline>Dimon Says JPMorgan Doing 'Very Little' Repurchasing of Shares</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), which today
            reported its first loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, said it has scaled back stock
            repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank repurchased $739.7 million of shares in the third
            quarter, down from $1.17 billion in the three months ended June
            30 and $2.58 billion in the first quarter, according to a
            supplemental filing posted on the New York-based lender's
            website today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're doing very little stock buyback right now,' Dimon
            said today on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said
            last month that the lender could be forced to halt its $6
            billion repurchase program as fines and penalties on the bank
            grow. The third-quarter loss was fueled by a $7.2 billion charge
            tied to litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank executives were asked today about the possibility of
            litigation expenses affecting capital plans submitted to
            regulators or altering the pace of share repurchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't expect or believe that there should be any
            repercussions, but they're ultimately up to the regulators'
            decisions,' Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan suspended a $15 billion buyback plan last year to
            boost capital levels after a bet on credit derivatives in London
            that ultimately cost the firm more than $6.2 billion. Dimon in
            March won conditional Federal Reserve approval for $6 billion in
            buybacks. The Fed required the company to 'address weaknesses'
            in its planning process. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Posts First Loss on $7.2 Billion Legal Cost</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. reported its first loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon after taking a
            $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            third-quarter loss was $380 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a profit of $5.71 billion, or $1.40,
            a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. The last time the bank failed to
            report a profit was the second quarter of 2004, when William Harrison was CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Over the
            last few weeks the environment has become highly charged and very volatile,' Chief Financial Officer
            Marianne Lake said on a conference call. 'Things have been very fluid and the situation escalated to the
            point where we are facing very large premiums and penalties, the level of which have gone far beyond what we
            reasonably expected.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, who led JPMorgan to record earnings in each of the past
            three years, is grappling with regulatory investigations and tightening internal controls following a
            trading loss last year of more than $6.2 billion. The legal costs contributed to a 54 percent surge in
            non-interest expenses to $23.6 billion, as revenue dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Very
            Painful' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is very painful for the company,' Dimon told analysts on the call.
            JPMorgan has spent $8 billion on litigation and set aside $20 billion toward legal and regulatory costs
            since January 2010. Those expenses will remain elevated for the next year or two, according to Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Dimon Joins Jain Warning U.S. Against Default</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lawmakers shouldn't risk a default
            on U.S. debt because the impact would be devastating and the
            full extent of the damage isn't knowable in advance, said the
            heads of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The United States cannot default and, in my opinion, will
            not default,' JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said
            today during a panel discussion at a financial industry
            conference in Washington. 'It would ripple through the global
            economy in a way you couldn't possibly understand.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The economy has been gaining strength and a default now
            could reverse that progress, Dimon said. 'Please, let's not
            shoot ourselves in the foot,' he said. Deutsche Bank co-CEO
            Anshu Jain called the prospect of even a small default 'utterly
            catastrophic.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CEOs spoke while U.S. lawmakers struggled without
            success to reach an agreement that would avert default and end
            the 12-day government shutdown. The Senate rejected a Democratic
            plan to push the debt-limit fight into 2015. The U.S. might not
            be able to pay all its bills as early as Oct. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There isn't life beyond default,' Jain said during the
            panel discussion with Dimon. 'This would be a very rapidly
            spreading, fatal disease.' The potential consequences are so
            unfathomable that Jain said he couldn't offer the audience any
            meaningful recommendations on how to react. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Financial Foundations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Europe was paralyzed at the possibility of an Italian
            default, which was a 2 trillion Euro economy,' Jain said,
            referring to the continent's debt crisis. A U.S. default would
            be far worse with incurable legal problems, he said. 'You're
            now talking about the underpinnings of finance,' Jain said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank by assets and based in
            New York. Deutsche Bank, based in Frankfurt, is the biggest in
            Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The consequences of it would be absolutely disastrous,
            considering the role of the U.S. dollar,' said Baudouin Prot,
            chairman of Paris-based BNP Paribas SA, at today's event. 'I
            don't believe for one second that this scenario will occur.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even as default looms, Jain said the dollar's status as the
            world's reserve currency is here to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's no alternative,' and there won't be one for at
            least decade, he said. Jain said he would have liked to have
            seen the euro occupy more of that role. 'The European crisis
            over the last two or three years has set that back,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Buenaventura Advances as JPMorgan Says Buy on Outlook for Mines</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA,
            Latin America's biggest gold producer, climbed to a two-week
            high in New York after JPMorgan Chase Co. recommended the
            stock and said output will recover in 2015 after declines this
            year and next. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buenaventura's American depositary receipts advanced 3.2
            percent to $12.14 at 3:24 p.m. in New York, the highest level on
            a closing basis since Sept. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts estimated in a note to clients that gold
            production will rise to 914,000 ounces in 2015 after falling
            this year to 883,000 ounces from 1.03 million ounces in 2012.
            Buenaventura is expected to resolve operational difficulties at
            its mines, and its partly owned Yanacocha mine will receive
            authorization to develop new reserves, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see the problems at its mines as short-term,'
            analysts John Bridges and Anant Inani said in the note today.
            Authorities in the Peruvian department of Cajamarca, where the
            Yanacocha mine is located, will encourage development of new
            mining areas 'rather than risk losing Yanacocha's jobs.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ADRs may reach $19 by the end of 2014, JPMorgan said.
            The analysts expect output of 855,000 ounces next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Newmont Mining Corp., Yamacocha's majority owner, rose 0.3
            percent to $25.69 today in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buenaventura's ADRs have tumbled 66 percent this year as
            operating problems at its Orcopampa and other smaller mines
            reduced output, JPMorgan said in its report. Expansion of
            Yanacocha has faced opposition from local community groups on
            water-supply issues, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells First Note Tied to BBVA, With Five Times Leverage</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) sold $5.12
            million of two-year notes that yield five times Banco Bilbao
            Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)'s gains, the first offering linked to the
            lender since at least January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Oct. 8, pay a maximum of 40 percent
            with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with
            the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. JPMorgan valued the
            notes at 95 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York,
            declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BBVA, Spain's second-biggest bank, issued $1.5 billion of
            contingent convertible bonds in April, the first European bank
            to sell the securities complying with new rules governing how
            they can be employed to bolster balance sheets. The bank is
            using the proceeds for its Tier 1 capital, the riskiest segment.
            The bonds automatically convert to stock if the bank's Tier 1
            ratio falls below 5.125 percent of assets weighted by risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bilbao-based bank rose 28 percent this year to 8.94
            euros ($12.14) at the close of trading in Madrid today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on U.S.
            SEC-registered structured notes in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create the securities by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-RBS Trader in U.K. Probe Said to Be JPMorgan's Usher</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Usher, JPMorgan Chase
            Co.'s (JPM) chief dealer in London, wrote instant messages while he
            was at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc that U.K. regulators are
            scrutinizing as part of their investigation of alleged currency
            manipulation, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The messages to traders at other firms included details of
            his trading positions, said one of the people, who asked not to
            be identified because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.
            The spot currency trader left Edinburgh-based RBS in 2010, and
            his departure was unrelated to the probe, the person said. The
            regulator's review doesn't imply wrongdoing on Usher's part, the
            other person said. The people didn't say how many other traders'
            communications are being scrutinized. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorities are scrutinizing electronic messages used by
            currency traders as part of an investigation of potential
            manipulation of the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market,
            according to a person with knowledge of the talks. The U.K.'s
            Financial Conduct Authority is focusing on trading around the
            so-called WM/Reuters rates, benchmarks used to value trillions
            of dollars of investments, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in June that traders at some banks
            may have pooled information about their positions through
            instant messages and sought to manipulate the WM/Reuters rates
            for profit by pushing through trades before and during the 60-second windows when the benchmarks are set.
            RBS, Britain's
            biggest publicly owned lender, opened an internal inquiry and
            uncovered the transcripts after the report, one of the people
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) Investment Management
            told clients its money-market funds aren't holding Treasuries
            that mature in the next month as Congress debates whether to
            raise the U.S. debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's money-market portfolios don't own Treasuries
            that mature between tomorrow and Nov. 20, the Morgan Stanley
            unit said in its Investor Insights publication for this month.
            The prime portfolios have no Treasury exposure, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our portfolio management team has taken a conservative
            stance on U.S. Treasury bills and notes in anticipation of
            congressional gridlock around raising the debt ceiling,' the
            firm wrote. 'We felt it prudent to avoid the potential price
            volatility near the estimated deadline as well as eliminate any
            possible need to sell those securities later at potentially less
            favorable prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the second-biggest provider of U.S.
            money-market mutual funds, said last week that those products
            had divested Treasuries that mature between Oct. 16 and Nov. 6.
            Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based company that is the
            largest U.S. money-fund manager, also said it had moved out of
            Treasuries maturing in late October and early November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $100 Million Fine on CFTC London Whale Claim</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the largest U.S. bank, agreed to pay $100 million to resolve Commodity Futures
            Trading Commission claims that the company's London traders last year deployed a reckless strategy in
            derivatives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord, which stems from the bank's chief investment office's conduct
            on Feb. 29, 2012, brings JPMorgan's settlements from the London Whale trades to more than $1 billion, the
            CFTC said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's traders tried to defend their position in
            credit derivatives 'by dumping a gargantuan, record-setting, volume of swaps virtually all at once,
            recklessly ignoring the obvious dangers to legitimate pricing forces,' David Meister, the CFTC's head of
            enforcement, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank agreed in September to pay
            $920 million to resolve related U.S. and U.K. probes into its internal controls and handling of the trades,
            which inflicted at least $6.2 billion in losses on the bank last year. The accords don't end all of the
            investigations into the bets managed by Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale because his
            positions were large enough to move markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The selling cited by the CFTC was a
            'manipulative device' that disregarded consequences to the broader market, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe
            Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said the bank neither admitted nor denied the CFTC's legal conclusion
            that there was a violation, while admitting to 'certain facts set out in the order.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Middle
            Ground &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The admission of the facts represents a middle ground between settlements where
            a party neither admits nor denies anything and those where a party admits to a violation of the law, Dan
            Waldman, a Washington-based partner at law firm Arnold Porter LLP, said in a telephone interview. The accord
            preserves the bank's ability to defend against future civil claims related to the London trades, he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The London Whale in a Nutshell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It does make it easier for them to
            defend future cases,' said Waldman, a former CFTC general counsel who represents exchanges, brokerages and
            investment funds in regulatory matters before his former agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The accord following the CFTC's 17-month investigation relies on Dodd-Frank Act powers
            to combat market manipulation. The 2010 financial-regulatory law broadened the agency's ability to bring
            enforcement cases, allowing lawyers to demonstrate reckless trading instead of a higher standard of intent
            and success at actual manipulation of a market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Defending Position &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan
            traders on Feb. 29, 2012, tried to defend their position in credit-default swaps to stem losses, according
            to the CFTC. The bank sold more than $7 billion of swaps that day, including $4.6 billion in a three-hour
            period, the agency said. The sales accounted for more than 90 percent of the day's net volume traded by the
            entire market, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The facts as admitted by the bank are that they acted
            recklessly with regard to the fundamental precept that prices in the swap market be established by
            legitimate forces of supply and demand,' CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bart Chilton, a Democratic CFTC commissioner, said in a statement that he wouldn't have supported
            the order without the bank's admission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;O'Malia Dissent &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scott
            O'Malia, a Republican commissioner, dissented from the decision and said the agency should have taken more
            time to demonstrate whether the bank is liable for price manipulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The commission's
            abbreviated investigation has failed to determine whether JPMorgan intentionally or recklessly manipulated
            the price of a particular type of credit default swap index,' O'Malia said in his statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Securities and Exchange Commission has said its inquiry remains open while the U.S. Justice Department runs
            a parallel probe. Iksil, who prosecutors have said is cooperating with their case, hasn't been charged. The
            CFTC's enforcement division decided against recommending an enforcement against against JPMorgan traders,
            according to the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April last year, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            initially dismissed reports that the derivatives bets were distorting markets, calling the attention a
            'tempest in a teapot.' The bank disclosed mounting losses a month later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank
            admitted in its SEC settlement that internal oversight of the trades suffered from lapses and that the firm
            violated federal securities laws. The company's handling of the trades also has been faulted by Senate
            investigators, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and U.K. Financial
            Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Resolving Probes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sought in the
            past few months to resolve probes into businesses including energy trading, credit-card lending and bundling
            of mortgages into bonds. The bank said Oct. 11 it took a $7.2 billion charge for expenses tied to regulatory
            matters and litigation, leading to its first quarterly loss during Dimon's tenure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            company has yet to resolve state and federal probes into its mortgage-bond sales, including a criminal
            inquiry. JPMorgan has been discussing a potential $11 billion deal with authorities looking into that
            business, a person with knowledge of the talks said in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;North Asia stocks to benefit from
            improving U.S. economy as they're generally more export
            oriented, Grace Tam, a Hong Kong-based global market strategist
            at JPMorgan Asset, said in a briefing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;* Pick-up in global recovery to boost markets in S. Korea and
            Taiwan, Tam says
            * Emerging market and Asia dividend stocks, which have non-defensive characteristics, may outperform in
            rising interest-rate environment because higher rates reflect better economy,
            Tam says
            * Developed markets have better economic, earnings growth
            momentum vs. emerging markets in short term, Tam says
            * Japan economic data shows Abenomics is working; 2020 Olympics

        <headline>JPMorgan Sells Chase Manhattan Plaza in NYC to China's Fosun</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has agreed to
            sell 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the tower built by David Rockefeller, to Fosun International Ltd., the
            investment arm of
            China's biggest closely held industrial group, for $725 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fosun, which invests in properties, pharmaceuticals and
            steel, is buying the 60-story, 2.2 million square-foot, lower
            Manhattan tower, according to a statement it filed to Hong
            Kong's stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's developers and companies are expanding in overseas
            property markets as the government maintains curbs on housing at
            home to cool prices. Greenland Holding Group Co., a Shanghai-based, state-owned developer, this month agreed
            to buy a 70
            percent stake in a residential and commercial real estate
            project in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a lot of excess capital in China that needs a way
            out at the moment,' Simon Lo, Hong Kong-based executive
            director for Asia research and advisory at property broker
            Colliers International, said in a phone interview today. 'Also,
            by investing in markets like New York, they believe they can
            gain from the recovery of the U.S. economy and real estate
            market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fosun (656), owned by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, fell
            0.3 percent to HK$6.79 at the midday trading break in Hong Kong.
            Shares in the Shanghai-based company have gained 37 percent this
            year, compared with the 2.6 percent increase in the benchmark
            Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Previ to Invest With BlackRock, JPMorgan Funds in Overseas Bet</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banco do Brasil SA's pension fund,
            Latin America's largest, will invest in U.S. and European stocks
            through funds of money managers including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) as it seeks to diversify holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Previ, as the Rio de Janeiro-based pension fund is known,
            is setting up its first vehicle to invest in large foreign
            firms, Chief Investment Officer Rene Sanda said today, adding
            that it will also invest through funds run by Schroders Plc and
            Franklin Templeton Investments. The fund, in which Previ will
            have a 25 percent stake will be managed by BB Gestao de Recursos
            DTVM SA, the asset manager that is also a Banco do Brasil unit,
            he said. Other Brazilian pension funds will participate in the
            fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BB DTVM will invest in funds already constituted by these
            four managers, it's a feeder,' Sanda told reporters today in
            Rio. The objective is 'portfolio diversification, not
            returns.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Previ, which manages 164 billion reais ($75.4 billion) for
            Banco do Brasil employees, has approved global investments of as
            much as 340 million reais this year in foreign stocks that may
            include Google Inc. (GOOG), said Antonio Luiz Benevides, executive
            manager of the fund. The pension fund may also invest in fixed-income and private equity abroad in the
            future as it accelerates
            real-estate investments in Brazil, he said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund for international stocks is expected to be set up
            by mid-November, Sanda said today, declining to give an estimate
            of its size until completion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's pension funds reported an average loss of 0.7
            percent in the first half, according to to the Brazilian pension
            fund association, known as Abrapp. Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa
            index fell 22 percent during that period while Google, based in
            Mountain View, California, rallied 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Madoff Workers, U.K. Branches, JPMorgan: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former employees of Bernard L.
            Madoff who are on trial on charges they aided the convicted con
            man's $17 billion Ponzi scheme were unaware of the fraud and
            were duped into helping him keep it going, lawyers told a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Bonventre, 66, the operations chief who signed
            checks for Madoff's securities firm and worked with its general
            ledger, was fooled by Madoff's 'depraved and pathological
            lies,' and never knew about the fraud, Andrew Frisch, his
            lawyer, said yesterday in his opening statement in federal court
            in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his guilty plea in 2009, Madoff said the market-making
            and proprietary trading side of his firm was 'legitimate'
            while admitting he ran the scheme from the advisory business,
            Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Annette Bongiorno, a 40-year Madoff employee who helped run
            the investment advisory business, 'never understood that she
            was involved in a fraud,' her lawyer Roland Riopelle told the
            jury yesterday in his opening statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawyers were the first among the defense to present
            opening statements in the trial of the five ex-employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Schwartz Oct. 16 told
            jurors that the defendants created millions of false, misleading
            records, and became rich in the process. The three men and two
            women on trial knew Madoff's securities firm didn't conduct real
            trades and used money from earlier investors to pay off new
            ones, the U.S. alleges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain has said the trial
            she's overseeing may last five months. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Bailey Says U.K. Regulator Wants Limits on Foreign Bank Branches &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Branches of foreign banks opening in the U.K. won't be able
            to take retail deposits unless they convince the regulator they
            can be easily wound down in a crisis, said Andrew Bailey, the
            U.K.'s top banking supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Branches from banks based outside the European Union
            'should stick to straightforward wholesale banking, of the type
            that supports world trade and capital flows,' Bailey, the chief
            executive officer of the Prudential Regulation Authority, told
            an audience of banking executives in London yesterday.
            'Resolution will be a key deciding factor in the PRA's
            judgments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government said this week that branches of Chinese
            banks would be approved for business in London. Chancellor of
            the Exchequer George Osborne said the PRA will start talks with
            Chinese banks later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bailey, deputy governor for prudential regulation at the
            Bank of England, said it is a 'general policy, not a China
            policy, and it is consistent with promoting the benefits of an
            open world economy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have encouraged banks to open
            subsidiaries rather than branches since the financial crisis
            because they have to comply with tougher capital and liquidity
            rules. Branches are supervised by the regulator of the home
            country of their parent bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Large U.K. Companies Get Up to 10 Years to Switch Auditor &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. antitrust regulators gave companies more time to seek
            new bids for accounting work, saying that large corporations
            must retender audits every 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The requirement will apply to companies in the FTSE 350
            Index starting in the last quarter of 2014, the U.K. Competition
            Commission said in a statement. The regulator also plans to
            forbid clauses limiting a company's choice of auditor to the top
            four accounting firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Competition Commission repeatedly backed away from
            stricter measures during a two-year inquiry focused on KPMG LLP,
            Deloitte LLP, Ernst Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
            In February, the U.K. regulator said it was considering forcing
            companies to change auditors, before proposing guidelines to
            rebid work every five years in July. The European Union is also
            working on new audit rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the Competition Commission's new rules, companies
            would be required to spell out when they next intend to hold a
            tender process if five or more years have elapsed since the last
            one. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European lawmakers voted in April on measures that would
            have banks, insurers and listed companies change accountants
            every 14 years, with an option for national authorities to
            extend this to 25 years. Michel Barnier, the EU's financial
            services chief, had proposed legislation that would have
            mandated audit rotation every six years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The legislation must be adopted by the full parliament, and
            approved by governments, before it can take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.K. Banks May Face 100 Billion-Pound Capital Gap, Exane Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. lenders may face a 100 billion-pound ($161 billion)
            capital shortage under a proposal by the country's Prudential
            Regulation Authority, which could force banks to postpone
            dividends and depress their returns, according to Exane BNP
            Paribas analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders would need to hold a fully loaded equity Tier 1
            ratio of 13 percent over time should the regulator adopt its
            proposal in full, the analysts, led by Jonathan Pierce, wrote in
            a note to clients yesterday. Banks will probably be given time
            to build up the buffer, prompting a review of their liabilities,
            the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), Britain's biggest mortgage
            lender, is the only U.K. bank likely to reach the target by
            2015, Exane said. While the PRA is unlikely to force other banks
            to scale back their assets quickly or sell more stock to
            investors, dividend payments are at risk, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CRU Steel Price Audit Finds 'No Major Gaps' Amid Global Scrutiny &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CRU, the publisher of business information on the metals,
            mining and fertilizer industries, completed a third-party audit
            of its U.S. Midwest steel prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The indexes, which include hot- and cold-rolled coil, hot-dipped galvanized coil and plate price
            are the most widely used
            in the world, London-based CRU said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The audit, by a 'Big Four' firm, included an electronic
            survey and site visits and found 'no major gaps,' according to
            CRU's statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At a time when some price reporting agencies have been
            under attack and some are still under investigation, it is
            crucial that companies like CRU continue to invest in both
            excellent processes and third-party assessments of our work,'
            Chief Operating Officer Fraser Murdoch said, according to
            closely held CRU. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banker Bonus Link With Sales Disappearing, FCA's Wheatley Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest banks in the U.K. are moving away from a
            culture of linking sales to bonuses after a series of scandals
            where products were improperly sold to consumers, the head of
            the markets regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin Wheatley, chief executive officer of the Financial
            Conduct Authority, made the remarks yesterday at a speech in
            London. He described the proposal as 'one of the most
            significant steps forward for the U.K. banking industry since
            2008.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA has been scrutinizing how bankers are rewarded
            after lenders were forced to pay billions of pounds to
            compensate customers who were sold payment-protection insurance
            they didn't need. U.K. banks have set aside about 15.5 billion
            pounds ($25 billion) for PPI claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Allianz CEO Says New Regulation to Create Room for Acquisitions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Diekmann, chief executive officer of Allianz SE (ALV)
            said tougher financial regulation will create takeover
            opportunities for Europe's biggest insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If Solvency II and Basel III mean more capital, then it's
            hard for mutuals to get that,' Diekmann, 58, said in an
            interview this week at Bloomberg headquarters in New York,
            referring to mutuals' customer-owned structure, which makes it
            more difficult for them to raise funds. That's why they may need
            to find a buyer should they require a larger capital buffer
            under Solvency II, the new risk-based rules for the industry
            scheduled to be implemented in 2016, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a situation in most countries where you have
            listed companies and mutual companies and there is a little bit
            of an unequal playing field,' Diekmann said. 'That gets
            resolved through regulation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allianz, based in Munich, acquired Turkish insurer Yapi
            Kredi Sigorta AS (YKSGR) in March for 684 million euros ($932 million),
            displacing France's Axa SA (CS) as Turkey's largest insurer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Solvency II, intended to harmonize the way insurers in
            Europe allocate capital against the risks they take, was
            originally scheduled to come into force in 2012. It has been
            delayed several times over and may now be implemented on Jan. 1,
            2016 with a transitional period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dimon Said to Have Given Up Role at Bank Unit on OCC Request &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            stepped down as chairman of the bank's main operating subsidiary
            in July because of a recommendation by the Office of the
            Comptroller of the Currency, according to two people with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency asked for the change as part of an effort to
            improve corporate governance at the company, said one of the
            people, who asked not to be identified because discussions were
            confidential. The move wasn't punitive, that person said. Robert
            Garsson, an OCC spokesman, declined to comment on the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dimon stepped down as chairman of the subsidiary July 1, a
            person with direct knowledge of the move said on Oct. 3. When
            asked about the situation during a conference call with
            reporters last week, the CEO referred to talks with government
            supervisors without specifying whether any request was made. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are in constant dialogue with our regulators regarding
            how to strengthen our governance and controls,' he said on the
            Oct. 11 call to discuss the bank's earnings. 'We thought this
            board change we made was consistent with our regulators' views
            and governance for a banking subsidiary.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move didn't affect Dimon's titles as chairman and CEO
            of the parent company. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan $13 Billion Accord Would Join Largest U.S. Pacts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is preparing to
            pay $13 billion to end U.S. civil probes of its mortgage-bond
            sales, an amount that ranks among the largest settlements by a
            single company and dwarfs fines previously imposed by the
            Justice Department. Past accords include: &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- The $246 billion settlement by the biggest U.S. tobacco
            companies in 1998 to resolve state government claims for the
            costs of treating sick smokers. Philip Morris Cos. and R.J.
            Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. were among firms that reached
            agreement with 50 state attorneys general to pay out the money
            over 25 years, scale back marketing and take steps to reduce
            youth smoking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- Pledges by Wall Street firms including UBS AG and Citigroup
            Inc. to repurchase more than $50 billion of auction-rate
            securities to settle state and federal complaints. Firms
            allegedly touted the instruments as safe, cash-like investments
            before the $330 billion market froze in February 2008, stranding
            investors who could no longer sell their holdings. The accords
            returned more than $67 billion to investors, the Securities and
            Exchange Commission has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- The $25 billion in payments and relief for troubled borrowers
            that five U.S. lenders -- JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp.,
            Citigroup, Wells Fargo Co. and Ally Financial Inc. -- pledged
            to resolve probes into mishandled foreclosures as part of a
            February 2012 deal with federal regulators and state attorneys
            general. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- BP Plc's $4.53 billion in settlements last year with the
            Justice Department and SEC, including a $1.26 billion criminal
            fine, relating to the April 2010 Macondo well blowout and
            explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 workers and set
            off the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, BP promised President Barack Obama it would set up
            a $20 billion trust fund for claims and costs. The company has
            so far spent at least $26 billion on the cleanup, reimbursements
            and other payments, and booked more than $42 billion in pretax
            charges related to the spill, according to statements on its
            website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- GlaxoSmithKline Plc's $3 billion to resolve criminal and
            civil allegations that it illegally promoted prescription drugs
            and failed to report safety data. The July 2012 settlement, the
            largest ever in a health-care fraud case in the U.S., included a
            $956.8 million criminal fine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- Pfizer Inc.'s $2.3 billion settlement in 2009, which included
            a $1.2 billion criminal fine, for illegally marketing the anti-inflammatory drug Bextra for uses that the
            Food and Drug
            Administration specifically had declined to approve because of
            safety concerns. The criminal fine was the largest ever imposed
            in the U.S. for any matter, then-Associate Attorney General Tom
            Perrelli said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- HSBC Holdings Plc's $1.9 billion deal to resolve charges it
            enabled Latin American drug cartels to launder billions of
            dollars. The bank, Europe's largest by market value, agreed to
            pay a $1.25 billion forfeiture and $665 million in civil
            penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;-- UBS $1.2 billion in fines from the Justice Department and
            Commodity Futures Trading Commission for trying to rig the
            London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more
            than $300 trillion of financial products worldwide. The bank
            also agreed to pay 160 million pounds ($259 million) to the U.K.
            Financial Services Authority, the largest fine imposed by the
            regulator, and disgorge 59 million francs ($65.3 million) in
            estimated profits to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory
            Authority. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Executive Macris Challenges London Whale Report</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Achilles Macris, a former JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) executive in Europe, will appeal findings by the
            U.K. markets watchdog that criticizes his actions after losses
            caused by Bruno Iksil, the trader known as the London Whale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Macris was 'deprived of the opportunity of responding' to
            the Financial Conduct Authority, a spokesman for his lawyers at
            Clifford Chance LLP said in an e-mailed statement today. Macris,
            who led the international Chief Investment Office, said the
            findings from September were 'made in error' and he will
            challenge them in a U.K. tribunal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA's 'assertions fail to take proper account of the
            actions he took and mischaracterize his dealings with the
            Authority at the relevant time,' the spokesman, Michael
            Osborne, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of the New York-based bank, characterized the $6.2 billion
            loss last year as
            'the stupidest and most embarrassing situation I have ever been
            a part of.' The bad bets led to an earnings restatement, a U.S.
            Senate subcommittee hearing and $920 million in penalties from
            regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission and
            the FCA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July 2012, JPMorgan said it would restate its first-quarter net revenue by $660 million because
            it wasn't confident
            that the valuations of the bank's derivatives trades were
            accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Deliberately Misled' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'conduct of CIO London management deliberately misled
            the authority about the situation' according to the FCA's
            notice on the fine, which is published on the agency's website.
            Macris wasn't mentioned by name in the FCA's findings following
            its investigation into Iksil, who was known as the London Whale
            because the size of his bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA, declined to
            immediately comment. Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on Macris. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iksil's former boss, Javier Martin-Artajo, and junior
            trader Julien Grout were indicted in the U.S. in September on
            five charges each, including securities fraud and conspiracy,
            for allegedly seeking to hide losses as they began to mount.
            Prosecutors have said Iksil, who wasn't charged, is cooperating
            with them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo and Grout are not in the U.S. and haven't
            returned to face the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Record JPMorgan Settlement Wouldn't Deter Some Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) tentative agreement to pay a record $13 billion to end civil claims over
            its sales of mortgage bonds, a deal that won't absolve the bank of potential criminal liability, hasn't
            shaken some investors' faith in Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Billionaire
            Home Depot Inc. founder Ken Langone said he sees the accord as a buying opportunity. The pact with the U.S.
            Justice Department would resolve claims that the bank, Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc.
            misleadingly packaged and sold mortgage-backed securities. JPMorgan, which acquired both lenders at the
            government's urging in 2008, fell 10 cents to $54.20 at 12:28 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            brunt of this misbehavior occurred before Jamie or JPMorgan had anything to do with these two companies,'
            Langone, 78, said yesterday in a telephone interview. 'I'm very, very comfortable as an investor in
            JPMorgan.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dimon, 57, personally negotiated the terms in a call with U.S. Attorney
            General Eric Holder after markets closed Oct. 18. The government's mounting demand for payments tied to Bear
            Stearns and WaMu had frustrated the CEO's push to end probes this year, driving legal reserves to $23
            billion and causing the New York-based bank's first quarterly loss under his watch. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) hired Liam Pepper from JPMorgan Chase Co. to lead the agriculture
            sales
            team as the bank is expanding its commodity business. &lt;/p&gt;

            he marketed agricultural derivatives and commodity-related
            financing in the Asia-Pacific region, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered also hired Wilson from JPMorgan last
            year. Pepper worked at National Australia Bank Ltd. before

        <headline>JPMorgan Settlement Said to Include Money for Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s tentative $13
            billion settlement will include about $3 billion for states and
            federal regulators, much of which may be passed on to investors
            who bought faulty mortgage-backed securities, according to two
            people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement will also cover a $2 billion penalty against
            the bank, $4 billion for the Federal Housing Finance Agency,
            which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and about $4 billion
            to help homeowners in hard-hit metropolitan areas, according to
            the people, who asked not to be identified because the accord
            hasn't been finalized and negotiations aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, is seeking to
            settle multiple civil claims that the company misrepresented the
            quality of mortgage-bonds that were packaged and sold at the
            height of the U.S. housing boom by JPMorgan as well as by Bear
            Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual Inc., both of which were
            acquired by the New York-based bank in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the settlement will help compensate investors who
            bought securities from all three entities, the bank won't pay
            fines for misdeeds committed by Bear Stearns and Washington
            Mutual, the people said. The accord wouldn't release JPMorgan or
            its executives from possible criminal liability, a person
            familiar with the settlement's terms said on Oct. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is still working
            out final details of the record settlement with the U.S.
            Department of Justice, including a statement of facts, the
            people said. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New
            York, didn't reply to calls and e-mails seeking comment. Adora
            Andy Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New York &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some pieces might not be concluded by the time a deal is
            announced, they said. Both sides are still working out the
            details of how to disburse the relief to homeowners and
            investors, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $3 billion portion will be split between California
            Attorney General Kamala Harris, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, the Federal Deposit Insurance
            Corp., National
            Credit Union Administration and possibly another state, the
            people said. New York state will receive about $500 million and
            will probably use it to reimburse investors, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal and New York Times reported the
            breakdown of the settlement earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Guilty Plea Sought by Holder Shows Harder Stance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon went to Washington almost a month ago
            to see if U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder would settle a criminal probe of mortgage fraud at the bank if
            it paid more money to resolve related civil investigations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holder's team, which
            included Deputy Attorney General James Cole and Associate Attorney General Tony West, said ending the
            investigation by the U.S. attorney in Sacramento would require the bank to plead guilty to something,
            according to a person familiar with the talks, which were held in a conference room that was Robert F.
            Kennedy's office when he had Holder's job. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later, the department proposed the bank plead
            guilty to making false statements related to sales of toxic mortgage bonds. The bank proposed a
            nonprosecution agreement, which Holder rejected, the person said. The bank agreed to assist the continuing
            criminal probe. The negotiation typifies the harder line the Obama administration is taking in its second
            term. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holder, 62, in an interview with Bloomberg News about the department's new
            aggressiveness on bank probes, said: 'It was clearly a priority for the president, it was a priority for me
            and for this Justice Department. One look at the magnitude of harm and the number of people suffering as a
            result of these acts that we're looking into made sense to me that my personal involvement was needed.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Eminence Seen Fading in Default Swaps: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s advantage
            over its Wall Street peers is fading in the eyes of credit-derivatives traders as fines and regulator probes
            hobble profits
            while firms from Citigroup Inc. to Morgan Stanley rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps traders are demanding 16 basis points
            less to protect against losses on JPMorgan bonds than the
            average cost to insure debt of the bank's five-biggest U.S.
            rivals, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The gap, a
            measure of the bank's credit strength relative to its
            competitors, has narrowed from an average 80 basis points since
            2008 and 152 in April 2012, the month before JPMorgan disclosed
            a trading loss that reached $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With regulatory fines and penalties that are poised to
            approach $15 billion, the playing field is leveling between the
            only Wall Street bank to stay profitable through the financial
            crisis and rivals that the credit seizure pushed to the edge of
            failure. Swaps tied to Citigroup, which last month removed the
            final vestiges of its government bailout, narrowed to within 6
            basis points of JPMorgan's for the first time since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'JPMorgan's Turn' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's JPMorgan's turn to have its own types of concerns,
            albeit ones that are much less severe from a credit perspective
            than the others' and in an improved economy, said Pri De Silva,
            a bank analyst at debt-research firm CreditSights Inc. in New
            York. For lenders such as Citigroup, Bank of America and Morgan
            Stanley, 'the balance sheets are in much better shape now
            compared with credit-crisis days,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tentative JPMorgan Pact Said to Hit Snag Over FDIC Funds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) tentative
            agreement to pay a record $13 billion to end civil claims over
            its sales of mortgage bonds has hit a snag because of the bank's
            bid to make the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. liable for part
            of the payment, a person familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department is opposing JPMorgan's request
            that the FDIC assume liability for investors' losses stemming
            from Washington Mutual Inc., the person, who sought anonymity to
            discuss the private negotiations, said today. JPMorgan acquired
            Washington Mutual's assets in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Resolving part of the $13 billion tentative agreement
            today, JPMorgan agreed to pay $5.1 billion to settle Federal
            Housing Finance Agency claims related to home loans and
            mortgage-backed securities the bank sold to Fannie Mae (FNMA) and
            Freddie Mac. (FMCC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement includes $4 billion to resolve claims over
            mortgage bonds and $1.1 billion to settle claims that JPMorgan
            sold faulty mortgages directly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
            that the companies packaged into their own securities, the FHFA
            said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the FHFA agreement, JPMorgan preserved its right to seek
            FDIC reimbursement for FHFA claims stemming from Washington
            Mutual's estate, which is managed by the FDIC. JPMorgan has been
            in a legal battle with the FDIC over who should pay certain
            liabilities from the failed thrift, which the agency placed into
            receivership in 2008, selling JPMorgan the remaining assets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan's Pinto Cut His Stake in Bank Months Ago</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Pinto, co-head of JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s corporate and investment bank, sold $7.6 million
            in company stock in a pair of previously undisclosed
            transactions months ago, according to a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A delay in reporting the sales, which occurred in April and
            July, 'was an error which we caught and corrected,' said Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the New York-based
            firm. The
            Securities and Exchange Commission requires transactions by
            corporate insiders to be disclosed within two business days,
            according to the agency's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pinto, 50, sold 73,000 shares valued at $3.56 million on
            April 29 and 73,247 shares valued at $4.06 million on July 15,
            according to yesterday's filing. The deals disposed of almost
            all of his direct holdings that would have been eligible for
            sale at the time, according to descriptions of his awards and
            their terms in January filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has risen 19 percent this year to $52.52 at 10:52
            a.m. in New York, trailing the 26 percent increase in the KBW
            Bank Index (BKX) of 24 U.S. lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pinto also exercised 400,000 stock options that gave him
            shares valued at about $22 million and sold 263,057 shares for
            $14.5 million to cover the cost of the transaction as well as
            his tax obligations on July 15, according to a July 17 filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Probe Prosecutor Put Away Tomato Racketeer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Benjamin Wagner, the top U.S.
            prosecutor for mostly rural eastern California, has busted the
            head of a tomato-packing company for racketeering and wrangled a
            settlement from a lumber company over a wildfire. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He's also prosecuted more than 250 people for mortgage
            fraud in a district that includes six of the 10 U.S. cities
            hardest hit by foreclosures since the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the typical bad guys Wagner targets are local
            mortgage brokers and foreclosure scam artists, he has one
            investigation that stands out. He's leading the criminal probe
            of JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
            refused to close down when the government and the bank reached a
            tentative $13 billion settlement over mortgage-related
            malfeasance, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since Wagner's appointment by President Barack Obama in
            2009 as the U.S. attorney in Sacramento, the state capital, he's
            taken on the role of sheriff of the region's housing market.
            He's prosecuted people such as Eric Hernandez, a Bakersfield,
            California, home loan broker sentenced last month to about 11
            years in prison for cheating lenders, including JPMorgan, out of
            $6 million by submitting fraudulent applications to obtain
            loans. &lt;/p&gt;

            Andrew Castaldo from Bank of America Corp. (BAC) to help advise on oil
            and gas deals, according to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Castaldo will be based in New York report to Hernan Cristerna and Christopher Ventresca, JPMorgan's
            global co-heads
            of mergers and acquisitions, the document shows. The contents of
            the memo were confirmed by the bank's New York-based spokeswoman
            Tasha Pelio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Castaldo, who worked at Citigroup Inc. before joining Bank
            of America in 2006, helped advise Apache Corp. on its $7 billion
            purchase of assets from BP Plc in 2010. He also worked on
            Regency Energy Partners LP's $5.6 billion acquisition of PVR
            Partners LP, a natural gas pipeline and processing company,
            which was announced this month. &lt;/p&gt;

            mergers and in May amid an overhaul of the top management of the
            team. Ventresca previously was JPMorgan's head of North
            American MA, while Cristerna oversaw MA for Europe,

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When Ken Duberstein's secretary told him Michael Dell was on the phone on the afternoon of July 31,
            there was little doubt about the topic. That morning, Dell Inc.'s special board committee had rejected the
            latest offer from Dell to take the personal-computer company private, a battle that was dragging into its
            11th month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'What do we need to do to get this deal over the goal line?' Dell's founder
            and chief executive officer recalled asking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raise the bid, responded Duberstein, a
            69-year-old tough-talking former chief of staff for Ronald Reagan who sat on the special committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Duberstein, now a Washington, D.C., lobbyist, laid out the stakes for the 48-year-old executive in
            another call later that evening. If the deal wasn't approved -- a shareholder vote was scheduled for two
            days later -- Dell might lose control of the company he founded in his University of Texas dorm room in
            1984. A no vote would indicate a lack of confidence in Dell, and some board members had already lost faith
            in his management, according to three people familiar with the directors' thinking. If activist shareholders
            began calling for Dell's ouster, the board might be inclined to honor the request, these people said. Dell
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) are putting their top London currency dealers on
            leave after regulators probing the manipulation of foreign-exchange rates started investigating the traders'
            use of an instant-message group, three people with knowledge of the moves said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rohan
            Ramchandani, Citigroup's head of European spot trading, was told yesterday he will be placed on leave, said
            one of the people who asked not to be identified because he wasn't authorized to talk publicly. Richard
            Usher, JPMorgan's chief dealer in London, went on leave two weeks ago, said another person. Both are taking
            leave by mutual agreement with their employers and neither has been suspended, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) has also placed Matt Gardiner, its assistant chief dealer in the U.K.

            knowledge of the probe said this month. The roster of banks in the group changed as the men moved firms and

            &lt;p&gt;Aug. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Former JPMorgan Chase Co. trader
            Javier Martin-Artajo was released from police custody after
            telling a Madrid court he opposed attempts by U.S. prosecutors
            to extradite him on charges he hid trading losses that cost the

            &lt;p&gt;Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slid the most since June and
            oil surged to an 18-month high amid concern the U.S. will take
            military action against Syria. Treasuries, the yen and gold rose
            while Turkey's lira and India's rupee reached record lows. &lt;/p&gt;

            Financial Officer Pierre Wauthier mentioned him in his suicide
            note, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

            most important economic-policy decision of his second term:
            picking a new chairman for the Federal Reserve. We shouldn't be
            optimistic, because nothing the president has said or done
            suggests that he is at all displeased with a Fed performance
            that has been just short of disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;

            just the favorite for Federal Reserve chairman. He's the
            overwhelming favorite. Unless something truly unexpected shows
            up in the vetting process (a paid toast at Bashar al-Assad's
            birthday party, for example) or the administration comes to
            believe Senate Democrats will revolt against a Summers

        <headline>JPMorgan Operating Risk Rises With Past Seen as Prologue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has pledged billions of dollars to
            improve compliance and cybersecurity. That's not stopping regulators from treating the bank as if it were
            riskier than ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm's operational risk-weighted assets, a measure devised by
            regulators that determines how much capital the bank needs to hold against potential losses from human
            error, external threats, fraud and litigation, rose 6.7 percent in the second quarter to $400 billion,
            according to an August filing. Regulators can point to $23 billion of legal settlements last year and a
            cyber-attack discovered last month as they push JPMorgan to boost its buffer against unforeseen losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) that together racked
            up more than $100 billion in post-financial crisis legal costs are facing similar pressures. At JPMorgan,
            the largest U.S. bank, that means more than $35 billion that can't be used for dividends or buybacks,
            prompting Dimon to call it 'stranded capital.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Banks are saying, 'We've made huge
            investments in technology and compliance personnel and we aren't getting credit for it,'' said Justin
            Fuller, a senior director at Fitch Ratings in Chicago. 'At the same time, the only verifiable data points
            are these huge litigation costs they've just had, and it's hard to ignore those.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Societe
            Generale SA (GLE) are among lenders seen driving a 10 percent gain
            among European banks by year-end as investor concerns over their
            capital levels and legal bills ease, JPMorgan Chase Co.
            analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European bank shares, tracked by the benchmark Stoxx 600
            Banks Index, will reverse their underperformance relative to the
            broader market in recent months, the analysts including Kian Abouhossein wrote in an e-mailed report
            yesterday. The banks
            index, down 3.2 percent in the six months through Sept. 1, today
            rose 0.7 percent to 198.06 as of 11:15 a.m. in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank is leading an unprecedented
            regulatory scrutiny of the financial health of the region's
            biggest lenders as it prepares to assume their supervision, an
            effort to restore confidence in the industry. European banks
            have also faced investor concerns that fines and settlements
            would erode capital after France's BNP Paribas SA (BNP) paid a record
            $8.97 billion penalty for breaking U.S. sanctions in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'ECB stress test should be a positive event,' the
            analysts wrote in the report. All 34 European banks JPMorgan
            tested passed its own assessment, which used the same 5.5
            percent minimum capital ratio the ECB will employ in the more
            adverse of two stress test scenarios, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ECB is scheduled to release the results of its tests
            and examination of the balance sheets of 128 euro area lenders
            next month. Firms will have six months to raise equity to cover
            any shortfalls identified in its balance sheet review or the
            milder stress-test scenarios, and nine months to address
            deficiencies resulting from the more-adverse scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan added Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank,
            Societe Generale of France and Amsterdam-based ING Groep NV (INGA) to
            its list of 'top picks,' according to the report. The analysts
            removed Caixabank SA (CABK) after the Barcelona-based lender rallied 21
            percent this year, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) said it hired
            Naohisa Ando, a former managing director at Nomura Holdings
            Inc. (8604), as head of its new Japan capital market advisory
            department to boost its fundraising business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ando, 49, who helped lead equity capital markets operations
            at Nomura Securities Co., joined JPMorgan Securities Japan Co.
            last week, Yukako Yoshino, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for the
            U.S. firm, said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's stock rally and economic recovery helped companies
            raise 3.4 trillion yen ($34 billion) selling shares this year,
            more than triple the 901 billion yen issued a year earlier, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan is the No. 7 equity
            underwriter in the country, arranging offerings for firms
            including Suntory Beverage Food Ltd. (2587) and Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ando began his career in 1987 as an analyst at Nomura
            Research Institute Ltd. after graduating from Hitotsubashi
            University in Tokyo, JPMorgan said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees ECB Buying $53 Billion of Asset-Backed Bonds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will buy
            as much as 40 billion euros ($53 billion) of asset-backed
            securities as part of a program to stimulate the region's
            economy, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank will limit purchases to the new-issue
            market over a three-year period and focus on securities with the
            highest credit ratings, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
            wrote in a note. About 47 billion euros of asset-backed debt has
            been sold in the region this year, according to data from the
            New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ECB is preparing to buy ABS as it strives to revive
            lending to small-and medium-sized businesses that employ about
            70 percent of the European Union's private-sector workers. While
            the region's outstanding ABS market is as large as 1.2 trillion
            euros, a purchase program of this magnitude would necessitate it
            being expanded beyond SME-backed loans, the analysts said in the
            note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The purchase plan is important for a number of reasons,
            but broadly because it puts downward pressure on the cost of
            issuing ABS, and ultimately feeds into lower product margins on
            real economy lending,' Davies said by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt-based ECB has hired BlackRock Inc. (BLK) to provide
            advice as it thrashes out the final design of its plan,
            including how much, which assets, and what ranking of bonds it
            will buy. &lt;/p&gt;

            that U.S. financial institutions can be disrupted, the former director of the National Security Agency said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FBI is investigating the cyberattack on JPMorgan and whether other banks were
            penetrated in retaliation for U.S.- backed sanctions on Russia, according to people familiar with the

            chief and head of the U.S. Cyber Command, Alexander tracked and tried to thwart international hackers,
            giving him knowledge of their tactics. He was head of the NSA in 2008 when the country of Georgia was
            invaded by Russia and experienced a series of disruptive cyberattacks believed to be the work of Russian
            hackers. &lt;/p&gt;

            used in previous hacking attacks and is now being tapped by professional cybercriminals operating out of
            Eastern Europe to target banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Securing the Net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's
            investigators are only part of a larger group in the U.S. that includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation
            and the National Security Agency trying to trace the origin of the computer assault. The success of the
            attack on JPMorgan and another this week on Home Depot Inc. and even the theft of nude photos from
            celebrities' online Apple Inc. accounts highlight how hard it is to defend against increasingly
            sophisticated criminals. &lt;/p&gt;

            The people familiar with JPMorgan's investigation said the cybercriminals operating the global network had
            also aimed at other banks' systems, though they may not have been hacked. Close

        <headline>BlackRock Hires JPMorgan's Wadhwa as Rates Strategy Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's largest
            asset manager, hired Pavan Wadhwa, former head of U.S. dollar
            interest rate strategy at JPMorgan Chase Co., to lead a team
            focused on global interest rate analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wadhwa will join BlackRock's Americas fixed-income group
            later this month in New York and report to Bob Miller, head of
            the multisector retail and rates team and a portfolio manager on
            BlackRock's Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BASIX), Jessica Greaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
            BlackRock, said today
            in an e-mail. Prior to joining BlackRock, Wadhwa worked at
            JPMorgan for 15 years, including five as head of European and
            global interest rate strategy in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock, which manages $3.86 trillion in assets, has
            worked to improve the performance of its actively managed bond
            funds as deposits trailed those of index-based investments last
            year. The firm reorganized its bond division in 2012, giving
            unit heads such as Rick Rieder and Kevin Holt greater autonomy
            and accountability. Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink has
            said BlackRock is seeing a rotation in fixed income to more
            flexible, non-traditional bond products with shorter durations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wadhwa, who will be a managing director and the unit's head
            of rates strategy, started his career at BlackRock in 1995,
            where he was an associate in the financial modeling group. He
            has an MBA and a Ph.D. in finance from the University of Texas
            at Austin. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Alsacia Bonds Gain as JPMorgan Raises to Marketweight</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Inversiones Alsacia SA's dollar
            bonds gained the most in two months as JPMorgan Chase Co.
            raised its recommendation on the debt to the equivalent of hold,
            citing the bus company's new contract terms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on the bonds due in 2018 fell 1.46 percentage
            point to 21.54 percent at 1:44 p.m. in Santiago, the biggest
            decline on a closing basis since June 17, according to Trace,
            the bond pricing system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
            Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alsacia, which has asked bondholders for waivers of
            violations of its debt agreements, said on Aug. 29 that the
            government approved a 4 percent increase per passenger on its
            bus routes in Santiago. The company controls two of seven
            operators in the capital city's Transantiago public transport
            system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the increased passenger payments will not have a
            significant impact on the company's liquidity, they are
            'positive for the story,' JPMorgan analyst Daniel Sensel wrote
            in a research note. A meeting scheduled this week with debt
            holders also 'could be a reflection of the company's
            willingness to negotiate better terms with bondholders including
            a shorter term for the waivers and more transparency in terms of
            the outlook for the company,' Sensel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alsacia said Aug. 5 that its ratio of cash flow to total
            debt including interest fell below a level that would obligate
            it to prepay the 2018 bonds. The yield on the debt surged to a
            record high on Aug. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower demand for bus transportation and persistent fare
            cheating led to the violation of the debt agreements, the
            company said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rostelecom Said to Hire JPMorgan, Credit Suisse for Tele2 Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Rostelecom, Russia's state-run
            phone company, hired advisers to help it combine with wireless
            carrier Tele2 Russia to form a fourth mobile operator, a person
            briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The phone company hired JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Credit
            Suisse Group AG (CSGN) as advisers, said the person, who asked not to
            be identified as the discussions are private. State-controlled
            VTB Group (VTBR) acquired Swedish Tele2 AB's (TEL2B) Russian unit in a $3.55
            billion deal in April. While Rostelecom is majority owned by the
            state, it also has private shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A combination would help the two companies challenge market
            leaders OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT), OAO MegaFon (MFON) and VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)
            as the mobile-phone market in Russia expands with increased use
            of smartphones to browse the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rostelecom has almost 14 million mobile users, while Tele2
            Russia has 23 million. Working in different regions, the
            companies fit well together and would form a fourth countrywide
            wireless operator if combined, according to Konstantin Malofeev,
            a private shareholder in Rostelecom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks are proposing to combine the Moscow-based
            companies' wireless assets into a joint venture where Rostelecom
            would have control, Vedomosti reported today, citing
            unidentified sources. Rostelecom said last month it plans to
            finalize its strategy including wireless expansion in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrey Polyakov, a Moscow-based spokesman for Rostelecom,
            declined by phone to comment, as did Irina Rybakova, a
            spokeswoman for Tele2 Russia, and VTB's press office. JPMorgan
            and Credit Suisse press officials didn't immediately return
            calls requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Seeking Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rostelecom shares rose as much as 1.2 percent and traded up
            0.6 percent by 6:01 p.m. in Moscow, giving it a market value of
            $9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mobile TeleSystems and VimpelCom have said they've been
            seeking to acquire Tele2 Russia. Within Russia, MTS had almost
            72 million users at the end of the second quarter, while MegaFon
            had 64 million and VimpelCom had 57 million, according to
            researcher ACM Consulting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The potential integration of its mobile assets with Tele2
            will be a strategically logical development for Rostelecom,'
            Konstantin Chernyshev, a telecommunications analyst at VTB
            Capital, said in a note today. 'Any financial implications are
            hard to estimate at this point when the terms remain unclear.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Had Exodus of Tech Talent Before Hacker Breach</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;As hackers pierced JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) defenses in June, the bank's cybersecurity chief was
            just getting acquainted with his employer and its sprawling technology infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greg
            Rattray, a former U.S. Air Force commander for information warfare, became JPMorgan's head of information
            security that month after upheaval at the highest levels of the bank's tech division. His predecessor,
            Anthony Belfiore, had resigned early this year to join at least five JPMorgan leaders at First Data Corp. In
            between, Anish Bhimani was acting security officer while holding at least one other tech role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It sucks that this happened at the beginning of Greg's watch, but this is a legacy issue,' said
            Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer at anti-virus software firm Trend Micro Inc. 'They had an acting
            person who was juggling way too much, with no one fully dedicated to the role for a bit of time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Related: Computers for Hire Send JPMorgan Data to Russia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, has rushed to determine the scope of the assault and restore confidence
            in security at the biggest U.S. lender. While hackers targeted other banks' systems, JPMorgan is the only
            bank said to have had gigabytes of data stolen, including information on customer accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mexico Tax Plan Signals Belt-Tightening, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto
            may propose applying new food and soft-drink levies, boosting
            income tax rates, tightening corporate tax rules and scrapping
            gasoline subsidies, JPMorgan Chase Co. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2014 budget and tax proposal will attempt to increase
            the government's non-oil revenue while lightening the fiscal
            burden on state-owned oil monopoly Petroleos Mexicanos,
            JPMorgan's Nur Cristiani, Gabriel Lozano and Steven Palacio said
            in a report today. The plan is set to be unveiled Sept. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto's plan 'will likely involve a heated discussion
            as many of the matters under review are highly unpopular,' the
            JPMorgan analysts said. 'The government will need to carefully
            balance tax collection with lower dependency on oil revenues and
            current economic and consumption deceleration.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mexico's central bank changed the backdrop for Pena Nieto's
            announcement with the second cut this year in its benchmark
            interest rate after inflation decelerated to within its target
            range and the economy expanded at the slowest pace since the
            2009 recession. Lower rates may stimulate growth, easing the
            sting of possible tax increases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stocks reversed an earlier decline on the surprise rate
            cut, sending the IPC index up 0.6 percent at the close in Mexico
            City. The gauge slid 5.3 percent in the month that ended
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inflation Effect &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pemex, which provides about a third of government revenue,
            will be one focus of Pena Nieto's plan, according to the
            JPMorgan report, 'Tighten Your Belts, Fiscal Reform Is
            Coming.' The company has said it needs lower taxes and more
            investment as it strives to reverse eight straight years of
            production declines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Changes in the tax mix may produce a 'long-term' increase
            in non-oil government revenue of as much as 2.8 percent of gross
            domestic product, the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plan may include an increase in the income tax rate for
            higher earners to as much as 38 percent from the current level
            of 30 percent, and changes to corporate tax law that raise the
            effective rate, according to the JPMorgan analysts. Also
            possible is the imposition of a tax on gasoline and an end to
            subsidies for the fuel, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Food Tax &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto may also propose applying a 4 percent value-added tax to food, which could gradually
            climb as high as 8
            percent in subsequent years, JPMorgan said. Medicine and basic
            foods would probably be exempt. A 20 percent excise tax on
            beverages, excluding bottled water and milk, is also possible. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the plan, Mexico's annual inflation rate may rise by
            about 1.8 percentage points next year, plus a cumulative 0.5
            percentage point over the following three years, according to
            JPMorgan. Annual inflation rose to 3.54 percent in the 12 months
            through mid-August, the government said on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The need to boost tax receipts goes hand in hand with Pena
            Nieto's August proposal to allow more private investment in the
            energy industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fiscal bill will be equally important, as changes
            aiming to liberalize the energy sector -- including a revision
            of Pemex's current fiscal regime -- would need to be accompanied
            by changes aimed at boosting non-oil public revenues,' the
            JPMorgan analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- A probe of JPMorgan Chase Co.'s
            hiring practices in China has uncovered red flags across Asia,
            including an internal spreadsheet that linked appointments to
            specific deals pursued by the bank, people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;

            considering when to reduce bond buying were 'broadly
            comfortable' with Chairman Ben S. Bernanke's plan to taper this
            year if the economy strengthens, with a few saying a reduction
            may be needed soon, minutes of their last meeting show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Brevan Howard Traders Said to Depart as Fund Posts Loss in
            June &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aug. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Two Brevan Howard Asset Management
            LLP credit traders left in recent weeks, as the firm scales back
            after its biggest hedge fund had the worst monthly loss since
            2008 in June, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;4. Repo Market Decline Raises Alarm as Regulation Strains Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aug. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Regulations aimed at reducing the
            risk of another financial crisis are starting to upend a key
            part of the bond market that expedites trading in everything
            from Treasuries to junk bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Ex-JPMorgan Trader Released, Saying He Opposes U.S.
            Extradition &lt;/p&gt;

            Javier Martin-Artajo was released from police custody after
            telling a Madrid court he opposed attempts by U.S. prosecutors
            to extradite him on charges he hid trading losses that cost the
            bank $6.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

            Rallies &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slid the most since June and
            oil surged to an 18-month high amid concern the U.S. will take
            military action against Syria. Treasuries, the yen and gold rose
            while Turkey's lira and India's rupee reached record lows. &lt;/p&gt;

            Sachs Group Inc. vice president found liable for his role in a

            economically 'advanced' countries do not differ significantly
            in how satisfied they are with their jobs. Because they are
            about equally productive, the reasoning is, they must produce
            things the same way, and so their work experience must be the
            same, too. &lt;/p&gt;

            Yosemite National Park. Muir was about to decline when a friend
            warned him that one must always accept the president's
            invitation. Muir was offended by this notion, because it seemed
            to treat the president like a king. In the end, Muir decided to
            make the journey after all: 'I suppose I shouldn't refuse just
            because he happens to be president,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and insurers
            reached a $300 million settlement with property owners who
            accused the companies of overcharging for hazard insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Assurant Inc. (AIZ) and other insurers will pay refunds
            valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium costs to homeowners who
            had the policies placed on their properties by the bank starting
            in January 2008, according to documents filed Sept. 6 in federal
            court in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Homeowners covered by the case stand 'to recover hundreds,
            if not thousands, of dollars as a result of the settlement,'
            lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a memorandum. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, was accused of placing
            mortgage borrowers' required hazard and wind coverage with
            Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates, covering costs of
            kickbacks to a JPMorgan unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The settlement will have no expected impact on our
            financials,' Amy Bonitatibus, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in
            an e-mailed statement. The insurance agreement at issue was
            discontinued this year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shawn Kahle, a spokeswoman for New York-based Assurant,
            didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
            settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Saccoccio v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 13-cv-21107, U.S. District Court, Southern

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the bank that
            incurred a $6.2 billion trading loss last year, will elect Linda B. Bammann and Michael A. Neal to its board

            items, and will guide the board in considering the succession of
            chief executive officers, New York-based JPMorgan said today in
            a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in May rejected a proposal to split the chairman
            and CEO roles, which advisory firms such as Institutional
            Shareholder Services said would improve oversight. The bank said
            today that the board will hold executive sessions without
            company management at every regular board meeting, make members
            available to meet with major shareholders and won't rotate the
            lead independent director position every year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bammann and Neal are 'proven leaders and will bring
            outstanding, risk, finance and management experience to our

            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last

        <headline>BlackRock to JPMorgan See Deeper Emerging-Market Losses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street's biggest firms are
            predicting intensifying bond losses in emerging markets, where
            borrowing costs have already soared to the highest in more than
            four years versus U.S. corporate debt, as the Federal Reserve
            considers curtailing record stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not yet convinced that we've seen the worst in
            terms of flows out of emerging markets,' Jeffrey Rosenberg, the
            chief investment strategist in fixed-income at New York-based
            BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, said in a
            telephone interview, expressing his own views. 'We see a lot of
            valuation change but we see the potential for even more
            valuation change.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have yanked $22.1 billion from emerging-market
            bond funds since the end of April, almost five times the amount
            pulled from U.S. corporate credit, according to EPFR Global.
            That's pushed the extra yield that buyers now demand to own
            dollar-denominated emerging-market debt instead of U.S. company
            notes to 1.4 percentage points, about the most since December
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs are soaring from record lows reached in
            January as speculation deepens that the Fed will curtail its so-called quantitative easing as soon as this
            month, signaling an
            end to the flood of cheap money that's propped up asset prices
            from India to China and Indonesia. The exodus from developing
            nations began after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress
            on May 22 that the central bank could scale back the pace of its
            $85 billion of purchases of mortgage bonds and Treasuries if the
            U.S. economy showed sustained improvement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan CEO Says 'Greener Pastures' in Trading Possible</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Record low volatility across equity
            and debt markets could ease next year, boosting Wall Street
            firms' trading operations, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Financial
            Officer Marianne Lake said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unusually calm markets and low client activity that
            caused the worst first half in trading since the financial
            crisis will probably continue through the middle of 2015, Lake
            said today at a conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It may be a tale of two cities where the first half looks
            a little bit more like a continuation of some the things we'd
            been seeing this year, but there may be greener pastures in the
            second half,' Lake said. 'When things change, they can change
            very, very quickly, so we want to be positioned for that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank, run by Daniel Pinto, posted a 12 percent revenue drop to
            $17.6 billion in the
            first six months of 2014. Firms may have to wait until 2016
            before markets significantly improve, Pinto said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will benefit from cost-cutting programs in retail
            and institutional units and 'more finality' on rules governing
            capital at the biggest banks, Lake said today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BofA Cuts Jobs as Mortgage Slump Traps JPMorgan, Wells Fargo</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage lenders including Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) that feasted on
            refinancings as interest rates reached all-time lows are now warning that the drop in demand may be steeper
            than expected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even Bank of America Corp., which fell to fourth in U.S. mortgages last
            year as it scaled back after buying Countrywide Financial Corp., is reducing capacity further as surging
            interest rates crimp demand. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm is eliminating 2,100 jobs and closing
            16 offices by Oct. 31, said two people with direct knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Home lenders
            are tempering forecasts after interest rates rose amid signs the Federal Reserve may scale back stimulus
            efforts. Wells Fargo, the top U.S. home lender, said yesterday that third-quarter originations may fall 29
            percent to $80 billion. JPMorgan, ranked No. 2, said it expects to lose money on home lending in the second
            half as volumes drop as much 40 percent from the year's first six months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There was
            speculation, I'm sure by Wells but a lot of other people, that there would be second-quarter momentum that
            would carry through to the third quarter,' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance in
            Bethesda, Maryland. Yesterday's comments and Bank of America's job cuts show 'that some of that stuff
            appeared very quickly in terms of people dropping out of the market. That clearly doesn't bode well.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Mexico's Pena Nieto Seeks Capital Gains, High Earners Taxes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto is proposing taxes on
            capital gains, sugary drinks and the nation's highest earners in
            a bid to wean Latin America's second-largest economy off its
            dependence on oil revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bill sent to congress Sept. 8 along with the
            president's 2014 budget proposal would place a 10 percent tax on
            individuals' profits from stock sales and dividends, raise the
            maximum personal income tax rate to 32 percent from 30 percent
            and avoid taxing food and medicine. The measures would help
            offset a proposed lower tax burden for state-owned oil producer
            Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, and help pay for universal social
            security and unemployment insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ratings companies will probably be disappointed by the
            decision not to tax food and medicine, while some government
            bond investors may be hurt as additional debt issuance boosts
            supply of the securities, said Alonso Cervera, the chief Mexico
            economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The tax bill would increase government revenue, according
            to the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pena Nieto has pledged to boost tax collection as part of a
            series of economic overhauls to speed up growth that's 40
            percent slower than the regional average over the past five

            &lt;p&gt;The reform would end a tax benefit, known as fiscal
            consolidation, which allows holding companies to postpone paying

            &lt;h2&gt;Tin Smelters in Indonesia Pushing for JFX Trade Permits &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smelters and Jakarta Futures Exchange are expected to meet
            with the Trade Ministry this week to push for permits to trade
            physical tin contracts, said M.B. Gunawan, director and general
            manager at PT Stanindo Inti Perkasa, a metals manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smelters stopped operations and won't resume until the
            Futures Exchange gets trading permits or the government delays
            the rule, Gunawan said by phone from Jakarta yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miners halted work because they can't sell ore, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smelters met last week. Most are not interested in joining
            the Indonesia Commodity and Derivatives Exchange, Gunawan said.
            They prefer the Futures Exchange because they can show their
            brand and interact directly with buyers, he said. The Futures
            Exchange will display smelters' brands on the trading system,
            according to Gunawan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FDIC to Sell $2.42 Billion of Citigroup Debt to End Rescue Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is selling $2.42
            billion of bonds issued by Citigroup Inc. (C) in a transaction that
            will eliminate U.S. government holdings in the bank linked to
            the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup exchanged the subordinated notes due 2025 and
            2043 to the FDIC for other securities used to pay the government
            for $301 billion of asset guarantees, the New York-based bank
            said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Citigroup won't receive
            any proceeds from the resale to the public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offering is the latest step to end taxpayer support for
            Citigroup, which took more bailout assistance than any other
            U.S. lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When the transaction concludes, no U.S. government entity
            will continue to hold any securities in Citi issued as a result
            of the financial crisis,' Mark Costiglio, a spokesman for the
            lender, said by e-mail. The government's investment realized a
            return of 'more than $13 billion,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup issued a combined $7.06 billion in preferred
            shares to the FDIC and the Treasury as consideration for the
            loss-sharing protection, provided to help shore up investor
            confidence in the bank during the worst financial crisis since
            the Great Depression. The Treasury said in February that it
            expected to receive $894 million in proceeds from a similar
            offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Barr, a spokesman at the FDIC, declined to comment on
            the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hewlett-Packard Says Polish Regulators Join Bribery Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) said the Polish Anti-Corruption Bureau
            joined an investigation by U.S. regulators into potential
            violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by the computer
            maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The probe, along with the U.S. Department of Justice and
            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, centers on an employee
            of Hewlett-Packard's Polska unit and 'public sector
            transactions in Poland,' according to a regulatory filing
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agencies are also investigating 'public-sector
            transactions' in Russia, Mexico and other countries that
            weren't named, according to the filing. The Foreign Corrupt
            Practices Act, or FCPA, makes it illegal for U.S. business
            people to bribe foreign officials. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Reserve Primary Fund Settles Shareholder Suit for $54.9 Million &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bruce R. Bent II, president of the $62.5 billion Reserve
            Primary money-market fund that failed during the financial
            crisis, agreed to settle a shareholder lawsuit in an accord
            worth about $54.9 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bent and his father, Bruce R. Bent, are among defendants
            that agreed to pay $10 million in cash, drop their claim for
            $42.4 million from a court-established expense fund, and to
            allow $2.5 million from the expense fund to go to shareholders.
            None of the defendants admitted wrongdoing as part of the
            proposed settlement to end a class-action lawsuit led by Third
            Avenue Institutional International Value Fund LP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in September 2008, two days after Lehman
            Brothers Holdings Inc. went bankrupt in the midst of the worst
            U.S. economic crisis since the Great Depression. The Reserve
            Primary money-market fund held $785 million in Lehman debt. A
            run on the fund triggered its failure when it 'broke the buck'
            by failing to maintain a $1-a-share net asset value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A federal jury found Bruce Bent II negligent on one claim
            of violating a securities law. His father was absolved of all
            claims in a suit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund's closing sparked an investor run on similar money
            funds, contributing to a freeze among global credit markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement is subject to court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Reserve Primary Fund Securities Derivative
            Class Action Litigation, 08-cv-08060. The SEC case is SEC v.
            Reserve Management Co., 09-cv-04346, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Secret Swiss Accounts No Longer Safe Tax Dodge, Prosecutor Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taxpayers who still believe they can hide secret Swiss bank
            accounts from the Internal Revenue Service are 'beyond
            foolish,' the top U.S. tax prosecutor said as a five-year
            crackdown expands to new offshore havens. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The enforcement drive has forced a 'remarkable' change in
            the ability of the U.S. to find secret accounts in Switzerland,
            the world's largest offshore financial center with about $2.2
            trillion of assets, said Kathryn Keneally, assistant attorney
            general in the Justice Department's tax division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If someone had an account in Switzerland, it is beyond
            foolish to think that that account is going to remain secret,'
            said Keneally, 55. 'In the last five years, we've seen a
            remarkable change in our ability to get information concerning
            Swiss bank accounts. It's extraordinary. Switzerland is no
            longer a good place to hide assets for tax reasons.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Keneally, in her first interview since taking the job in
            April 2012, said a new U.S. amnesty program for Swiss banks to
            disclose how they aided tax evasion puts taxpayers and offshore
            enablers at risk of prosecution. Since 2009, the U.S. has
            prosecuted 68 U.S. taxpayers, three Swiss banks, and 30 bankers,
            lawyers, and advisers. Another 38,000 Americans moved $5.5
            billion to the U.S. and avoided prosecution by saying who helped
            them offshore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fourteen firms are under criminal investigation. On Aug.
            29, the U.S. announced a program for other Swiss banks to avoid
            charges. They must pay penalties and disclose their cross-border
            activities, among other measures. Banks that don't come forward
            by the Dec. 31 deadline could face criminal charges, Keneally
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have investigations and activities that will be coming
            in other parts of the world that I can't comment on right now,'
            she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Removes Lending Barriers in Booming U.S. Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the nation's largest bank by assets, is easing mortgage lending standards
            in housing markets hard hit by the crash where prices are surging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank lowered some
            down payment requirements in Florida, Nevada, Arizona and Michigan because they will 'no longer be
            considered distressed states,' it informed smaller lenders it buys loans from in July. The second-largest
            U.S. mortgage lender also loosened underwriting requirements for a refinancing program for Federal Housing
            Administration borrowers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the economy rebounds and home values climb at about the
            fastest pace since 2006, lenders including the largest, Wells Fargo (WFC) Co., JPMorgan, Bank of America
            Corp. (BAC), and mortgage insurers are easing the tightest credit conditions in two decades, lifting
            restrictions put in place after the worst real estate bust since the Great Depression. Banks are being
            forced to compete harder for customers after a spike in borrowing costs from near-record lows slowed
            refinancing by more than 70 percent and curbed what had been record profits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Historically,
            you make underwriting as tough as possible when people are lined up at the door and when the lines go away,
            you start loosening underwriting to get people back,' said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fed Survey &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 10 percent of banks reported they loosened
            standards on 'prime' or low-risk residential loans in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve's July
            survey of senior loan officers. The average FICO score for closed loans fell to 737 in July, the lowest
            level since at least August 2011, according to data compiled by Pleasanton, California-based Ellie Mae.
            Borrowers loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios also increased from May, signaling lenders are willing to
            accept more risk to maintain volume. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, which originated about 1 in 4 U.S.
            home loans in the first half of the year, has relaxed certain credit standards and is requiring borrowers to
            put up less equity to buy high-priced homes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based bank began, on July
            13, to offer nonconforming loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 85 percent, up from 80 percent, according to
            Tom Goyda, a bank spokesman. That means borrowers have to come up with less equity to get financing. The
            terms on the loans, which are too large for purchase by Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac, apply for new
            home purchases and refinancing, and don't require mortgage insurance, Goyda said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Total Picture' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Getting approved for a home loan hinges on a borrower's
            total financial picture,' Goyda said in an e-mailed statement. 'We are always evaluating our credit
            standards in light of market conditions and trends.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goyda declined to provide further
            details on where Wells Fargo has eased underwriting restrictions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan removed a
            minimum 640 credit score requirement for the FHA's streamlined refinancing program in May, enabling more
            borrowers to get new home loans at lower interest rates, according to spokeswoman Amy Bonitatibus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are trying to lure more borrowers as mortgage applications plunged last week to a five-year
            low. Refinancing dropped more than 20 percent, the lowest since June 2009. The industry benefitted from
            record profit margins last year, when refinancing accounted for 76 percent of last year's $1.75 trillion in
            loan originations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told investors in July
            that rising interest rates could trigger a 'dramatic reduction' in the bank's mortgage profits after
            mortgage fees and related revenue at the bank dropped 20 percent to $1.82 billion in the second quarter,
            compared with $2.27 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Eliminating Jobs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;An
            increase in lending for home purchases won't be enough to replace a drop in refinancings, JPMorgan Chief
            Financial Officer Marianne Lake said in a presentation at an investor conference this week. The bank's
            pretax-profit margins and income on mortgage lending will be 'slightly negative' in the third and fourth
            quarters as the firm takes time to adjust its fixed costs. The firm is eliminating as many as 19,000 jobs in
            its mortgage and community-banking divisions through 2014 as Dimon trims expenses, JPMorgan said in
            February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We continuously review our lending standards to help families buy homes they
            can afford over the long term,' Bonitatibus said. 'We have responded to improvements in the housing market
            by removing some additional requirements we put in place in hard-hit markets during the crisis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America has been easing underwriting standards in markets it designated as 'soft' in
            certain parts of the country as the housing market improves, said Kris Yamamoto, a company spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Loosened Credit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated the
            central bank may slow its purchases of government and mortgage bonds, the average rate on 30-year home loans
            has risen more than 1.2 percentage points after hitting a low of 3.35 percent in May, according to Freddie
            Mac data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Loosened mortgage credit would offset some of the impact of rising rates,
            which make homeownership more expensive,' said Jed Kolko, chief economist at San Francisco-based
            property-listings service Trulia Inc. 'Because rates are rising, demand for refinancing has plummeted and
            some banks have suggested that would open up capacity for home-purchase lending.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            U.S. homeownership rate fell to 65 percent this year, its lowest level since 1995, according to Census
            Bureau data, as fewer people were able to qualify for a mortgage. Banks are starting to ease credit with
            home prices across the country rising 12.1 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the
            SP/Case-Shiller index of 20 cities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cash Buyers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prices in some of
            the hardest-hit markets have rebounded faster. Las Vegas gained 24.9 percent, Phoenix showed a 19.8 percent
            increase, Detroit rose 16.4 percent Miami-area values were up 14.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private-equity
            firms such as Blackstone Group LP building rental businesses and other cash buyers have helped lift house
            prices in cities showing some of the biggest gains. Their mass purchases have made it more difficult for
            borrowers seeking mortgage financing, as they compete for a shrinking supply of properties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            Florida, lenders including JPMorgan and mortgage insurers this year removed many of the additional
            requirements that had helped to push the share of cash buyers above 45 percent in the second quarter, said
            Rob Nunziata, co-Chief Executive Officer of FBC Mortgage LLC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Florida Downpayments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan decreased the minimum downpayment on mortgages made in Florida for primary residences to 5
            percent from 10 percent and down to 10 percent from 20 percent for second homes, according to Bonitatibus.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Those restrictions have handcuffed Florida buyers,' Nunziata said, also referring to
            mortgage insurers and banks. 'When you had restrictions telling buyers they had to put down an extra 5 to 15
            percent in some cases, that eliminated a lot of potential buyers from qualifying.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mortgage
            insurers that restricted coverage during the housing crisis, including MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and
            Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW), have eased underwriting guidelines this year as the market improves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the crash, borrowers in California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona needed a credit score of at
            least 700 and could have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90 percent to qualify for mortgage insurance with
            MGIC, said Sal Miosi, vice president of marketing at the Milwaukee-based firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Added
            Complexity &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, the third-largest U.S. mortgage insurer limited rules so
            borrowers whose loans qualify for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac with credit scores of at least 620
            and a loan-to-value ratio up to 97 percent can get insurance coverage, according to Miosi. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additional
            restrictions 'weren't contributing to the credit quality, they were just adding to complexity,' he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genworth Financial Inc., the fourth-largest mortgage insurer in the country, broadened
            credit guidelines in the first quarter of 2013 and reduced pricing, Rohit Gupta, chief executive officer of
            the company's U.S. mortgage insurance business, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banks are
            still taking a cautious credit posture, according to David H. Stevens, CEO of the Mortgage Bankers
            Association. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You're starting from a very narrow market, so any expansion wouldn't go
            near the reckless lending practices of the early 2000s,' he said. 'We're in the most conservative overall
            credit environment for housing finance that we've seen in almost three decades.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risky
            Lending &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A decrease in access for interest-only loans and those with terms longer than
            30 years led to a slide in a Mortgage Bankers Association measure of loan availability last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those types of loans are less attractive to banks as planned rules created by the Consumer
            Financial Protection Bureau to curb abusive or risky lending kick in next year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Credit
            has been loosening faster for the wealthiest Americans, since bigger loans are mostly put on bank balance
            sheets instead of packaged into securities that get sold to investors. Applications for jumbo mortgages of
            at least $729,000 increased 59 percent in the first four months from a year earlier. Loans of less than
            $150,000, fell by 2.1 percent, according to the MBA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama's
            administration has been pushing to expand homeownership opportunities as families rebuilding from the
            recession face some of the tightest underwriting standards. The president last month introduced new housing
            reforms targeted at middle-class communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borrowers with foreclosures or
            bankruptcies resulting from a job or income loss can now finance a home purchase with an FHA mortgage as
            long as they demonstrate 12 months of timely payments, complete housing counseling and otherwise qualify.
            The FHA, a government mortgage insurer, previously required a three-year wait. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than
            7 million houses have been sold for a loss or lost to foreclosure since 2007, according to RealtyTrac. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The reaction post-bust was a bit extreme but we're returning to more prudent underwriting
            standards,' said Erin Lantz, director of mortgages at Seattle-based Zillow Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Overseas Deposits, JPMorgan Legal Reserves: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
            approved a rule responding to concerns that commercial
            depositors in overseas branches of U.S. banks could be
            disadvantaged in the event of a lender's collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FDIC board members meeting in Washington yesterday
            unanimously voted to adopt a measure responding to U.K.
            regulators' concern that U.S. banks favored domestic depositors
            over foreign-based account holders. The agency in February
            proposed that overseas branches of the U.S. companies make an
            FDIC-estimated $1 trillion in deposits payable in either
            country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of the FDIC's chief concerns was writing a rule that
            walls off the insurance fund from non-U.S. deposits, so the
            final proposal maintained a clear barrier. The adopted version
            was virtually unchanged from the February proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rule is a revision of the agency's definition of
            'insured deposit' to make overseas accounts of corporate
            customers also payable in the U.S. It puts foreign depositors
            who aren't covered by FDIC insurance in line ahead of general
            creditors in a liquidation. About 40 percent of such deposits
            are in the U.K., according to the FDIC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a joint letter to the agency in April, officials from
            Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) and State
            Street Corp. (STT) said that instead of forcing banks to make the
            deposits dually payable, the FDIC could just give the same
            treatment to all global deposits of a bank without extending
            insurance protection -- an effort they acknowledged would have
            required more rulemaking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in February that the rule
            would bring U.S. banks into compliance in the U.K. without
            requiring the institutions to turn their branches into
            subsidiaries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Clearing House Association LLC, a New York-based trade
            group that represents large U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp., described the restructuring of
            foreign-branch deposit agreements as 'administratively
            challenging' and costly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are likely to make their foreign branch deposits
            dually payable only when forced to do so by a foreign regulator
            because of 'negative consequences,' the Clearing House
            Association said in a letter to the FDIC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hedge Funds No Systemic Risk to Australia Financial System &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds pose no systemic risk to Australia's financial
            system, the Australian Securities Investments Commission said
            in a report released on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the report, ASIC identified hedge funds that 'manage
            only a small share of Australia's A$2.1 trillion managed funds
            industry with more than half of these holding less than A$50
            million each.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Australian hedge funds do not currently appear to pose a
            systemic risk to the Australian financial system,' the survey
            indicates. Listed equities represent surveyed hedge fund
            managers' greatest asset exposure, with 32 percent being in
            Australian-listed shares, according to the website report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EU Lawyers Clash Over Legality of 11-Nation Transaction-Tax Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European Union lawyers are clashing over whether a proposed
            11-nation financial-transaction tax is legal under the 28-nation
            bloc's governing treaties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Council of the European Union, which
            represents the executives of EU member states and makes laws in
            tandem with the EU Parliament, say the tax plan goes too far and
            would discriminate against countries that don't participate,
            according to an EU document. The legal service of the European
            Commission, which proposed the levy, stands by the plan and will
            offer a rebuttal, said Emer Traynor, a spokeswoman for EU Tax
            Commissioner Algirdas Semeta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU has proposed a broad-based tax on stocks, bonds,
            derivatives and other trades that could be collected worldwide
            by France, Germany and nine other EU nations that have so far
            signed up. The plan would charge a 0.1 percent rate for stock
            and bond trades and 0.01 percent for derivatives transactions,
            with some exemptions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The feud centers on proposals for worldwide tax collection
            on trades involving a bank or financial security based in one of
            the participating nations. The council's Sept. 6 legal opinion
            said the EU can't justify such an aggressive approach just to
            keep traders from moving outside the participating-nations zone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission's plan exceeds the jurisdiction of
            participating nations, the council opinion said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The council legal opinion was reported earlier by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Boosts Bank's Legal Reserves for Potential Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets,
            increased its litigation reserve by more than $1.5 billion in
            the third quarter to help cover potential legal claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Sept. 9 at the
            Barclays Global Financial Services Conference in New York that
            the 'reserves covers a number of different matters,' and
            there's 'been a crescendo of activity in past weeks,' to which
            the bank is reacting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan added 3,000 employees to bolster internal controls
            and compliance as it grapples with multiple investigations and
            regulatory orders, Lake said. The U.S. is conducting criminal
            investigations linked to the bank's energy-trading and mortgage-backed securities businesses as well as
            separate probes of its
            anti-money-laundering safeguards, foreclosures, credit-card
            collections and a record trading loss in London last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank named two new members to its board and announced
            expanded powers for lead director Lee R. Raymond to help bolster
            risk oversight, according to a company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;SEC Probes Gold Fields on South African Black-Ownership Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) said the U.S. Securities Exchange
            Commission is investigating an ownership deal that helped the
            South African producer of the metal secure a mining license. The
            shares fell to the lowest in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC is probing the transaction associated with the
            grant of the mining permit for the South Deep operation near
            Westonaria, 55 kilometers (34 miles) southwest of Johannesburg,
            Gold Fields said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Gold Fields agreed to issue 600,000 shares to a
            black-owned group and allowed it to buy 10 percent of South
            Deep. South African law requires mining companies to sell at
            least 26 percent of their local operations to black citizens,
            with transactions that benefit workers, communities near sites
            and trusts for the poor being favored. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, the company denied a news report by
            Johannesburg-based Carte Blanche that the deal benefited
            influential people who helped it win the license needed to
            continue operating the mine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the early stage of this investigation, it is not
            possible to estimate reliably what effect the outcome this
            investigation, any regulatory findings, and any related
            developments may have on the company,' Gold Fields said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S investors trade Gold Fields stock through American
            depositary receipts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank Faces Hearing Over Fired Euribor Traders' Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) faces a hearing in a lawsuit by four
            traders fired over the lender's role in the alleged rigging of
            interest benchmarks after mandated mediation failed to produce a
            settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt labor court will hear arguments today over
            whether the four men were wrongfully dismissed by the bank in
            February. Another banker, who was the most junior of the group,
            reached a settlement with the bank, two people familiar with the
            matter said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators from Canada to Switzerland are investigating
            whether more than a dozen lenders, including Deutsche Bank,
            colluded to rig benchmark interest rates. Deutsche Bank has
            fired at least seven employees over suspected misconduct in
            connection with rates. The bank, continental Europe's largest by
            assets, said in February that while it would fire or suspend
            workers that acted inappropriately, it wouldn't identify
            individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank justified the dismissal of the employees by
            saying they had inappropriate communication with a trader the
            bank fired at the end of 2011 for trying to rig rates, one of
            the people familiar with the matter said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter Roelz, a lawyer for the four traders, declined to
            comment on the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The traders fired in February were based in Frankfurt and
            included two managing directors, two directors and a vice
            president, two people with knowledge of the matter said at the
            time. Submitting euro interbank offered rates was part of their
            responsibilities, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A mediation hearing in April didn't yield any results. &lt;/p&gt;

            Commission, testified about U.S. transparency laws and his use
            of his private e-mail account for communications as part of his
            work at the CFTC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Ferriero, the archivist of the U.S., former

            Energy Department loan program director Jonathan Silver, and
            former U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer Andrew McLaughlin
            also testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform

        <headline>Madison Square Garden Enlists JPMorgan to Help Sell Fuse</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG), the
            sports and entertainment company that owns the namesake arena in
            Manhattan, hired JPMorgan Chase Co. to explore a sale of its
            music-TV channel Fuse. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been approached by certain parties expressing
            interest in Fuse and have retained JPMorgan to explore all
            strategic alternatives,' the New York-based company said today
            in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Selling Fuse would let the company's TV business focus on
            its more lucrative sports networks, which broadcast New York
            Knicks and Rangers games. Fuse could be worth $300 million to
            $400 million in a sale, said Amy Yong, an analyst at Macquarie
            Group, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on MSG shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The music channel, which reaches about 64 million
            households, competes with networks such as Viacom Inc. (VIAB)'s MTV and
            VH1 and Mark Cuban's AXS TV. Fuse charges pay-TV providers about
            6 cents per month per customer, according to research firm SNL
            Kagan. That's far less than what popular sports networks fetch. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Madison Square Garden, which also owns real
            estate and sports teams, rose 1.6 percent to $55.99 at the close
            in New York. The stock has gained 26 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York Post reported earlier on the potential sale of
            Fuse. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Trader Fighting Charges Said to Point to Iksil</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Julien Grout, a former JPMorgan (JPM)
            Chase Co. trader charged with trying to hide the bank's record
            trading loss last year, is arguing to prosecutors that he was
            following orders from his then-boss, Bruno Iksil, people with
            knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Grout's lawyers provided records including e-mails to U.S.
            prosecutors in Manhattan in the past two weeks in an effort to
            cast doubt on the government's assertion that Iksil resisted
            pressure to inflate the value of the trades, said the people,
            who asked not to be named because the talks were private. While
            Grout and another supervisor, Javier Martin-Artajo, were charged
            with conspiracy and wire fraud, Iksil -- nicknamed the London
            Whale -- avoided prosecution after agreeing to cooperate with
            authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The exchange shows that Grout, who is fighting accusations
            he improperly marked assets to hide losses, is trying to damage
            his former boss's credibility. In announcing charges against
            Grout and Martin-Artajo last month, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara
            in Manhattan said Iksil had sounded the alarm 'more than once'
            to co-workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It may be part of an attempt to tell the government that
            this case is weaker than you think, and you'll be embarrassed,'
            John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University
            Law School, said of Grout's effort. E-mails are often a matter
            of debate, with defense attorneys trying 'to tell the
            prosecution that they can't go forward because their
            interpretation is wrong.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MD Medical Group Investments Plc,
            which runs Russia's largest chain of maternity centers, gained
            for the first time in a week as JPMorgan Chase Co. raised it
            to buy, citing cheap valuation relative to regional peers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's recommendation on the company, which has a
            market value of $620 million, comes as Aberdeen Asset Management
            Plc sees Russian small-capitalization stocks as 'ridiculously
            cheap' after a sell-off. The MSCI Russia Small Cap Index is
            down 22 percent this year, following a broad decline in the
            country's securities amid concern sanctions against Russia over
            the Ukraine war will squelch economic growth. The U.S. and
            European Union enforced new measures last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MD Medical gained 3.1 percent to $8.25 in London on Sept.
            12, reducing its loss this year to 27 percent. Trading volume of
            67,016 shares was 4.2 times the average of the past three
            months. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index rose 0.4 percent as
            energy exporters including OAO Surgutneftegas and OAO Gazprom
            Neft gained on speculation a weaker ruble will boost profits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cited the stock's 'compelling 30 percent
            discount' to peers in eastern Europe and the Middle East when
            it raised MD Medical from the equivalent of hold. Analyst Elena Jouronova forecast compound annual revenue
            growth of 26 percent
            through 2017 as regional expansion gathers pace, according to an
            e-mailed research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;GDP Slowdown &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growth in Russia's $2 trillion economy has been slowed by
            the international sanctions intended to punish President
            Vladimir Putin for allegedly supporting the rebellion in eastern
            Ukraine, a claim he denies. Barclays Plc., which projects a 0.1
            percent decline in gross domestic product this year and a 0.6
            percent contraction in 2015, said in a Sept. 11 research note
            that new measures 'imply downside risks' to that forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luis Saenz, head of equity sales and trading at BCS
            Financial Group in London, said MD Medical isn't as vulnerable
            to the slowdown as other companies whose revenue comes from
            domestic spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They focus on high-end maternity health care and are
            diversifying operations throughout Russia,' Saenz said by
            phone. 'Even as the economy slows, people won't cut spending on
            maternity health care because it's so critical.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sales Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MD Medical, which has 17 medical centers throughout Russia
            including in Moscow, St.Petersburg, Perm, Samara and Irkutsk,
            said on Aug. 20 that it bought Avicenne Medical Center in
            Novosibirk for $45.5 million. The acquisition will help the
            company increase revenue, according to JP Morgan's Jouronova and
            Saenz of BCS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JP Morgan raised MD Medical's revenue forecast by as 4.6
            percent to $204 million for 2014 and increased its 2015 sales
            estimate by 5.6 percent to $265 million, according to the bank's
            research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Their business model is beautiful, but low liquidity in
            Russian small-capitalization stocks is a problem' Saenz said.
            'Investors are worried about the geopolitical risks and want to
            be able to get in and out of the market quickly.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex Second-Tier Index of companies with lower market
            capitalization fell 1 percent to 2,959.65 last week, extending
            the decline this year to 4.9 percent. The benchmark Micex Index
            dropped 1.1 percent last week to 1,458.52 and is down 3 percent
            this year. The Bloomberg index of the most-trade Russian stocks
            in the U.S. slid 3.3 percent to 85.46 in the five days through
            Sept. 12 and has retreated 16 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fund Flows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Within the Russian space, the small-caps have sold off
            ridiculously,' Peter Taylor, a senior investment manager for
            global emerging markets at Aberdeen Asset Management in London,
            said in an interview on Sept. 5. 'Liquidity has completely
            dried up. There are Russian small caps that are decent
            businesses that are just looking ridiculously cheap.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MD Medical is a 'nice business,' Taylor said. 'The
            management team impresses us and the business model is an
            attractive structural story in Russia and yet that stock has
            just gone so off year-to-date.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures (VEA) on the dollar-denominated RTS index expiring this
            month gained 0.7 percent to 122,230 in U.S. hours on Sept. 12.
            The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
            futures, declined 1.2 percent to 32.19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that tracks the nation's
            stocks, fell 3 percent last
            week to $24.57. It gained 0.5 percent on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia-dedicated funds attracted about $140 million in the
            week through Sept. 10, after outflows in the previous week,
            Cameron Brandt, research director at EPFR Global, a Cambridge,
            Massachusetts-based company that tracks fund flows, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Thomas Lee Starts Research Boutique After JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Thomas Lee, the former JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) chief equity strategist who spent 24 years at some
            of Wall Street's biggest firms, has started a seven-person
            research boutique. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, 45, left New York-based JPMorgan in March to start
            Fundstrat Global Advisors with John Bai, former head of Asia and
            U.S. equity sales at Mizuho Securities, according to a statement
            today from the new company. Lee, who started at Kidder Peabody
            Co. in 1993 and worked at Salomon Smith Barney before joining
            JPMorgan in 1999, will lead a research team of four, while Bai
            oversees sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I've had an itch for a long time to start my own thing,'
            Lee said last week in a telephone interview. Covering the
            wireless industry 'from its infancy basically to its apex'
            over 15 years instilled a desire to attempt to create something
            of his own, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee deferred that wish while being the lead equity
            strategist at the biggest U.S. bank since 2007, calling for
            gains in American stocks for six straight years and getting them
            in four. It was a 'really rough road' being bullish at the
            start of his tenure, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everyone hated equities,' Lee said. 'We turned it into
            something people found a lot of value in, because people began
            to trust us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Accurate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee was bullish at the start of each of six full years as
            chief equity strategist, forecasting an average annual gain of
            14 percent in the Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) over the period.
            He was more accurate than the average of strategist forecasts in
            four of the six years, including 2012 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Fundstrat, Lee will combine an overview of markets,
            similar to his work at JPMorgan, with calls on specific
            industries and stocks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a chance to produce a strategy product that would be
            very difficult' at a big bank, he said. 'It's very difficult
            when you're at JPMorgan to have a view on a stock if the analyst
            has a different view. We are freer to take much more contrarian
            views at the stock level.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another strategist, Deutsche Bank AG's John-Paul Smith, is
            also leaving to start an independent-research firm. Smith, 53,
            is forming Eclectic Strategy with Emad Mostaque, he said in an
            e-mail. Smith was previously at Morgan Stanley, where he
            correctly predicted Russia's stock-market crash in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Client Partnerships &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smaller firms also allow a greater level of partnership
            with clients who don't have to worry that their trades or
            strategy will be shared with thousands of other market
            participants, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks are losing research market share to
            smaller competitors, according to financial-services consulting
            firm Greenwich Associates. Analysts departing big firms say they
            can spend more time on research rather than meeting clients and
            marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee remains optimistic on U.S. equities, which he says are
            in the middle of a bull market that favors value stocks. He
            predicts the SP 500, which closed last week at 1,986, will
            climb 5.8 percent to 2,100 by year-end, up from a previous call
            of 2,075. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market 'creates an opportunity for those who can help
            clients, because the average Wall Street firm isn't providing
            helpful guidance,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Whale Fines Said to Reach at Least $750 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) has agreed to pay at least $750 million to resolve U.S. and U.K.
            regulatory probes of its record trading loss last year, people with knowledge of the negotiations said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is seeking to settle as many inquiries as possible before the third quarter ends Sept. 30,
            the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Chief Financial Officer Marianne
            Lake told investors last week that the quarter's addition to legal reserves would 'more than offset' about
            $1.5 billion of consumer reserve releases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank's bad bets on derivatives, placed by
            U.K. trader Bruno Iksil, prompted authorities on two continents to open investigations into the firm's
            controls and disclosures last year as losses surpassed $6.2 billion. The U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the U.K.'s Financial
            Conduct Authority are among watchdogs planning to sanction the New York-based lender, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some settlements may be announced as early as this week, and total penalties may yet change, one of
            the people said. Iksil, who became known as the London Whale because his trading book was so large, agreed
            in June to testify against his colleagues after U.S. prosecutors promised not to charge him. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Stress Test Shows Lender Can Survive Shock</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest
            U.S. bank, said internal stress tests show the company would
            come through an economic crisis with more than enough capital to
            stay in business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Tier 1 common ratio would be at least 8.5
            percent in a scenario designed to measure how the firm would
            perform during a severe crunch, the New York-based bank said
            today in a presentation on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank would show a net loss before taxes of $0.3 billion
            from the second quarter of 2013 through the middle of 2015, with
            $32.1 billion in loan losses and $17.5 billion in trading and
            counterparty losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks must run their own tests on how they
            would fare during a crisis to supplement those conducted by the
            Federal Reserve six months earlier. The central bank reports
            results each March based on different economic assumptions. The
            most recent round showed 17 of the 18 largest firms surviving a
            deep recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it would have been more conservative in its
            assumptions if it had been able to incorporate feedback from the
            Federal Reserve before running the results in late March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells
            Fargo Co. and Citigroup Inc. also concluded their firms would
            ride out a shock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it could handle a crisis that sends
            stocks down 40 percent and produces $20 billion in trading
            losses for the firm. Bank of America, ranked second by assets
            among U.S. lenders, foresaw a $26.1 billion cumulative deficit.
            Citigroup, ranked third by assets, found it would exceed capital
            minimums even after sustaining about $43 billion in loan losses
            and $10 billion in trading and counterparty losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are based in New York. Bank of
            America has its headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stock advanced 1.1 percent today to $53.14,
            bringing the gain for this year to 21 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit put its
            Century Park property, a Los Angeles office complex where
            Creative Artists Agency has its headquarters, up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management is marketing the 3.2 million-square-foot (297,000-square-meter)
            Century Park on behalf of
            institutional investors, said Darin Oduyoye, a New York-based
            spokesman for the company. The property, located in the Century
            City business district, may fetch more than $2 billion, said a
            person with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be
            identified because the expected price isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complex has two 44-story towers housing high-end
            offices along with stores and restaurants, as well as a 4-acre
            (1.6-hectare) park and the Annenberg Space for Photography. A
            sale may come by the end of the year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC is the broker marketing the complex,
            Oduyoye said. Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil, didn't
            immediately return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) in April planned to market a 21-story
            building at 1888 Century Park East valued at more than $300
            million, two people with knowledge of the effort said at the
            time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management's plans to market Century Park
            were reported earlier today by the Hollywood Reporter. &lt;/p&gt;

            * Bond markets are 'mispricing not only the timing of when this

            * When Argentina settles it will be done 'in a position of

            * Settlement with holdouts probably won't happen before first

        <headline>Ex-JPMorgan Trader's Lawyer Says Client Relied on Whale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Julien Grout, a former JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) trader indicted yesterday in connection with a $6.2
            billion trading loss last year, will be proven innocent, his attorney said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout, who
            reported to Bruno Iksil, was 'totally dependent on Iksil's instructions and relied in good faith on his
            expertise,' Edward Little, a partner at Hughes Hubbard Reed LLP, said today in an e-mailed statement. Iksil,
            known as the London Whale because of the size of his trading portfolio, is cooperating with prosecutors and
            hasn't been charged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout, 35, who moved to his native France from London earlier this
            year, faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted. The indictment against him and Iksil's boss, Javier
            Martin-Artajo, listed five charges against each of them, including securities fraud for allegedly
            manipulating marks on trades to conceal mounting losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It is astonishing that the
            prosecutors are relying on Iksil's testimony when he is the one who taught Mr. Grout how the bank was
            marking the portfolio, gave specific instructions on where he should mark positions, and personally approved
            the marks on a daily basis,' Little said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government's strategy
            'can only be explained by the political pressure' the U.S. Justice Department faces over the trading
            debacle, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grout's Bail &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay more than
            $750 million to end U.S. and U.K. regulatory probes of the trading loss, people familiar with the matter
            said yesterday. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal
            Reserve and the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority are preparing settlements with the New York-based bank,
            the people said. Accords may be announced as early as this week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout's lawyers and
            prosecutors haven't reached an agreement on whether he should be released on bail, and under what
            conditions, if he decides to return to the U.S. to face charges, said a person with direct knowledge of the
            situation, who requested anonymity because the discussions are private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim Margolin, a
            spokesman for U.S. attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout,
            Iksil and Martin-Artajo worked in London at JPMorgan's chief investment office, where the wrong-way
            derivatives bets were made. The loss led to the departure of senior executives, including Chief Investment
            Officer Ina Drew, and spurred the company's board to cut Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon's pay by 50
            percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Traders' Judgment' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grout is accused of mismarking prices
            on the derivatives portfolio. The bank's traders 'had to estimate their fair market value, based not just on
            unreliable dealer quotes, but also on the prices of related securities, market conditions and the traders'
            judgment,' Little said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo was on vacation when prosecutors unsealed charges
            Aug. 14, according to a statement that week from his attorneys at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP. He turned
            himself in to Spanish police Aug. 27, a police official there said at the time. Martin-Artajo was released
            on bail in Madrid and said he was unwilling to be extradited, a spokeswoman for the National Court said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S. District Court, Southern District
            of New York (Manhattan). The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-05677,
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>JPMorgan Index Seen Rupee Savior as Singh Tinkers: India Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Global investors and strategists
            say India needs to remove all limits on investing in its bond
            market, after a move to cut red tape helped bolster the rupee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lombard Odier Investment Management and Aletti Gestielle
            Sgr SpA say such opening would allow India to join major bond
            indexes, boosting inflows. Inclusion in JPMorgan Chase Co.'s
            GBI-Global Diversified Index of emerging-market government debt
            could lure as much as $40 billion over 12 months, according to
            Standard Chartered Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee rose 1 percent yesterday as Prime Minister
            Manmohan Singh allowed foreigners to buy sovereign debt without
            quotas until holdings reach 90 percent of the overall $30
            billion limit. The currency slumped 14 percent as investors
            pulled $8.9 billion from local notes in three months through
            Aug. 31. Standard Chartered says inclusion in major indexes
            would limit outflows during such panic selling as investors
            can't stray too far from their benchmark's performance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Removing the cap on debt investment is a progressive step
            which policy makers should consider,' said Nagaraj Kulkarni, a
            strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore. 'The latest
            measure is a welcome simplification of an existing process. This
            alone will be insufficient to reverse the recent outflows.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rule change announced by Securities and Exchange Board
            of India after trading hours on Sept. 13 follows an earlier
            decision to remove the need for foreign institutional investors
            to buy quotas for acquiring corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investment Limit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regular overseas investors can buy as much as $25 billion
            of government bonds and an extra investment of a maximum $5
            billion is permitted for long-term investors such as sovereign
            wealth funds. Both categories of foreigners held a combined 659
            billion rupees ($10.4 billion) of debt as of Sept. 16, official
            data show. Overseas funds held $138.5 billion of equities as of
            Sept. 13, according to exchange data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign investors own about 2 percent of India's $550
            billion of rupee-denominated sovereign debt compared with 41
            percent in Malaysia and 31 percent each in Indonesia and Brazil,
            Standard Chartered estimated in a Sept. 12 research note.
            Romania's inclusion in JPMorgan GBI-EM index in March was
            estimated to boost inflows by $2 billion, while the addition of
            Nigerian debt in October last year was seen to lure $1.5 billion
            to the country, according analysts at the U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Darrell Wright, head of communications and media relations
            at JPMorgan in Singapore, said the lender couldn't immediately
            comment on India's case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Portfolio Inflows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We would expect portfolio inflows to pick up as India
            joins global indices,' said Holger Friedrich, who manages $490
            million of bonds in London at Lombard Odier Investment
            Manangement. 'It would be helpful in the long run, if combined
            with reasonable macro long-term measures addressing structural
            weaknesses, not just short-term steps to fix the currency
            weakness.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit of Lombard Odier Cie., a Geneva-based private
            bank that managed $183 billion globally as of June, has a quota
            to buy Indian government debt, Friedrich said in a Sept. 13
            telephone interview. The notes have a 7 percent weight in its
            in-house index for local-currency debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on India's 7.16 percent rupee-denominated bond
            due May 2023 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
            to 8.395 percent as of 2:08 p.m. in Mumbai, according to central
            bank prices. It reached a five-year high of 9.24 percent on Aug.
            19. The rupee fell 0.4 percent to 63.11 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring bonds of State Bank of India (SBIN),
            considered a proxy for the government by some investors, against
            non-payment for five years fell 5 basis points yesterday to 326,
            a sixth day of decline, according to data provider CMA. The
            credit-default swaps surged 106 basis points in August, the most
            since October 2008, and reached a 14-month high of 372 on Aug.
            20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Twin Deficits &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's currency and bonds have declined this year as
            Asia's third-largest economy expanded 4.4 percent last quarter
            from a year earlier, the least since the three months ended
            March 2009, and amid the nation's twin current-account and
            budget deficits. Foreign investors pulled $3.7 billion from
            stocks in the three months through Aug. 31 as capital fled
            emerging markets amid prospects of the Federal Reserve reducing
            its record stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the current account, the broadest measure
            of trade, widened to a record 4.8 percent of GDP in the year
            ended March 31, official data show. The Reserve Bank of India
            considers the gap the biggest risk to India's economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In January 2012, then RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
            that though limits for foreign investment in corporate and
            government debt have been expanded marginally, the changes were
            only meant to gauge market appetite and were not a sign that
            caps will be increased further. The central bank prefers non-debt flows over debt flows, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Yield Swings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The perception that higher bond inflows would stoke market
            volatility isn't entirely true, Standard Chartered's Kulkarni
            said. Data compiled by the U.K. lender show yield swings in the
            past three years have been larger in India than in markets like
            South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand that have embraced larger
            inflows, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To be eligible for inclusion in global bond indexes India
            shouldn't have explicit capital controls, must allow its
            currency to be freely traded and encourage foreign
            participation, Standard Chartered said in its report, citing
            criteria for benchmarks compiled by banks including JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'India will see committed long-term flows if some of the
            caps are eased, and that will benefit its economy and investor
            community,' Walter Rossini, who oversees $200 million of Indian
            assets at Aletti Gestielle in Milan, said in a Sept. 12
            telephone interview. 'It will lift confidence by more than just
            a notch.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dimon Tells JPMorgan to Brace for More Regulatory Woes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told employees to prepare for more
            legal woes while the bank undertakes an 'unprecedented effort'
            to comply with regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are all well aware of the news around the legal and
            regulatory issues facing our company, and in the coming weeks
            and months we need to be braced for more to come,' Dimon said
            today in an e-mail to JPMorgan's more than 250,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, increased spending on
            internal controls by about $1 billion this year and dedicated
            more than $750 million 'to address several of our consent
            orders,' Dimon said. At least 5,000 people at the New York-based company have been assigned to compliance,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will pay at least $750 million to close some
            regulatory probes into its record London Whale trading loss last
            year, people familiar with the matter said. That includes about
            $200 million to resolve Securities and Exchange Commission
            claims, a person with knowledge of the matter said today,
            requesting anonymity because the agreement isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has been
            investigating whether the bank manipulated trading in credit
            derivatives, is unlikely to announce a settlement at the same
            time as the other regulators, according to people familiar with
            the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) unit put its
            Century Park property, a Los Angeles office complex where
            Creative Artists Agency has its headquarters, up for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan Asset Management is marketing the 3.2 million-square-foot (297,000-square-meter)
            Century Park on behalf of
            institutional investors, said Darin Oduyoye, a New York-based
            spokesman for the company. The property, located in the Century
            City business district, may fetch more than $2 billion, said a
            person with knowledge of the plans who asked not to be
            identified because the expected price isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complex has two 44-story towers housing high-end
            offices along with stores and restaurants, as well as a 4-acre
            (1.6-hectare) park and the Annenberg Space for Photography. A
            sale may come by the end of the year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eastdil Secured LLC is the broker marketing the complex,
            Oduyoye said. Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil, didn't
            return a telephone call seeking comment late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) in April planned to market a 21-story

            were reported yesterday by the Hollywood Reporter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Writes Off Brazil Bond Pickup as Elections Loom</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Companies in Brazil are shunning
            the local bond market on speculation President Dilma Rousseff,
            who's presided over an economy plagued by surging inflation and
            a lack of growth, will be re-elected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate borrowers have issued 35.44 billion reais ($15.24
            billion) of bonds in the first eight months of the year, a 7.8
            percent decrease from a year ago and the least since 2010,
            according to the most recent data from Anbima, Brazil's capital
            markets association. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the first round of elections less than three weeks
            away, polls show Rousseff is regaining the popular support she
            lost earlier this month. That's revived concern a victory by the
            incumbent will mean four more years of fiscal policies that led
            to Brazil's first recession since 2009, which may deter
            companies from borrowing to expand, according to JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Banco Votorantim SA. This month, companies have issued
            2 billion reais of bonds, less than half as much as a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies are waiting 'until there is more clarity on what
            the next government will be like,' Ricardo Leoni, the head of
            Brazil's debt capital markets at JPMorgan, said in a telephone
            interview from Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials from the president's office didn't reply to e-mails and a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Assuming Rousseff is one of the top finishers in first-round voting on Oct. 5, she would then
            probably garner 41
            percent of the vote in an Oct. 26 election runoff, according to
            a Vox Populi poll released Sept. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dead Heat &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That puts her in a statistical tie with opposition
            candidate Marina Silva, who received support from 42 percent of
            those polled. The Sept. 13-14 survey of 2,000 people has a
            margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. Silva's lead was seven
            percentage points in an Aug. 31-Sept. 2 poll. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An Ibope poll published yesterday showed a runoff between
            Rousseff and Marina Silva would be too close to call while
            backing for third-place candidate Aecio Neves increased.
            Rousseff would win 36 percent of voter support in the first
            round, with 30 percent for Silva and 19 percent for Neves,
            according to the Sept. 13-15 survey. In an Oct. 26 runoff, Silva
            would have 43 percent of voter support, compared with 40 percent
            for Rousseff, according to the poll published on Jornal Nacional
            television. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the past three weeks, Rousseff has stepped up attacks
            against Silva, saying the former environment minister doesn't
            have the experience to lead and would reduce investments in
            offshore oil and gas reserves. Silva says the incumbent's
            policies contributed to a recession in the first half of this
            year and quicker inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Government's Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since taking office in January 2011, Rousseff has increased
            the government's role in companies, changing concession-renewal
            rules to lower electricity rates and capping gasoline prices to
            tame inflation that last month exceed the 6.5 percent limit of
            the central bank's target range. Policy makers raised the
            benchmark interest rate by 3.75 percentage points over nine
            straight meetings through April before holding it at a two-year
            high of 11 percent for the past three. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Latin America's largest economy shrank 0.6 percent in the
            April-June period from the previous three months, after
            contracting 0.2 percent in the first quarter, the national
            statistics agency said Aug. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real declined 0.3 percent to 2.3388 per dollar today as
            of 2:40 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Average Rates &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva has promised to cut inflation by half and called for
            a fiscal-responsibility body to independently monitor budgets
            and spending to verify that the government is complying with
            fiscal targets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average interest rate on floating-rate local bonds with
            maturities longer than 12 months issued this year was 10.99
            percent, 0.12 percentage point above the average in the same
            span last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This has been a tough year for local companies, with all
            the concerns regarding politics and the economic scenario we'll
            have starting next year,'Carolina Lacerda, the head of
            investment banking at UBS AG's Brazil unit and a director at
            Anbima, said in an interview in Sao Paulo. 'Companies are
            cautious, especially because the cost of funding, in general, is
            at a very high level.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Brazilian companies are staying away from the local
            debt market, they're boosting overseas offerings to lock in
            borrowing costs before U.S. policy makers raise interest rates.
            They have issued $42.7 billion this year, a 45 percent increase
            from the same period in 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growth Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ricardo Carvalho, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said that if
            economic growth begins to recover later this year, issuance in
            the local market will probably rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazilian companies aren't selling bonds 'because they are
            not spending much,' he said in an interview in Sao Paulo.
            'That could change once the economy starts to improve, which
            could happen before the end of this semester.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Carvalho sees the potential for growth to accelerate,
            Moody's Investors Service cut the outlook on Brazil's credit
            rating to negative on Sept. 9, saying the economy is unlikely to
            rebound in the short term. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Companies seem to be waiting for what will happen in the
            macroeconomic scenario and after elections before selling more
            debt,' Reinaldo Lacerda, who helps manage 43 billion reais in
            assets as the investment director at the wealth management
            division of Banco Votorantim SA, said in an interview in Sao
            Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Iron Ore Slump No Bar to Rio, BHP Buybacks at JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore's slump to a five-year low
            isn't expected to prevent the world's two biggest miners, BHP
            Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group (RIO), returning cash to investors,
            a JPMorgan Chase Co. fund manager said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have to remember the very large operating margins
            which can still be achieved within iron ore,' James Sutton, a
            portfolio manager at JPMorgan's $1.6 billion Natural Resources
            Fund in London, said in an interview. There's 'a lot of scope
            for shareholder returns,' as Rio and BHP are curbing investment
            in marginal projects, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The steel-making ingredient slumped to the lowest in five
            years this month prompting Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to declare
            the 'end of the Iron Age' after a Chinese-led demand spike
            over the last decade prompted record profits for BHP and Rio. As
            investors demand a greater share of mining industry profits, the
            largest iron ore producers are flooding the market with new
            supply, trimming prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Looking at the bigger picture, I think that the two
            things are not incompatible,' Sutton said. 'These businesses
            will have to get used to a lower iron ore price environment.
            They may become more boring as a result and focus on those core
            assets and focus on getting more and more margin out of them.
            That will ultimately lead to higher dividends and buybacks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Natural Resources fund has Rio as its fourth-largest holding, with a 4.7 percent
            weighting, and BHP as it the
            sixth at 4.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's 37 percent decline in iron ore was partly
            responsible for BHP shying away from a widely anticipated
            buyback last month, chief executive officer of the world's
            biggest mining company Andrew Mackenzie said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Disappoint Again &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We fear the group could again disappoint (excessively
            high) market expectations on capital return next year,' if
            prices for iron ore and copper fail to rebound sharply, Exane
            BNP Paribas analysts led by Luc Pez wrote in a report this week
            in which BHP was downgraded to underperform. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto CEO Sam Walsh, who derives almost 90 percent of
            the London-based company's earnings from the iron ore division,
            last month described the world's second-biggest iron ore
            exporter as a 'cash machine' as a cost-cutting drive starts to
            bear fruit. The company has a vision to 'deliver on increased
            shareholder returns,' he said in an Aug. 8 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Chinese Port &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of
            Tianjin fell 0.8 percent yesterday to $84.50 a dry ton,
            according to The Steel Index. Prices retreated to $81.90 a ton
            on Sept. 11, the lowest level since September 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At current prices we think they will announce a
            significant dividend increase and a buyback,' said Rob
            Clifford, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, who rates
            Rio Tinto a buy. 'I'm convinced that today's iron ore price
            remains above both BHP and Rio's internal view of what long term
            prices are ,so as far as they're concerned they're still making
            excess margins on iron ore.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, the price may find a floor near $80 a ton as lower
            cost Australian supplies displace higher cost Chinese
            production, according to JPMorgan's Sutton. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hit a Floor &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are seeing increasing signs of production falling off
            in China and other parts of the world as well being displaced by
            this very low cost Australian production which is coming on
            stream ahead of time,' he said. 'We might be starting to hit a
            floor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mine closures around the world spurred by the slump in
            prices will help the price to level out, according to the
            government forecaster in Australia, the world's biggest
            exporter. It may average $90 a ton to $95 a ton over the next
            five years, according to Wayne Calder, deputy executive director
            at the Canberra-based Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The expanding global glut will more than triple to 163
            million tons next year from 52 million this year, according to
            Goldman. The surplus is seen expanding to 245 million tons in
            2016, 295 million tons in 2017 and 334 million tons in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Said to Pay $900 Million to Settle Whale Probes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) is poised to
            pay about $900 million to settle U.S. and U.K. claims that lax
            internal controls led the bank to provide inaccurate information
            about last year's record trading loss to the board, investors
            and regulators, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is set to announce deals today with four
            regulators over its handling of the trades by an employee known
            as the London Whale because his bets were so large, the people
            said, requesting anonymity because talks were private.
            Separately, the firm may also pay less than $80 million to
            settle two watchdogs' probes tied to consumer lending practices,
            two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, whose pay was cut in
            half last year after the board said he was partially responsible
            for faulty oversight of the trades, told employees in a Sept. 17
            memo the bank is making an 'unprecedented effort' to simplify
            its business, overhaul controls and improve relations with
            regulators. The firm has been beset by inquiries this year,
            including the emergence last month of an investigation into its
            hiring practices in Asia as well as criminal probes tied to
            mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The package of penalties to be announced today is a message
            to banks 'that regulators are going to really ratchet up the
            fines if the organization is deemed too big to manage in order
            to get the organization to simplify their structure,' said
            Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $389 Million Over Regulators' Card Add-On Claims</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, is paying $389 million in penalties and
            restitution to settle regulators' claims that it unfairly
            charged customers for credit-monitoring products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank will pay $60 million to the Office
            of the Comptroller of the Currency and $20 million to the
            Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in penalties for improperly
            billing customers for the 'add-on products,' the agencies said
            in a statement today. JPMorgan has already paid $309 million in
            refunds to more than 2.1 million customers, CFPB Director
            Richard Cordray said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Put simply, Chase was charging consumers for services
            they did not receive,' Cordray said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An investigation started by the OCC revealed that JPMorgan
            enrolled customers in credit-monitoring programs that were sold
            as add-ons to credit cards from October 2005 through June 2012,
            the consumer bureau said. The bank began charging customers for
            the programs before obtaining the necessary written
            authorization, the regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010,
            is conducting an industrywide inquiry into various aspects of
            the add-on market, including whether credit-card customers were
            unknowingly enrolled in products such as credit-monitoring
            services and whether banks properly oversaw contractors that
            helped sell them. The probe has yielded settlements with
            companies including Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which agreed to
            pay $210 million in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Wallace, the bank's head of operations for consumer
            and community banking, said in an e-mailed statement that the
            company's Chase Bank unit had stopped new enrollments in the
            products in mid-2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'High Standards' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
            committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
            to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,'
            Wallace said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank still faces a CFPB investigation, disclosed last
            month in a regulatory filing, over credit card debt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier today, the OCC was involved in two other
            settlements with JPMorgan. It was among several regulators in
            the $920 million agreement to settle allegations stemming from
            the bank's London Whale losses. The OCC also ordered the bank
            repay harmed customers and fix problems with its consumer debt-collections practices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Asset Management Unit Buying Emerging-Market Securities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s $1.5
            trillion asset management unit is buying emerging-market and
            convertible bonds as it seeks higher-yielding securities with
            the Federal Reserve maintaining its stimulus effort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'All asset prices are going to be underwritten by central
            banks for the foreseeable future,' Robert Michele, JPMorgan
            Asset Management's chief investment officer of fixed income and
            currencies, said today on Bloomberg Television's 'Market
            Makers' with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle. 'There are
            many parts of the bond market that look attractive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michele said the firm is buying 'equity-like' fixed-income securities, including local
            emerging-market debt, bank
            capital contingent notes and convertible bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are bolstered by the Fed's decision yesterday to
            maintain its $85 billion of monthly Treasury and mortgage-debt
            purchases, surprising economists who expected the central bank
            to start slowing the stimulus program. The greatest proportion
            of fixed-income buyers are more 'overweight' investment-grade
            corporate bonds since February 2011, according to a September
            survey by JPMorgan strategists led by Eric Beinstein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year government note plunged
            16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 2.69 percent
            yesterday, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, the
            biggest drop since Oct. 31, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Defensive' Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds in the U.S. are returning 0.4 percent this
            month, paring a 4.3 percent loss in the previous four months as
            concern mounted that the Fed would start slowing its
            unprecedented stimulus effort. U.S. policy makers said yesterday
            they want more evidence of an economic recovery before reducing
            its quantitative-easing program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors had become very defensive over the summer and
            raised a lot of cash,' Michele said. 'You start to sense that
            the market is oversold.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds from developing nations are returning 1.3
            percent this month, the biggest gain since October, according to
            the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Emerging Markets Corporate
            Plus Index, as confidence increases that easy monetary policies
            will keep supporting riskier debt markets. A Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index of convertible notes is returning 4.5
            percent this month, the most since January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) agreed to
            repay harmed consumers and fix problems with its handling of
            credit-card debt collections under an agreement with the U.S.
            Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank violated rules regarding
            collections practices, debt documents and sales of consumer
            credit-card debt, the OCC said in a consent order. JPMorgan, the
            biggest U.S. bank by assets, must provide remediation to
            affected customers, improve its documentation procedures with
            non-home loans and review lending accounts since 2005 for
            deficiencies that need to be repaired, the OCC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to the sanctions without admitting or
            denying wrongdoing, according to today's order. The settlement
            was announced at the same time as a separate $920 million
            agreement with multiple regulators over the bank's London Whale
            trades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The unsafe or unsound practices identified by the OCC
            were most prevalent in the Bank's consumer and community banking
            lines of business, including credit-card services, auto lending,
            and student lending,' according to the order. The bank's
            employees -- or those of hired third-party firms -- signed
            affidavits that they personally reviewed debt documents that
            'were not based on such personal knowledge or review of the
            relevant books and records.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will review files and submit a plan to the
            regulator on how it intends to repay those harmed. Because the
            plan isn't yet approved, the amount of remediation isn't set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Steps Taken &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have taken extensive steps over the past two years to
            remediate the issues that affected customers and redesign our
            practices,' said Bill Wallace, the bank's head of operations
            for consumer and community banking, in a statement. 'Although
            these issues affected less than 1 percent of Chase customers,
            any mistake is regrettable and does not reflect the high
            standards we set for ourselves.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The problems were discovered by the bank in its own
            internal reviews in 2010, it said in a statement. JPMorgan said
            it stopped filing credit-card collection lawsuits against
            customers in early 2011 and hasn't restarted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial
            Protection Bureau, has also made the debt collection industry a
            top priority this year. His agency, which has been focusing on
            the accuracy of information used to collect debts, is
            investigating JPMorgan's practices, the bank said in a
            Securities and Exchange Commission filing last month. The
            consumer agency may write a regulation to create nationwide
            industry standards, Cordray said on July 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in its SEC filing that it had responded to
            formal and informal inquiries from both federal and state
            regulators on credit-card collections. In May, the bank was sued
            by the California attorney general for violating state laws on
            the use of sworn documents in debt collection and taking illegal
            shortcuts to pursue borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan No. 1 Stock Picker for Fifth Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When Citigroup Inc. (C) announced a plan to fire thousands of workers and scale back international
            operations in December 2012, it looked like one more piece of bad news for the big bank, which went on to
            fail its second consecutive U.S. Federal Reserve stress test. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS)
            Inc. analyst Richard Ramsden didn't see it that way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 3, Ramsden lifted his
            rating on the New York'based bank to what Goldman calls a conviction buy, even though the shares were near a
            17-week high and some analysts thought they were poised for a downturn, Bloomberg Markets magazine will
            report in its October issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The strategy we had going into 2013 was to look for
            restructuring stories that we felt were mispriced, and Citigroup was one,' Ramsden says. 'We felt that the
            stronger banks had already done a pretty good job reducing funding costs and expenses and had less room to
            grow earnings.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: The Dumb Money Is Getting Smarter Every Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's
            shares surged 26 percent in the 11 months following his call, beating the Standard Poor's 500 Index.
            Ramsden's confidence in Citi didn't last out the year. On Dec. 3, he cut the rating to a hold and assigned a
            strong buy rating to U.S. Bancorp. (USB) He was right again. Citigroup slipped 8.5 percent through the end
            of the first quarter of 2014, while U.S. Bancorp climbed 9.9 percent over the period. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to Pay $920 Million, Ex-SAC Analyst: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), seeking to
            end probes of a $6.2 billion trading debacle, admitted to
            violating federal securities laws and agreed to pay about $920
            million for failing to implement adequate controls and providing
            incomplete information to regulators and its board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senior management knew in April 2012 that the bank's chief
            investment office in London, which was responsible for the loss,
            was using aggressive valuations that hid $750 million in losses,
            the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday in a
            statement. Some executives 'expressed reservations' at signing
            off on JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings filings last year as
            required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement resolves claims by the SEC, the U.S. Office
            of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve and the U.K.
            Financial Conduct Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company was fined 137.6 million pounds ($221.2 million)
            by U.K. regulators as part of a probe into last year's record
            trading loss, the Financial Conduct Authority said on its
            website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department and Commodity Futures Trading
            Commission are among agencies still investigating the trading
            loss at the CIO, a unit of the New York-based bank that was
            supposed to help reduce risk and manage excess deposits.
            JPMorgan said yesterday that it was notified by the CFTC that
            its staff intends to recommend enforcement action. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The more than $6.2 billion in losses led to the indictment
            of two former traders this week, the departure of at least four
            senior managers and a blow to the reputation of Chief Executive
            Officer Jamie Dimon, 57, whose pay was cut in half. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan restated results and its market value fell by
            almost $51 billion after disclosing errant bets made by Bruno
            Iksil, a trader who became known as the London Whale because his
            positions were so large. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707,
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
            Martin-Artajo, 13-cv-05677, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Insurers Agree to Audit Workplace Pension Plans in OFT Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. insurers agreed to audit some pension plans as part of
            a settlement with regulators reviewing the 275 billion-pound
            ($442 billion) market for defined contribution workplace
            pensions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fees for the pension plans are too high and not always
            transparent to consumers, the Office of Fair Trading said in a
            report yesterday. The Association of British Insurers agreed to
            conduct an immediate audit of older and high-charging contract
            and bundled-trust schemes, containing about 30 billion pounds of
            savings, to ensure participants understand the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator began an investigation into defined
            contribution workplace pension plans in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We agree with the OFT that it is important to review
            charges to ensure they represent good value for money for
            today's employers and savers,' Otto Thoresen, the ABI's
            director general, said in a statement. 'Pension providers have
            agreed to an audit of all legacy and higher charging schemes to
            ensure any problems can be sorted out.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents
            U.K. workplace pension plans and their members, said the report
            didn't go far enough to give companies more choices of pension
            plans to offer their employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BMC Software Loses Repatriation Case in U.S. Tax Court &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BMC Software Inc. faces a $12.9 million tax bill after the
            U.S. Tax Court upheld a finding by the Internal Revenue Service
            that some earnings repatriated in the mid-2000s were ineligible
            for a temporarily lower tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BMC, based in Houston, contended that accounts receivable
            on its books shouldn't be counted as debt that would reduce the
            amount of money it could bring to the U.S. from foreign
            affiliates at the reduced tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judge Diane Kroupa disagreed, ruling that the IRS's
            'treatment of the accounts receivable are consistent with the
            dictionary definition' and 'may constitute indebtedness' for
            purposes of calculating how much in earnings could be taxed at
            the lower rate in effect at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ann Duhon, a spokeswoman for BMC, said she hadn't seen the
            ruling and had no immediate comment. Christine Vaughn, of Vinson
            Elkins LLP, an attorney on the case for BMC, didn't
            immediately reply to a phone message requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2004 repatriation program permitted U.S. corporations
            to bring home income held outside the U.S. at an effective rate
            of 5.25 percent instead of the top 35 percent corporate income
            tax rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BMC claimed $709 million in earnings qualified for the tax
            holiday. The IRS ruled that $43 million was ineligible for
            taxation at the lower rate because it represented a foreign
            unit's debt to BMC created by accounts receivable, according to
            court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is BMC Software Inc. v. IRS, 15675-11, U.S. Tax
            Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ex-SAC Analyst Dennis Called Uncharged Co-Conspirator by U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ron Dennis, a former SAC Capital Advisors LP analyst, is an
            uncharged co-conspirator in an insider-trading scheme involving
            SAC portfolio manager Michael Steinberg, U.S. prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steinberg, the long-serving portfolio manager at the
            Stamford, Connecticut-based fund charged in the government's
            probe of insider trading, was indicted by a grand jury in
            Manhattan, according to documents unsealed on March 29. He's
            scheduled to go on trial Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. alleges Steinberg engaged in insider trading in
            Dell Inc. (DELL) and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) based on illicit tips provided to him
            by his analyst, Jon Horvath. The former analyst, who has pleaded
            guilty and is cooperating with the U.S., is scheduled to be a
            witness at Steinberg's trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a memo to Steinberg's lawyers providing details on the
            alleged conspiracy, prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S.
            Attorney Preet Bharara said Horvath and Dennis were part of a
            group of six analysts who obtained and passed nonpublic
            information about stocks in at least 10 other technology
            companies including Volterra Semiconductor Corp. (VLTR) and PMCS Sierra
            Inc. Some of the tips were passed to former Diamondback Capital
            Management LLC analyst Jesse Tortora, according to prosecutors.
            Tortora has pleaded guilty to insider trading and is cooperating
            with the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steinberg faces as long as 20 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen
            Co., declined to comment on the government's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cisco Officials Accused of Role in Falun Gong Monitoring &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese and U.S. citizens accusing Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) of
            conspiring with China's government to monitor and torture
            members of Falun Gong, a religious practice, have now said
            officials at the company's headquarters in San Jose, California,
            were directly involved with human rights abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cisco's main office helped design the surveillance and
            internal security network known as 'Golden Shield,' according
            to an amended lawsuit filed Sept. 18 in federal court in San
            Jose. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The revised complaint 'more directly ties' Cisco and its
            San Jose headquarters to human rights abuses against Falun Gong,
            the plaintiffs said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In their suit against Cisco, the world's biggest networking
            equipment maker, unidentified Chinese and U.S. citizens alleged
            that the company has collaborated with the Chinese Communist
            Party to intercept communications of Falun Gong believers, who
            were arrested, detained and tortured because of their religious
            beliefs. The claim was originally filed in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Cisco continues to believe the entire case is without
            merit and will file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint,'
            spokeswoman Kristin Carvell said Sept. 18 in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs have recycled previous allegations to try to
            overcome a Supreme Court decision that the claims can't be
            brought in U.S. courts, Carvell said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Doe I v. Cisco Systems Inc., 11-cv-02449, U.S.
            District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Underfunded CFTC Hasn't Grown Much in 20 Years, Gensler Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is
            underfunded and needs more money to be an effective regulator,
            Chairman Gary Gensler said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency is 'only slightly larger' than it was 20 years
            ago, he said. Gensler made the remarks at a conference yesterday
            in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We didn't oversee swaps 20 years ago, we didn't have
            electronic trading,' Gensler said. 'It's critical for the
            public's confidence in a market that a regulator is well-funded.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ASX Board Members Resign After SEC Action Against Hedge Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shane Finemore and Russell Aboud resigned from the board of
            ASX Ltd. (ASX) after their hedge fund, Manikay Partners LLC, agreed to
            settle claims of improperly buying shares of companies they had
            bet against. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aboud said by phone yesterday that he told ASX Chairman
            Rick Holliday Smith he would resign. New York-based Manikay
            agreed to pay $2.6 million to settle the action. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hedge fund was sanctioned by the U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission as part of an enforcement against 23 firms,
            the agency said in a statement Sept. 17. Aboud, a member of the
            ASX board, is chairman of the fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said while he doesn't believe there are governance
            issues at ASX, 'even a perception of an issue has the ability
            to damage' the company. Therefore, resigning was the right
            thing to do, he said. Aboud said the action stemmed from a
            Citigroup Inc. (C) share sale in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ASX board member Finemore is the managing partner of
            Manikay. Finemore didn't respond to e-mailed requests for
            comment. The company made no admission of guilt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ASX confirmed the two resignations in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms cited in the cases allegedly bought shares from
            an underwriter, broker or dealer participating in a share sale
            after having sold short the same security during the restricted
            period, according to the SEC statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The company appointed the banks as joint book runners for
            an initial public offering this year, the people said, declining
            to be identified because the matter isn't public. Senaat Chief
            Financial Officer Jassem Saleh Busaibe declined to comment, as
            did a spokesman for HSBC. Calls to JPMorgan's media office in
            London outside of office hours weren't immediately answered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senaat is among United Arab Emirates' companies planning
            share sales after stock values surged. Abu Dhabi's benchmark ADX
            General Index gained 45 percent this year, while the government
            forecasts average economic growth of 4.6 percent between 2012
            and 2015, more than twice as fast as the previous four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senaat, which also owns Emirates Steel Industries PJSC,
            posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to 12.3 billion dirhams ($3.3
            billion) in 2012, while assets rose 8 percent to 25.4 billion
            dirhams, according to a statement on the company's website.
            Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation
            rose 8 percent to 2.3 billion dirhams in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Just Falafel, the U.A.E. fast-food chain, is weighing the
            sale of a 25 percent stake in an initial public offering, two
            people with knowledge of the matter said last week. Gulf
            Capital, the Abu Dhabi-based private equity firm, hired
            Rothschild to advise on a share sale of its Gulf Marine unit,
            while private equity firm Abraaj Group is planning an IPO of its
            Stanford Marine Group unit in London. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tesla Falls After JPMorgan Outlines Cautious Estimates</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) fell to the
            lowest level in six weeks after a JPMorgan Chase Co. analyst
            projected a share price of less than $200, suggesting fewer
            vehicle sales than are implied by battery-factory plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares fell 3.6 percent to $250.03 at the close in New
            York, the lowest price since Aug. 8. The stock has risen 66
            percent this year, outpacing a 7.7 percent gain by the Russell
            1000 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company led by Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is
            targeting an annualized production rate of 100,000 premium
            electric cars by the end of 2015. Palo Alto, California-based
            Tesla may produce only 18,250 sedans and sport-utility vehicles
            in next year's fourth quarter for a run-rate of 73,000, Ryan
            Brinkman, an auto-industry analyst with JPMorgan, said in an e-mail to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the automaker has indicated with its plan to build a
            massive battery factory that it aims to produce 500,000 vehicles
            a year, JPMorgan projected 303,500 cars assembled in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla is building a factory near Reno, Nevada, to provide
            cheaper lithium-ion cells for its vehicles. The plant may cost
            as much as $5 billion, Tesla said. The company raised about $2.3
            billion toward the plant in March. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Mortgage-Unit Garry Cipponeri Said to Leave Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Garry Cipponeri, the head of
            capital markets for JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s U.S. mortgage unit,
            is leaving the bank to start a new company, according to two
            people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cipponeri, a senior vice president who joined JPMorgan in
            2004 from Citigroup Inc., is planning to start a firm called
            TradeRoom Capital Partners that will trade mortgages that
            haven't been packaged into bonds and do consulting, said the
            people, who asked not to be named because the decision hasn't
            been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He declined to comment when reached by telephone, as did
            Jason Lobo, a spokesman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the second-largest U.S. home lender after Wells
            Fargo Co., according to newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance.
            Cipponeri often represented the bank during panels at industry
            events, such as a Mortgage Bankers Association conference in New
            York in May and a workshop sponsored by the Federal Reserve
            Banks of Boston and New York in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mercuria Unit to Be Regulated by FCA as JPMorgan Deal Nears</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. said one
            of its trading units fell under the U.K.'s Financial Conduct
            Authority for the first time as it seeks to expand services in
            European financial commodity markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Europe Trading Ltd. is authorized and regulated by
            the FCA under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the
            Geneva-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria, nearing completion of a $3.5 billion deal to buy
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s physical commodity operation, joins
            Glencore Plc and Trafigura Beheer BV in having part of its
            business regulated by the FCA. After decades of operating in
            relative secrecy, the acquisition of physical assets is pushing
            independent commodity traders to increase disclosure as they
            seek new sources of financing, including bond sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As Mercuria's business model continues to evolve to
            expand its provision of services, so too does the regulatory
            oversight of Mercuria,' Victoria Attwood Scott, the firm's head
            of compliance, said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Attwood Scott, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive,
            said in April that Mercuria was in discussions with the FCA to
            determine whether the purchase of JPMorgan's European gas and
            power operations would require regulatory oversight by the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growing Fast &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded a decade ago by former Goldman Sachs traders Marco Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi, Mercuria is
            growing faster than
            Trafigura, Gunvor Group Ltd. and Vitol Group, the world's
            largest oil trader. As investment banks such as JPMorgan pull
            back from physical commodities because of rising regulatory
            scrutiny, Mercuria is seeking to combine such operations with
            investment bank-style commodity futures and options trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria's FCA application isn't the first by a foreign-based commodity trading firm. A unit of
            Baar, Switzerland-based
            Glencore Plc (GLEN) is regulated by the FCA as is the Galena Asset
            Management Ltd. hedge fund arm of Amsterdam's Trafigura, and
            energy and metals trading firms related to Wichita, Kansas-based
            Koch Industries Inc, according to the FCA website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FCA in February issued its first report on commodity-market regulation in the U.K. since 2007.
            The study raised
            concerns about the increasing role in global markets played by
            commodity trading houses and the ability to adequately regulate
            them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Non-governmental organizations like Switzerland's Berne
            Declaration have said there is a gap in regulatory oversight in
            relation to traders like Mercuria, which recorded revenue of
            $112 billion in 2013. The firm and other traders have said their
            businesses are already subject to regulation through exchange-traded options trading and oversight of their
            banking partners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mercuria has always been subject to regulations and
            oversight across the globe in all of its activities and takes
            these responsibilities very seriously,' Attwood Scott said in
            the statement. 'As such, Mercuria views this development as an
            extension of its existing obligations and regulatory
            relationships as we broaden the scope of our business.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Says Emerging Stocks to Rally as Turkey Upgraded</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. upgraded
            equities in Turkey, Peru and South Africa, saying the Federal
            Reserve's decision to keep monetary stimulus intact would spur
            emerging-market stocks for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should add domestic cyclical stocks listed in
            Istanbul, Johannesburg and Mumbai, which underperformed their
            benchmarks since June, JPMorgan analysts including Adrian Mowat
            said in the e-mailed report dated Sept. 21. The New York-based
            investment bank downgraded Russian stocks on falling oil prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 2.2 percent the most
            in more than two months, on Sept. 19, the day after the Fed
            refrained from trimming its $85 billion monthly quantitative-easing program. Turkey, South Africa and India,
            which are facing
            among the biggest current-account deficits in developing
            countries, 'are the main beneficiaries' of the move, JPMorgan
            said. Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) and ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) are among its
            top-10 emerging stock picks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Fed is allowing investors to 'temporarily' relive the
            happy days of QE-driven EM bonds and equities,' JPMorgan said
            in the report. 'The switch to bullish EM equities was built on
            bearish positioning and improving cyclical data in EM.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank raised Turkey and Peru to overweight,
            joining Mexico, Thailand, the Philippines and Taiwan. South
            Africa was raised to neutral and Malaysia was cut to neutral.
            The MSCI gauge was little changed at 1:13 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Russia Downgrade &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower oil prices are a downside risk for Russia, JPMorgan
            said, lowering the country and Colombia to underweight, on par
            with Brazil. The Micex Index (INDEXCF) fell for a second day in Moscow,
            losing 0.6 percent to 1,468.08. Crude oil in New York has fallen
            3.1 percent this month, trimming the quarterly gain to 8.1
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Oil price is on thin ice given the receding threat of a
            military action by the U.S. and supply appears to be improving,
            particularly in Iraq and Libya,' JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S., France and the U.K. want a United Nations
            resolution this week that provides enforcement of the terms of
            the Sept. 14 Geneva accord between the U.S. and Russia to rid
            Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime of chemical weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equities in Thailand and the Philippines should advance,
            along with Indonesia, where the 'key risk' stems from an
            'overvalued' rupiah and declining foreign-exchange reserves,
            according to JPMorgan. The investment bank lowered Taiwanese and
            Korean financial-services stocks to neutral from overweight
            after higher interest rates helped them outperform. The Kopsi
            Finance Index has gained 5 percent this year in Seoul, compared
            with a 0.6 percent increase for the broader measure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also advised investors to 'stay away from policy-risk sectors that are value traps,'
            including Chinese financial
            companies, Brazilian banks, Indian materials and energy
            companies and utilities in various countries. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects second paragraph to show Canada, Germany and
            Children's Investment Fund Foundation are among those
            contributing the $94 million.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and the Bill
            Melinda Gates Foundation formed an investment fund that will
            back late-stage development of technologies to fight killer
            diseases in low-income countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A group of investors including the Canadian and German
            governments and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation
            committed $94 million to the fund. The International Finance
            Corp., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Merck Co. (MRK), Pfizer Inc. (PFE)'s
            foundation, Storebrand ASA (STB) and JPMorgan Chase also invested. The
            Global Health Investment Fund will tackle diseases including
            malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, as well as maternal and infant
            mortality, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The private financing seeks to address the fact that global
            health funding barely grew last year. The U.S. and other
            governments cut their aid to programs in developing nations by
            4.4 percent, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and
            Evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Global Health Investment Fund demonstrates the
            potential for innovative collaborations and thoughtful financial
            structures to mobilize new sources of capital for social
            challenges,' said Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive
            officer of JPMorgan Chase. 'This product brings a diverse group
            of investors together around the shared objective of developing
            life-saving technologies in a financially sustainable way.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given the risks of investing in the clinical development of
            new technologies, the Gates Foundation and the Swedish
            International Development Cooperation Agency will partially
            offset potential losses in the fund, which will seek a financial
            return for investors by targeting technologies with public
            health applications in both developed and emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lion's Head Global Partners LLP, a London-based asset
            manager specializing in sustainable development, will be
            responsible for originating, managing and exiting the fund's
            portfolio investments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Micex Index Falls Second Day as JPMorgan Cuts Russia on Crude</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russian stocks fell for a second
            day as JPMorgan Chase Co. reduced the nation's equities to the
            equivalent of sell on declining crude prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex (INDEXCF) slid 0.6 percent to 1,467.62 by the close in
            Moscow. OAO Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, dropped 1.3
            percent to 259.62 rubles. Steelmaker OAO Severstal sank 2.2
            percent to 293.20 rubles, while OAO Mechel (MTLR), Russia's biggest
            coking coal producer, retreated 3.4 percent to 107.50 rubles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut its weighting of Russian equities to
            underweight, citing a drop in the crude price as the risk of
            U.S. military action in Syria fades. Oil has averaged $105.90 a
            barrel in New York this quarter amid concern an attack may
            distrupt supplies, helping the benchmark index of the world's
            biggest energy exporter gain 11 percent since June. Crude lost 1
            percent to $103.61 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've seen the Micex gain a lot this quarter, we were
            expecting a slight correction, but valuations remain
            attractive,' Dmitri Kryukov, the chief investment officer at
            Verno Capital, said by phone from Moscow. 'Oil has been
            declining for the past few days.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Uralkali fell the most on the Micex, losing 4.7 percent
            to 170.15 rubles. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus
            counterpart Aleksandr Lukashenko 'briefly' discussed the
            potash producer today, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in
            Sochi, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Uralkali Retreats &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Uralkali's Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner
            was arrested in Minsk on Aug. 26, a month after he pulled out of
            a Belaruskali trading venture with Belarus. Baumgertner will
            probably be handed over to Russia soon, Kremlin foreign-policy
            aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters on Sept. 20. Uralkali sank 2.7
            percent to $27.25 in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Moscow Exchange fell 1 percent to 62.41 rubles. Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. removed the bourse from its central and eastern
            Europe, Middle East and Africa focus list, according to a note
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moscow Exchange shareholders will vote at a Nov. 14
            extraordinary meeting in Moscow on whether to approve the
            buyback of a 4.2 percent stake, the bourse said in a statement
            on Sept. 19 after the market close. The exchange plans to buy
            the shares at 55 rubles apiece, allowing stockowners as of Sept.
            25 to participate in the plan, it said. The company will buy the
            shares from its unit, OOO Micex Finance, after which it will

            &lt;p&gt;Polymetal International Plc (POLY), a Russian gold and silver
            miner, retreated 4.6 percent to 332 rubles, a second day of
            declines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Alrosa Surges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Alrosa, the world's biggest diamond miner by output,
            added 1.7 percent to 35.107 rubles, the biggest advancer. The
            company may sell a 14 percent stake in October, two people with
            direct knowledge of matter said on Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average trading volume on the Micex was about 11 percent
            below the 30-day average today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
            Ten-day price swings climbed to 16.184. The dollar-denominated
            RTS Index dropped 0.8 percent to 1,451.43. The gauge closed 19.9
            percent above this year's low on June 24, 0.9 index point short
            of a bull market, after the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly
            decided against reducing monetary stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even after last week's 2.5 percent rally, Russian equities
            have the cheapest valuations among 21 emerging economies tracked
            by Bloomberg. The Micex Index's 12-month estimated price-to-earnings ratio was at 4.3 today, compared with a
            multiple of
            10.7 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
            Russian stocks in New York fell 0.5 percent today, while the
            Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the largest dedicated Russian
            exchange-traded fund, dropped 0.6 percent. The ruble
            strengthened 0.1 percent to 36.8721 against the dollar-euro
            basket today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan-to Pay CFPB, Barclays, Fed `Hedging': Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank by assets, is paying $389 million in penalties and
            restitution to settle regulators' claims that it unfairly
            charged customers for credit-monitoring products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank will pay $60 million to the Office
            of the Comptroller of the Currency and $20 million to the
            Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in penalties for improperly
            billing customers for the 'add-on products,' the agencies said
            in a statement Sept. 20. JPMorgan has already paid $309 million
            in refunds to more than 2.1 million customers, CFPB Director
            Richard Cordray said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An investigation started by the OCC revealed that JPMorgan
            enrolled customers in credit-monitoring programs that were sold
            as add-ons to credit cards from October 2005 through June 2012,
            the consumer bureau said. The bank began charging customers for
            the programs before obtaining the necessary written
            authorization, the regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consumer bureau, created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010,
            is conducting an industrywide inquiry into various aspects of
            the add-on market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Wallace, the bank's head of operations for consumer
            and community banking, said in an e-mailed statement that the
            company's Chase Bank unit had stopped new enrollments in the
            products in mid-2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Any mistakes like these are regrettable and we are
            committed to ensuring our partners and vendors hold themselves
            to the same high standards that our customers expect of us,'
            Wallace said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank still faces a CFPB investigation, disclosed last
            month in a regulatory filing, over credit card debt sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Barclays Cybercrime Suspects Arrested Over $2.1 Million Theft &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;London police arrested eight men in connection to a 1.3
            million pound ($2.1 million) computer-aided robbery from a
            Barclays Plc (BARC) branch in the capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money was taken from the Swiss Cottage branch via the
            bank's computer system in April, the Metropolitan Police said in
            a statement Sept. 20. Barclays has recovered a 'significant
            amount' of the stolen funds, police said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The men, who are between 24 and 47, were arrested Sept. 19
            and 20 and are in custody in a London police station. Searches
            were carried out at addresses across London where cash, jewelry,
            drugs and credit cards have been found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Sept. 20 arrests marked the second time in a week that
            London police announced arrests over suspected bank hacking. The
            Met said on Sept. 13 it detained twelve men over an attempt to
            hack into Banco Santander SA (SAN) computers, preventing a theft
            potentially worth millions of pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks face cyber-security threats from increasingly
            sophisticated hackers trying to steal customer identities or
            access funds. In the Barclays case, police said a man posing as
            an information technology engineer had installed a device in the
            local branch that allowed the group to remotely transfer money
            to accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Barclays has no higher priority than the protection and
            security of our customers against the actions of would-be
            fraudsters,' Alex Grant, a managing director for fraud
            prevention at the bank, said in a statement. 'We can confirm
            that no customers suffered financial loss as a result of this
            action.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Co-Op Deal With Regulator Cited as Bailout Obstacle by Creditors &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parent of Co-operative Bank Plc, which is seeking
            capital after losses, may avoid being forced to rescue the
            lender thanks to an accord it struck with regulators last year,
            according to bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Co-Op Group Chief Executive Officer Euan Sutherland said in
            a letter to an unidentified bondholder, which was seen by
            Bloomberg News, that the Financial Services Authority agreed not
            to classify the firm as a 'mixed financial holding company.'
            That would mean Co-Op can't be forced to inject capital into the
            lender, Mark Taber, the organizer of a group of bondholders,
            said in a separate letter dated Sept. 19 to the Prudential
            Regulation Authority, or PRA, which along with the Bank of
            England replaced the FSA as the banking industry's regulators
            this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Co-Op Bank must raise 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) to
            plug a capital hole after losses incurred following its
            acquisition of Britannia Building Society in 2009. The FSA
            granted the waiver to the parent before the completion of a
            planned purchase to acquire 632 branches owned by Lloyds Banking
            Group Plc (LLOY) last year, Sutherland wrote in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Liam Parker, a spokesman for the PRA, declined to
            immediately comment on the contents of the page-long letter
            dated Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The FSA granted a three-year waiver from CGL being
            considered a mixed financial holding company and put the matter
            beyond doubt,' Sutherland wrote in the letter. 'That waiver
            remains in force.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Telfer to Pay $194,000 Costs in Settlement With Canada's OSC &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldcorp Inc. (G) Chairman Ian Telfer agreed to pay C$200,000
            ($194,000) in costs and will be banned from arranging for people
            to buy shares in companies he promotes for one year in a
            settlement over allegations that he violated Canadian securities
            laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Telfer admitted his conduct fell below standards expected
            from his position in capital markets, Cullen Price, a lawyer
            representing Ontario Securities Commission staff, said at a
            hearing Sept. 20 in Toronto. Telfer was reprimanded by the OSC
            as part of the settlement and will make the payment to cover the
            cost of the investigation, Price said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement is reasonable and appropriate, said Telfer's
            lawyer Kevin Richard. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sanctions don't include a prohibition on acting as a
            director and officer of a public company, which was among the
            potential penalties Telfer faced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Unitech Can Claim Deutsche Bank Libor Dishonesty, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unitech Ltd. (UT), an Indian property firm, won permission from
            a London judge to argue that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) dishonestly fixed
            interest rates in a U.K. trial over a derivative contract. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Unitech can't use rigging allegations to annul the
            disputed interest-rate swap, it can file a counter-claim for
            damages caused by the German lender's alleged attempts to
            influence the London interbank offered rate, Judge Nigel Teare
            said Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both the swap dispute and any claim linked to Libor must be
            decided at a trial, he said in a written ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. judges have taken differing approaches on lawsuits
            related to Libor-fixing allegations, which led to criminal and
            regulatory probes across the globe and fines totaling about $2.5
            billion for investment banks that tried to manipulate the
            interest-rate benchmark for profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unitech lost its first attempt in February to add Libor
            allegations to its U.K. lawsuit. Another judge allowed a suit to
            proceed against Barclays Plc for fraud related to the benchmark
            and swaps. Both decisions were appealed and will be decided in a
            joint appeal-court hearing scheduled for October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a long-standing case of a loan that was made and
            never paid back,' said Kathryn Hanes, a London spokeswoman for
            Deutsche Bank. Unitech's 'unfounded allegations about Libor are
            an attempt to delay payment and divert attention from its
            remaining unpaid debt on a swap agreement tied to the loan.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unitech's lawyer, Richard Gwynne, didn't immediately
            respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Swipe-Fee Rules to Remain in Place During Appeal, Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve's rules for debit-card transaction
            fees and processing will remain in place while the central bank
            appeals a decision throwing out the regulations, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both the Fed and retailers had asked the federal judge in
            Washington to keep the current rules in place pending the
            appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed is seeking to reverse Leon's ruling that it wrongly
            set the cap on debit-card transaction fees, known as swipe fees,
            at about 21 cents for each transaction, and neglected to bolster
            competition among payment networks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon's, unless
            overturned on appeal, will force regulators to revisit rules
            that bankers said would cost them 45 percent of their swipe-fee
            revenue. Lenders collected about $16 billion annually from those
            fees before the Fed's regulation and responded by cutting back
            on perks such as rewards programs and free checking to soften
            the blow to their profits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal
            Reserve System, 11-cv-02075, U.S. District Court, District of
            Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interviews &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Buffett Calls Federal Reserve History's Greatest Hedge Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire investor Warren Buffett compared the U.S.
            Federal Reserve to a hedge fund because of the central bank's
            ability to profit from bond purchases while accumulating a
            balance sheet of more than $3 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Fed is the greatest hedge fund in history,' Buffett
            told students Sept. 19 at Georgetown University in Washington.
            It's generating '$80 billion or $90 billion a year probably'
            in revenue for the U.S. government, he said. 'And that wasn't
            the case a few years back.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank has been buying $85 billion of bonds a
            month to help the U.S. recover as it emerges from the deepest
            slump since the Great Depression. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and
            other Fed policy makers unexpectedly opted last week to sustain
            that pace of asset purchases instead of tapering it, saying they
            need to see more signs of lasting improvement in the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed 'is under no pressure, none whatsoever to have to
            deleverage,' Buffett said. 'So it can pick its time, and if
            you have somebody wise there -- and I think Bernanke is wise,
            and I certainly expect his successor to be -- it can be handled.
            But it is something that's never quite been done on this scale.
            It will be interesting to watch.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Banks Facing Onslaught of Property Loan Seekers, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks face an influx of
            borrowers seeking commercial property loans in the wake of the
            Federal Reserve's decision to maintain the pace of its stimulus
            measures, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With interest rates falling since the central bank
            announcement, after a surge that started in May when Fed
            Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated policy makers could taper $85
            billion in monthly bond purchases as soon as September, issuance
            of commercial-mortgage bonds is poised to increase, according to
            JPMorgan analysts led by Ed Reardon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Both refinance volume and transaction volume will pick up
            as borrowers seek to lock in lower rates ahead of the eventual
            tapering decision,' the New York-based analysts said in a Sept.
            20 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extended period of low rates, a boon for property
            values, could strain investor appetite for securities linked to
            everything from skyscrapers to strip malls, according to
            JPMorgan. The bank is forecasting $77 billion in sales this
            year, with about $56.7 billion offered to date, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market for new commercial-mortgage backed securities
            reopened in 2010 after slamming shut when credit markets froze
            in 2008. The amount of debt paying down during the past five
            years outstripped the pace of new issuance, boosting demand,
            according to JPMorgan. That pattern is set to reverse as
            issuance rises. Sales are poised to double from last year's $42
            billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Net supply is now less of a tailwind for the market
            relative to the period when the CMBS market first reopened,'
            the JPMorgan analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Linda Bammann, a former JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) executive who joined the company's board last week,
            has almost $5 million of the bank's shares, according to a
            regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bammann, 57, owns 98,486 JPMorgan shares, according to a
            securities filing today. The stake is worth $4.96 million at
            today's closing price of $50.32 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, elected Bammann
            to the board effective Sept. 16. She was chief risk management
            officer at Bank One Corp. from 2001 until the lender, then run
            by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was sold to JPMorgan in
            2004. Bammann became deputy head of risk management at New York-based JPMorgan, where Dimon is now chairman
            and CEO, until her
            retirement in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bammann also has call options on 32,500 shares with strike
            prices between $47 and $50 per share, according to the filing.
            Options on an additional 15,000 shares with a strike price of
            $55 expired unexercised on Sept. 21, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s asset-management business hired Gareth Haslip to lead U.K. strategy
            for a group that advises insurance clients on investments and
            oversees more than $90 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Haslip previously was a director at Aon Benfield Securities

            companies on their investments will further strengthen our
            capabilities and deep working relationships with insurance
            companies in the U.K.,' Douglas Niemann, head of strategy and
            analytics for JPMorgan Asset Management's global insurance
            solutions team, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is adding staff as it vies with Goldman Sachs,
            BlackRock Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG for fee income from managing
            institutional client money. Insurance companies have outsourced
            oversight of some investment duties as they shift strategies
            amid new regulation and low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In June, JPMorgan said it hired Prashant Sharma from
            Goldman Sachs to head international fixed-income investments for
            insurance clients. Niemann joined the team in 2012 from insurer
            American International Group Inc. (AIG) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs announced the hiring of

            London-based Aon, declined to comment on the departure. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Hires Deutsche Bank's Bagriacik as Turkey Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest
            U.S. bank, hired Mustafa Bagriacik from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to head
            its business in Turkey and Azerbaijan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bagriacik, who has run the German lender's investment
            banking operations in Turkey since 2009, will start his new role
            as senior country officer for the two nations on Oct. 1, the New
            York-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. He will replace
            Emre Derman who left the bank earlier this year, according to a
            spokeswoman for JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment banking activity in the nation is recovering as
            mergers and acquisitions pick up after two elections wins by the
            ruling AK Party. Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604), Japan's largest
            brokerage, said in March it had received a license to open a
            representative office in Turkey. In March, Finance Minister
            Mehmet Simsek said that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was applying to
            the regulator to open a representative office in Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Bank of Greece SA has hired banks including
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to sell as much as 40 percent of
            Turkish unit Finansbank AS (FINBN) in a secondary share offering, four
            people familiar with the matter said Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bagriacik will oversee the bank's corporate, investment
            banking and asset management business in both countries in his
            new role, according to the statement. He will report to Sjoerd Leenart, senior country officer for the
            Middle East, Turkey and
            Africa. Prior to Deutsche Bank, Bagriacik worked at Goldman
            Sachs in London for 10 years, covering Turkish investment
            banking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bagriacik and Deutsche Bank declined to comment when
            contacted by phone. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Holder Said to Reject Earlier JPMorgan Chase Settlement Proposal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder
            told government negotiators working on a possible settlement
            with JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) that the company's initial proposal
            fell far short of an acceptable payment amount, according to a
            person with knowledge of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the early stages of the negotiations this week, the
            company was proposing a settlement of between $3 billion and $4
            billion, a separate person with knowledge of the negotiations
            said. Those numbers were rejected by the government, said the
            person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Subsequent proposals have reached higher dollar amounts,
            according to the person, who said that the numbers, as well as
            how the settlement money may be disbursed, are still subject to
            change. Both people requested anonymity to describe private
            negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to negotiate an accord resolving
            mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by federal and
            state authorities, according to one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adora Andy Jenkins, a Justice Department spokeswoman,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tesco Drops Most Since June After JPMorgan Cuts to Underweight</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tesco Plc (TSCO), the U.K.'s largest
            retailer, fell the most in more than three months as JPMorgan
            Cazenove cut the stock to underweight a week after being dropped
            as the supermarket company's co-brokerage adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares fell as much as 3 percent to 362.65 pence, the
            steepest intraday drop since June 20, as JPMorgan analysts said
            the emergence of German discounters Aldi and Lidl may cause
            Tesco to go 'through a painful rebasing of pricing and the
            gross margin, synonymous to a profit warning.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesco is struggling to maintain its dominant 30 percent
            market share as consumers defect to discounters, upscale chains
            such as Waitrose and the Internet. The grocer's market share
            fell to 30.2 percent in the 12 weeks ended Sept. 16 from 30.9
            percent a year earlier, Kantar Worldpanel said yesterday. Tesco
            is scheduled to report first-half earnings Oct. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aldi and Lidl are disrupting a price and range architecture
            that the U.K.'s four biggest supermarkets used for two decades,
            JPMorgan (JPM) analysts said in a report. That is 'of most concern to
            Tesco because its prices and ranges are margin driven.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesco dropped JPMorgan Cazenove and Nomura as brokerage
            advisers last week and said it appointed Barclays to work
            alongside Deutsche Bank in the role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura's new food retail analyst David Payne started his
            coverage of Tesco with a neutral recommendation last week. His
            predecessor Nick Coulter recommended buying the stock before
            leaving this year to join Tesco's investor relations team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesco traded at 363.3 pence as of 9:10 a.m. in London, down
            2.9 percent from yesterday's close. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Talks, BofA Race Bias, Libor Suit: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) resumed
            settlement talks with the U.S. as the government was preparing
            to sue the bank in California alleging it misrepresented the
            quality of mortgage-backed securities sold from 2005 to 2007,
            according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government informed JPMorgan it was ready to file a
            complaint yesterday in Sacramento, the person said. Shortly
            after, talks between the bank and Justice Department officials
            over a possible settlement restarted, said the person, who asked
            not to be identified because the matter isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wanted to negotiate an accord resolving mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by
            federal and state
            authorities, including probes by the U.S. attorneys in
            Sacramento, Philadelphia and Washington, according to another
            person briefed on the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also tried to settle a $6 billion claim by the
            Federal Housing Finance Agency and an investigation by New York
            Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who sued the company in
            October over mortgage bonds packaged by Bear Stearns Cos., which
            JPMorgan acquired in 2008, according to the person, who asked
            not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FHFA sued the bank and 17 other lenders two years ago
            over faulty mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on settlement negotiations. Adora Andy
            Jenkins, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Justice Department, and
            Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for FHFA, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BofA Told to Pay $2.2 Million in Race Bias Case Spanning Decades &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. was ordered to pay $2.2 million to
            black job applicants who were unfairly rejected for teller and
            clerical positions in a case spanning almost two decades,
            according to the U.S. Department of Labor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An administrative judge told the bank to pay $964,000 to
            more than 1,000 applicants from 1993 and $1.22 million to 113
            people who were rejected from 2002 to 2005, the regulator said
            yesterday in a statement. The lender also was ordered to make
            job offers to 10 people. The firm settled separate claims of
            racial and gender bias at its Merrill Lynch unit in the past
            month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Labor Department complaint stems from a routine review
            of hiring practices at an office in the firm's hometown of
            Charlotte, North Carolina, according to the statement. After
            talks broke down, the government filed an administrative
            complaint in 1997, asserting the federally insured bank was
            subject to laws covering U.S. contractors, the agency said. The
            firm challenged that authority, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets,
            said it's examining the recommended decision and order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Diversity and inclusion are part of our culture and core
            company values,' said Christopher Feeney, a company spokesman.
            'We actively promote an environment where all employees have
            the opportunity to succeed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Chase Said to Be Sued Over Libor With 12 Other Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co., Barclays Plc (BARC), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)
            and 10 other international lenders were sued by a U.S. credit
            union regulator alleging they illegally manipulated benchmark
            Libor interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The National Credit Union Administration, an Alexandria,
            Virginia-based regulator, said it sued the banks Sept. 23 at a
            U.S. court in Kansas. The filing couldn't immediately be
            confirmed in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Their alleged manipulation 'resulted in a loss of income
            from investments and other assets held by five failed corporate
            credit unions: U.S. Central, WesCorp, Members United, Southwest
            and Constitution,' according to an NCUA statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks are accused of giving false information in
            response to a daily survey by the British Bankers' Association,
            which asks lenders how much it would cost to borrow money from
            each other for various intervals in 10 different currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libor, the London interbank offered rate, is a key metric
            to set interest rates for trillions of dollars in financial
            instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The misinformation allowed them to 'benefit their
            investments that were tied to Libor, to reduce their borrowing
            costs, to deceive the marketplace as to the true state of their
            creditworthiness, and to deprive investors of the interest rate
            payments to which they were entitled,' according to the NCUA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kerrie Ann Cohen, a New York-based spokeswoman for
            Barclays, declined to comment on the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            and Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, also declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is National Credit Union Administration Board v.
            Credit Suisse Group AG, U.S. District Court, District of Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-SAC Manager Martoma Has Assets Frozen in Insider Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A judge in Manhattan yesterday froze the Florida home and
            other assets of former SAC Capital Advisors LP manager Mathew
            Martoma, who is charged in a $276 million insider trading case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. claims the assets, including Martoma's $1.9
            million Boca Raton home and more than $4 million in accounts
            held by Martoma and his wife, were derived from the alleged
            crime. The government is seeking forfeiture if Martoma is
            convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors and lawyers representing Martoma agreed to the
            order, which bars him from transferring the property while the
            case against him goes forward. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. claims Martoma used inside information from two
            doctors who were involved in the clinical trial of the
            Alzheimer's disease drug bapineuzumab, or 'bapi,' to trade in
            shares of Elan Corp. (ELN) and Wyeth on behalf of SAC, the hedge fund
            company founded by Steven A. Cohen. The government has called it
            the biggest criminal insider-trading case against an individual
            in history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martoma was paid a $9.3 million bonus tied to the illegal
            trades, prosecutors claim. SAC, based in Stamford, Connecticut,
            was indicted in July, partly because of Martoma's alleged
            illegal trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martoma has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to
            begin Nov. 4. It may be delayed at his lawyer's request and to
            accommodate court schedules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martoma, 12-cr-00973, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Wins Case Over Interest Deductions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. is entitled to deduct
            interest on a loan linked to a transaction with a British bank
            that generated disallowed tax credits, a U.S. Tax Court judge
            ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The loan 'served a purpose beyond the creation of the tax
            benefits,' Judge Diane Kroupa wrote in an opinion released
            Sept. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kroupa's decision grew out of her ruling earlier this year
            that BNY Mellon couldn't claim $199 million of tax credits and
            related expense deductions for 2001 and 2002 from a series of
            transactions with London-based Barclays Plc (BCS) because they had no
            economic substance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon didn't challenge Kroupa's ruling on the tax
            credits and instead argued that since she ruled that the loan
            proceeds could be used by the bank for business purposes,
            interest on them is deductible. Kroupa agreed with that
            analysis. The ruling didn't indicate the amount of interest at
            stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a spokesman for BNY Mellon, declined to
            comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon Corp. v. IRS, 09-26683,
            U.S. Tax Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;SEC's White Says Jury 'Still Out' on High-Speed Trading &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo
            White talked about market regulations, banking rules and high-frequency trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging discussion, White talked about
            acknowledgments of wrongdoing in SEC settlements, as well as
            rule-making topics such as crowd-funding, which she described as
            a 'very high priority,' adding that she hopes to get those
            rules done this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;White also vowed the agency would eventually adopt a June 5
            proposal to add new restrictions to money-market mutual funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She spoke with Peter Cook at the Bloomberg Link Markets 50
            Summit in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Bank Agency Invites Foreign Regulators to Review Its Work &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulator of U.S. national banks is inviting overseas
            counterparts to find flaws in its practices that may have caused
            the agency to miss early signs of the coming financial crisis
            more than five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said he has asked
            regulators from Australia, Singapore and Canada to review his
            agency's bank supervision methods even as the OCC conducts its
            own performance evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Curry made the comments in remarks prepared for delivery at
            an American Banker regulatory conference this week in Arlington,
            Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OCC was among regulators criticized by lawmakers for
            missing early evidence that the financial system was under
            threat before the crisis, as well as for overlooking initial
            signs of money-laundering violations at HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and
            trades at JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We'll be looking at everything from agency culture to our
            approach to risk identification,' Curry said in his remarks,
            'and we'll be looking for gaps in the system that might have
            led us to miss problems in the past.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia, Singapore and Canada were selected as countries
            that weathered the 2008 global credit crisis well, Curry said.
            They will conduct 'an independent peer review of the process we
            use for the supervision of large banks and thrifts' -- an
            evaluation he said could be 'frankly painful' for those at the
            OCC, Curry said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Among Banks Mining Demand for Polish Coal Bonds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Poland's top three coal companies,
            burdened by losses amid communist-era benefit payments and a
            market glut, are hiring banks including JPMorgan Chase Co. and
            BNP Paribas SA to sell debut Eurobonds to raise cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas were picked by Katowicki
            Holding Weglowy SA, the third-biggest coal-miner, to manage a
            euro-denominated debt sale, two people familiar with the plan
            said on Sept. 18, asking not to be identified because the
            details are private. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG
            were also hired by the miners, separate people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unprecedented rush for international financing is
            occurring as mining unions prepare protests against plans by the
            state-controlled companies to restructure operations and clamp
            down on benefits. Kompania Weglowa SA, the European Union's
            largest producer, said this week it will scrap free coal
            allowances for 160,000 retired employees, which cost it about
            260 million zloty ($79.1 million) annually. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Foreign issues are the only way for these companies to
            gain funds,' Mariusz Zarod, a money manager at BZ WBK Asset
            Management in Poznan, Poland, with the equivalent of $3.7
            billion under management, said by e-mail yesterday. 'If they
            manage to pull it off, they will probably sell high-yield notes,
            even though some investors won't go near them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Falling Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kompania, which had a 675.7 million-zloty net loss last
            year, chose Barclays, BNP and Deutsche Bank for its offering,
            according to separate people familiar with the plan. The company
            aims to meet three rating companies by early October, spokesman
            Tomasz Zieba said last week, declining to comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The third miner, Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA, hired
            JPMorgan and Credit Suisse for a sale of at least $500 million
            in notes in the fourth quarter, a person familiar with the
            details said last month. Spokeswoman Katarzyna Jablonska-Bajer
            declined to comment by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices of European coal for delivery next year fell to
            $75.2 a ton at 2:23 p.m. in Warsaw today, the lowest level since
            March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Waning demand is
            also compounded by 'overstaffing, mismanagement and numerous
            unions,' Zarod said. Scrapping the free coal benefits will help
            Kompania avoid bankruptcy and pave the way for long-term
            financing, the company said in the Sept. 23 e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miners ran up a combined 772.3 million-zloty net loss in
            the first half, compared with profit of 15.6 million zloty a
            year earlier, the Economy Ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Industry Headwinds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Katowicki Holding will seek to raise 500 million euros
            ($636 million) of bonds in November to refinance existing debt
            and boost working capital, Chief Financial Officer Artur Trzeciakowski told PAP newswire on Sept. 18. The
            company earlier
            held talks with 'most banks' in Poland and failed to convince
            them to increase their funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Polish debt offerings come as some eastern European
            miners face headwinds. Russia's economy minister said last week
            he saw no alternative to bankruptcy for OAO Mechel, the
            country's biggest producer of coking coal, following nine months
            of unsuccessful efforts to refinance its debt. New World
            Resources Plc, a Czech miner, is restructuring 775 million euros
            of bonds after falling coal prices hit it with seven consecutive
            quarterly losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Polish government debt has attracted investors seeking less
            risky regional assets amid the fallout from the Ukraine crisis.
            The yield on the 2019 euro-denominated sovereign bond declined
            to a record low of 0.61 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It should be possible for Polish miners to place
            Eurobonds (BEMC) as long as they are state-controlled,' Clemens Hansmann, a money manager at Gutmann
            Kapitalanlage AG in Vienna,
            which oversees 7 billion euros of assets, said by e-mail
            yesterday. 'There is a structural decline in global demand for
            thermal coal. For the Polish coal mines, this pressure will
            continue' and 'investors are well aware of these structural
            issues,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) hired Mark Alberici, who left Bank of America Corp. last month, as head of
            equity derivatives structuring in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alberici, who works on structured notes that the bank
            creates for sale to retail investors, started at JPMorgan this
            month, said Justin Perras, a company spokesman. He reports to
            Jason Sippel, managing director of equity derivatives in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alberici declined to comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He worked at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner Smith Inc.
            since July 2000, according to online records of the Financial
            Industry Regulatory Authority. Bank of America bought Merrill
            Lynch in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move was originally reported by
            Structuredretailproducts.com, an industry newsletter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets while earning fees and
            raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived
            from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or events such
            as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan at Chrysler Side After Being Burned in Bankruptcy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the lender
            that lost almost $2 billion during Chrysler Group LLC's 2009
            bankruptcy, is now its chief adviser as the automaker's two
            owners haggle over its value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will advise Chrysler in the event of its sale to
            majority shareholder, Fiat SpA, said people with knowledge of
            the matter who asked not to be identified because the
            information is private. The bank was also listed this week as
            the lead underwriter of an initial public offering of Chrysler
            shares owned by the company's other shareholder, a United Auto
            Workers retiree trust. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dual role highlights the complicated path Chrysler has
            been forced to take to resolve a dispute between its two
            backers. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive officer of both
            Chrysler and Fiat who has spent four years seeking to merge the
            companies, is at loggerheads with the UAW's trust over the value
            of its 41.5 percent stake in Chrysler. Letting public investors
            put a price on the stake, through the IPO process, is one way to
            resolve the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'From a banker's viewpoint, more transactions are
            preferred to less,' said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at
            the University of Florida. 'In either an IPO or a merger, the
            acquisition of the remaining stake offers opportunities to
            collect fees.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Inflation Expectations Drop to Lowest Since 2010, JPMorgan Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investor expectations for U.S.
            inflation have declined to the lowest in more than three years
            even as data point to economic recovery, JPMorgan Chase Co.,
            said, citing surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While policy makers in major economies are providing
            unprecedented stimulus, investors see little price pressure in
            the U.S., the euro region or the U.K. over the next five years,
            according to the bank's quarterly overview published yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors expect U.S. inflation to average 1.68 percent in
            the next 12 months, compared with 1.85 percent in the previous
            survey in March. Over the next two-to-five years, the rate is
            seen at 2.4 percent, the lowest since the July 2010 survey,
            JPMorgan said. The report was based on responses from 320
            investors including asset-management companies, pension funds,
            banks and hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Medium-term inflation expectations for the euro region
            dropped to the least since the surveys began in March 2010, with
            investors predicting consumer prices will increase at a 1.3
            percent rate in the next 12 months and 2 percent in the two-to-five-year horizon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan to HSBC Stall EU Euribor Case Amid Bias Probe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), HSBC Holdings
            Plc (HSBA) and Credit Agricole SA (ACA) delayed by months the European
            Union's investigation into Euribor rigging amid scrutiny of
            possible EU bias, according to three people familiar with the
            case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trio gained more time to respond to the EU's May
            antitrust complaint after demanding to see files necessary for
            their defense, said the people who asked not to be named because
            the issue is private. These requests have been taken more
            seriously since the EU's ombudsman started inquiring into Credit
            Agricole's bias allegations, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The European Commission doesn't want to appear to have
            been too tough on Credit Agricole,' Adrien Giraud, a lawyer at
            Willkie Farr Gallagher LLP, said. 'That might explain why
            they were more lenient on deadlines than usually.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Euribor-rigging investigation has been strained since
            the three refused to join four other lenders including Deutsche
            Bank AG (DBK) and Societe Generale SA (GLE) who paid a total of 1 billion
            euros ($1.3 billion) to settle the case. The delays -- including
            the latest scrapping of a mid-September deadline for responses -
            - robbed Joaquin Almunia, the EU's antitrust chief, of the
            chance to impose another set of fines on the finance industry as
            he prepares to leave office at the end of next month, the people
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives for the commission, JPMorgan, HSBC and
            Credit Agricole all declined to comment on the Euribor
            investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Failed Settlement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia said this month that time has run out in his two-year long quest to clinch an antitrust
            settlement with Google
            Inc. (GOOG) He's also conceded that he won't have time to complete an
            antitrust probe into credit derivatives trading by 13 of the
            world's biggest banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's clear that Almunia has accepted that he won't be
            able to finalize several cases' and Euribor 'is just one more
            on his list,' Giraud said. 'The officials working on the case
            aren't therefore in as much of a hurry.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU ombudsman, the internal EU watchdog, opened a case
            on July 31 after Credit Agricole complained that public comments
            made by Almunia indicated he had already made up his mind about
            the conclusion of the Euribor investigation, Bloomberg News
            reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia's stance explains the banks' determination to try
            to delay the case until after his departure, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Fairness and Transparency' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His successor, former Danish Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager, is scheduled to take over the EU
            antitrust brief and
            deal with the EU ombudsman's inquiry at the start of November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vestager said this month that all cases should be 'treated
            with fairness and transparency.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aside from examining Euribor, Vestager will inherit a
            preliminary probe into suspected rigging of foreign-exchange
            markets, which is part of a global scandal that tarnished the
            reputation of some of the world's biggest lenders. Oil
            benchmarks are also under scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole were accused on May 20
            by the commission of colluding to rig Euribor rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The so-called statement of objections was the next step in
            the EU enforcement process after the banks dropped out of
            settlement talks last year. The EU procedure allows them to
            respond to the complaint in writing and request a hearing. If
            companies fail to deflect accusations in antitrust cases they
            are then usually fined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, and Libor, the
            London Interbank Offered Rate, gauge banks' estimated cost of
            borrowing over different periods of time. Libor alone is the
            benchmark interest rate for more than $300 trillion of
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Banks Prejudged &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole haven't yet been
            found liable, the December settlements spell out their role in
            helping to manipulate Euribor, said another person familiar with
            the confidential EU documents. This suggested the EU had
            prejudged the three banks before they were given their full due-process rights, said the person who is
            familiar with the
            reasoning of a settling bank and raised the issue with the
            commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission shouldn't make 'any allusion to the
            liability' of companies in a final decision -- such as the
            December Euribor settlements -- before the firms are given a
            chance to fend off charges, according to EU case law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The companies could argue their case has been decided
            before they had the chance to defend themselves,' said Alfonso
            Lamadrid, a lawyer at Garrigues in Brussels who's not involved
            in the case. This would give them 'new procedural ammunition to
            challenge an eventual sanction' in court. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan, Citigroup Lose Bid to Throw Out FDIC Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup
            Inc. (C) were among the banks that lost a bid to throw out a Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corp. lawsuit over $388 million in securities
            sold to a failed lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan today denied
            a motion to dismiss the suit, which also targets UBS AG (UBSN),
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Wells Fargo Co. (WFC) Stanton rejected defense
            arguments that FDIC filed the suit too late and that the agency
            failed to make a sufficient claim that could allow it to
            recover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the suit, filed last year, FDIC alleged that the banks
            misrepresented the quality of the loans underlying 11
            residential mortgage-backed securities that Colonial Bank
            purchased in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colonial Bank, of Montgomery, Alabama, was closed by the
            Alabama State Banking Department on Aug. 14, 2009, and the FDIC
            was named as a receiver for the institution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The misrepresentations included inaccurate loan-to-value
            ratios based on inflated property values, according to the
            complaint. Many of the properties at issue also had second
            mortgages that weren't disclosed, the FDIC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In many cases, the amount of the undisclosed additional
            liens was much greater than the owners' ostensible equity,
            putting the owner 'under water' on the day on which this
            securitization closed,' the FDIC said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for
            Colonial Bank v. Chase Mortgage Finance Corp, 12-cv-6166, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>GE Capital Caps Rebound in Swaps on Less Risk Than JPMorgan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;For the first time since the 2008
            financial crisis, derivatives traders regard General Electric
            Capital Corp. (GE) as less risky than JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) as GE
            shrinks the unit and the bank faces billions of dollars in
            fines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps protecting debt of GE Capital cost 2.5
            basis points less than debt of JPMorgan, according to data
            provider CMA. Contracts on the biggest U.S. bank by assets
            traded 26.5 basis points lower at the start of 2013 and as much
            as 497 basis points lower in April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The price reversal marks a milestone in GE's recovery from
            damage suffered when the finance unit imperiled the Fairfield,
            Connecticut-based company as its access to capital dwindled in
            2008-09. While JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            negotiates a potential $11 billion settlement to end a U.S.
            regulatory probe, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt is seeking to curb risk
            by plotting exits from some real estate and lending operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'GE Capital is performing relatively well versus JPMorgan,
            and the other banks as well, as they've shed their higher-risk
            assets,' Brian Monteleone, a Barclays Plc credit analyst in New
            York, said in a telephone interview. 'JPMorgan has been
            underperforming for the last couple months and that's been
            largely drive by the various negative regulatory and litigation-related headlines.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Joins Nomura Selling Notes Linked to Peripheral Banks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of structured notes tied to
            the creditworthiness of banks in the euro region's periphery are
            the highest in six months as investors gain confidence lenders
            will benefit from the region's improving economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) led issuance
            of $42.3 million of the securities in September, the most since
            $167.2 million in March, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The notes are tied to the debt of lenders including
            Spain's Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP), Banco BPI SA of Portugal and
            UniCredit SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro area's economy emerged from its longest-ever
            recession in the second quarter and European Central Bank
            President Mario Draghi said this week he's ready to use another
            longer-term refinancing operation if needed to curb market
            rates. Bank credit risk is improving, with investors demanding
            102 basis points of extra yield to hold their debt instead of
            government bonds, down from 179 a year earlier, according to
            Bloomberg bond index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Peripheral banks have been beaten up over the past few
            years, but there is growing investor comfort with them and more
            willingness to take on that exposure, especially in Spain where
            the restructuring of balance sheets has been extensive and
            visible,' said Steve Hussey, head of financial institutions
            credit research at AllianceBernstein Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Spanish Lenders &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spanish banks took more than 200 billion euros ($270.6
            billion) of impairments between June 2008 and December 2012 amid
            the collapse of a decade-long property boom that sent home
            prices plunging and burdened banks with more bad loans,
            according to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. The country's
            lenders, which have received 129 billion euros of capital
            injections since the end of 2007, are in a strong position to
            pass an ECB asset quality review next year, BBVA's chief
            financial officer Manuel Gonzalez Cid, said Sept. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan issued the first credit-linked notes tied to
            Portugal's Banco BPI since at least 1999, Bloomberg data show.
            The largest U.S. bank by assets raised $19.8 million from two
            offerings that pay 4.7 percentage points and 4.8 percentage
            points more than the three-month euro interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura sold $5.5 million of 15-year callable notes tied to
            UniCredit, Italy's largest bank, with coupons of 9.1 percent
            this month, as well as 2.28 million euros of 5.26 percent
            securities linked to Banco Popolare SC. Italian banks' gross
            non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending rose to
            7.2 percent in July from 5.7 percent a year earlier, according
            to the Italian Banking Association ABI. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Craig MacDonald, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
            declined to comment on the notes, while Nomura spokesman Rob
            Davies was unable to comment immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Interest in peripheral banks is emblematic of the risk-on
            environment, with investors looking to take advantage of wider
            credit spreads on offer in countries like Spain and Italy' said
            Michael Symonds, a credit analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets in
            London. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Talks, Bid Rigging, Danish Mortgages: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co.'s (JPM) negotiations
            with federal and state authorities to resolve a series of
            investigations tied to mortgage bonds are focusing on a
            potential $11 billion figure, including $4 billion for consumer
            relief, a person familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount isn't final, said the person, who asked not to
            be identified because the negotiations aren't public. Those
            involved in the talks include the U.S. Justice Department, the
            Department of Housing and Urban Development and New York
            Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is co-chairman of a
            federal and state working group on residential mortgage-backed
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon arrived at the
            Justice Department in Washington yesterday to personally discuss
            the settlement with Attorney General Eric Holder, according to a
            person familiar with the meeting. Federal officials rejected a
            proposal'from the bank earlier this week to pay between $3
            billion and $4 billion to settle the probes, a separate person
            with knowledge of the negotiations said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The talks are still fluid and the size of the settlement
            keeps changing, according to another person familiar with the
            matter. The people said they weren't sure which claims may be
            resolved. The bank is trying to resolve as many probes as
            possible before the end of the third quarter on Sept. 30,
            according to people familiar with the bank's thinking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking to negotiate a resolution to mortgage-bond investigations being conducted by
            federal and state
            authorities, including probes by U.S. attorneys in Philadelphia,
            Washington and Sacramento, California, according to another
            person briefed on the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has also tried to settle a $6 billion claim by the
            Federal Housing Finance Agency, according to the person, who
            also asked not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
            declined to comment on the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Talks are ongoing,' Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman for
            Sacramento U.S. Attorney Ben Wagner, one of the federal
            officials involved in the talks, said Sept. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, JPMorgan agreed to pay $920 million in penalties
            over $6.2 billion in losses stemming from derivatives trading by
            the bank's chief investment office in London. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Germany Rejects Plan for $68 Billion Fund to Aid Non-Euro Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Germany rejected a European Commission proposal to turn a
            50 billion-euro ($68 billion) rescue fund into a bank backstop
            for member states outside the single-currency bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Union's balance-of-payments fund currently has
            about 40 billion euros available, after being used to help
            Latvia, Hungary and Romania. The commission, the EU's executive
            arm, now wants to overhaul the fund and add a tool for bank aid
            that could be tapped by non-euro countries whose lenders fail
            next year's continent-wide stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The German government and those of five other EU member
            states, including non-euro countries, reject the plan, which
            isn't needed to maintain financial stability, a German Finance
            Ministry official said by telephone yesterday on customary
            condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Brussels-based commission wants a resource that can
            operate alongside the euro area's 500 billion-euro firewall, the
            European Stability Mechanism, so that the entire 28-nation EU is
            braced for the results of next year's stress tests. The goal is
            to reach a deal by the end of this year so that the tool can be
            ready by mid-2014, when the commission also hopes to have
            finished negotiations on when the firewall can provide direct
            aid to euro-zone banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will be conducting balance-sheet
            reviews of major banks across the euro area as it prepares to
            take on new oversight duties in the second half of 2014. If all
            the proposed backstops are in place, the EU would have as much
            as 400 billion euros available to handle any banking problems
            that emerge. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;China May Allow Non-Financials to Set Up Consumer Finance Units &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The China Banking Regulatory Commission plans to allow non-financial companies to set up consumer
            finance companies, the
            regulator said in a statement on its website yesterday, citing
            revised draft rules and seeking public opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Non-financial companies will require experienced strategic
            investors to meet regulatory requirements, according to the
            statement. The minimum stake requirement for major shareholders
            will be lowered to 30 percent from the current 50 percent, the
            commission said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer finance companies will be allowed to accept
            deposits from their shareholders in China, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Danish Regulator Cracks Down on Mortgage Banks as Risks Grow &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denmark's financial regulator is preparing a set of
            guidelines due to be unveiled next year to stop mortgage banks
            falling deeper into a funding mismatch spawned by reliance on
            short-term borrowing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Financial Supervisory Authority, criticized in a
            government-commissioned report last week for failing to curb
            risk-taking in the years leading into the financial crisis,
            plans to set limits on issuance of bonds backing interest-only
            and adjustable-rate mortgages in the $500 billion market,
            Director General Ulrik Noedgaard said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A government-appointed committee investigating the causes
            behind Denmark's housing and banking crises said last week
            regulators should have done more to prevent an explosion in
            lending. More than one-third of the country's commercial banks
            have closed since a property bubble burst in 2008, according to
            the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FSA's standards will be based on recommendations from
            the crisis committee, Noedgaard said. The clampdown on lending
            follows warnings from Moody's Investors Service, Standard
            Poor's and the central bank that a shift away from 30-year,
            fixed-rate mortgages during the past decade is threatening
            Denmark's financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mizuho Penalized for Transactions With 'Anti-Social' Groups &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)'s lending unit was penalized by
            Japan's banking regulator for failing to take steps to end more
            than two years of transactions with 'anti-social' groups. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho Bank Ltd. was ordered to strengthen legal compliance
            and administrative controls, the Financial Services Agency said
            in a statement in Tokyo today. The unit of Japan's third-biggest
            bank by market value made loans to the anti-social groups, the
            FSA said, without identifying them. The phrase is often used in
            Japan to describe criminal organizations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese authorities have stepped up efforts to combat
            yakuza gangs, whose activities range from extortion to fraud and
            money laundering, according to the National Police Agency. In
            the first penalty of its kind against a Japanese bank since
            2007, the FSA told Mizuho to make a 'clean break' from the
            groups after conducting 230 transactions, mostly car loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho made transactions valued at about 200 million yen
            ($2 million), an FSA official said at a news briefing in Tokyo,
            asking not to be named in accordance with the agency's policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has to formulate measures to prevent a recurrence
            and submit a business improvement plan by Oct. 28, the regulator
            said. It will report on its progress at the end of November and
            December and then every three months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho 'takes this order very seriously and deeply regrets
            these occurrences,' the bank said in a statement. The Tokyo-based company hasn't decided any internal
            penalties yet,
            spokeswoman Masako Shiono said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's action is the latest blow to Mizuho after the FSA
            punished the bank for a computer glitch that delayed
            transactions following the nation's March 2011 earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rabobank Said to Be Close to Libor Probe Settlement Next Month &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rabobank Groep may reach a settlement with regulators as
            soon as next month over claims the Dutch bank tried to
            manipulate benchmark interest rates, a person with knowledge of
            the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rabobank, the Netherlands' biggest mortgage lender, is
            likely to pay a fine higher than the 290 million pounds ($466
            million) levied on Barclays Plc (BARC) in June 2012 and lower than the
            $612 million paid by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, though it
            may be negotiated even below the Barclays fine, said the person,
            who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rabobank, the only Dutch contributor to the London
            interbank offered rate, has had talks since at least 2011 with
            regulators including the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
            Commission, the Justice Department and the U.K. Financial
            Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Europe's biggest agricultural lender is next in line to
            settle probes into Libor. The settlement's timing was reported
            earlier by the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hendrik Jan Eijpe, a spokesman for the Utrecht-based
            lender, said the company is cooperating with the investigations
            and declined to comment on the status of the probes. Rabobank in
            August said it took a provision to settle probes into Libor,
            without elaborating the size of the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender previously said it received Libor-and Euribor-related subpoenas and information requests
            in nations including
            the Netherlands, U.K., U.S. and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's Capital Rules Compliant With Basel III, Basel Group Says &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'China's implementation of the Basel capital framework was
            found to be closely aligned with the Basel III global
            standards,' the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Some differences with the Basel framework were found,'
            the Basel group said in statement on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'None of the findings were judged to be material at this
            point,' the group said. China's 'response to the report
            expresses the strong commitment of the Chinese authorities to
            implement the global regulatory reforms,' the Basel group said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;GM Suppliers in Japan Plead Guilty in $5 Billion Cartel Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503), Hitachi Automotive Systems Ltd. (6501)
            and seven other Japanese companies agreed to plead guilty and
            pay a total of $740 million in fines for a price-fixing
            conspiracy targeting automakers that included General Motors Co. (GM)
            and Ford Motor Co. (F) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chrysler Group LLC and Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) were also among
            car companies operating in the U.S. that faced inflated costs on
            more than $5 billion of parts, affecting prices on at least 25
            million vehicles, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a
            news conference yesterday in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The announcement brings criminal fines in the Justice
            Department's continuing probe of price fixing in the auto-parts
            industry to more than $1.6 billion and the number of companies
            and individuals charged to 20 and 21 respectively, the Justice
            Department said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seventeen of the 21 executives have been sentenced to jail
            in the U.S. or have entered into plea agreements calling for
            'significant' prison sentences, Holder said. Two of them were
            charged yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scott Hammond, a deputy assistant attorney general who
            worked on the investigation said there are 'more than a dozen
            separate conspiracies operating independently,' that all target
            U.S. automotive manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plea agreements must be accepted by a federal judge to
            become final. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-RBS Trader Fired Over Libor-Rigging Sues for Unfair Dismissal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A former Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc trader sued the
            lender over his firing for alleged misconduct related to
            manipulation of benchmark interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Simon Green, who traded derivatives tied to short-term
            moves in interest rates in dollars and euros, filed an unfair
            dismissal suit, according to documents from a London employment
            tribunal. He was let go in March, weeks after the Edinburgh-based bank paid $612 million to settle with
            regulators probing
            its attempts to rig the London interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Claims that traders tried to influence Libor, the benchmark
            for $300 trillion of contracts worldwide, led to criminal probes
            and regulatory fines for Barclays Plc, UBS AG (UBSN), RBS and broker
            ICAP Plc. (IAP) RBS has fired seven employees for misconduct related
            to Libor, a person familiar with the matter said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sarah Small, an RBS spokeswoman, declined to comment. The
            bank has said it will claw back bonuses from those involved to
            help pay any fines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Green's lawyer, Layla Bunni, said she couldn't immediately
            comment when reached by phone at her office in London. Copies of
            the employment complaint aren't publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Green may argue he was singled out unfairly, or that the
            bank knew about his actions and did nothing until regulators
            intervened, according to employment lawyer Jo Keddie, who isn't
            involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-ChinaCast Chairman Sued by SEC Over Claims He Stole Millions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the
            former chairman and chief executive officer of ChinaCast
            Education Corp. (CAST) of stealing tens of millions of dollars from
            investors in a U.S. public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chan Tze Ngon, 57, transferred $41 million out of the $43.8
            million raised from investors to a purported subsidiary in which
            he secretly held a controlling 50 percent stake, the SEC said in
            a statement. Chan also secretly pledged $30.4 million of
            ChinaCast's cash deposits to secure the debts of entities
            unrelated to the company, according to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC also sued Jiang Xiangyuan, ChinaCast's former
            president for operations in China, over claims he avoided more
            than $200,000 in losses by illegally selling shares in the
            company on confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ChinaCast entered U.S. capital markets in 2006 through a
            reverse merger, in which a closely held firm buys a shell
            company already on an exchange in order to list shares without a
            public offering, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong-based company had a market capitalization of
            more than $200 million before the alleged frauds came to light,
            the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chan and Jiang, who live in China, have no known defense
            counsel, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interviews/Conferences &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dimon Going to Justice a 'Brilliant Move,' Farley Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Richard Farley, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings LLP,
            talked about JPMorgan Chase Co.'s negotiations with federal
            and state authorities to resolve a series of investigations tied
            to mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon arrived at the
            Justice Department in Washington yesterday morning reportedly to
            discuss a settlement with Attorney General Eric Holder. Farley
            spoke with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg
            Television's 'Market Makers.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Bankers gathered in Frankfurt at the European Supervisor
            Education Initiative's conference yesterday. Speakers included
            European Central Bank Governing Council member Yves Mersch,
            European Banking Authority Chairman Andrea Enria, ECB Vice
            President Vitor Constancio and U.S. Federal Reserve Governor
            Jeremy Stein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the topics covered were setting up the single
            supervisory mechanism and the European economic outlook. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;SEC's White Says Investigators Will Focus Cases on Individuals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo
            White said her agency will focus on bringing more cases against
            individuals who violate securities laws rather than the
            companies where they work. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I want to be sure we are looking first at the individual
            conduct and working out to the entity, rather than starting with
            the entity as a whole and working in,' White said in remarks
            prepared for delivery at a Council of Institutional Investors
            conference in Chicago yesterday. 'It is a subtle shift, but one
            that could bring more individuals into enforcement cases.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SEC investigators will also seek more mandatory compliance
            measures in settlements to prevent future misconduct and not
            just punish past wrongdoing, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Redress for wrongdoing must never be seen as a cost of
            doing business made good by cutting a corporate check,' White
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Citigroup Follows JPMorgan as Legal Target, Peabody Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) is poised to be the
            next U.S. bank to attract legal and regulatory scrutiny as
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) looks to settle a host of probes, according
            to an analyst at Portales Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup's $5 billion estimate of potential legal costs
            that weren't covered by reserves at midyear is second only to
            JPMorgan, Charles Peabody of Portales said yesterday in a
            Bloomberg Radio interview. That shows Citigroup may be bracing
            for more legal challenges, Peabody said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's very conceivable that Citigroup will be next in the
            firing line,' Peabody said. 'Their litigation costs have been
            accelerating faster than anyone else's.' Citigroup is the
            third-largest U.S. bank by assets and JPMorgan is ranked first.
            Both are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this month
            that announcements about banks other than JPMorgan would be made
            in the coming weeks and months. Citigroup Chief Executive
            Officer Michael Corbat has seen litigation costs climb to $1.44
            billion in the first half of 2013, putting this year on track to
            be the most expensive for such costs since the financial crisis,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mark Costiglio, a company spokesman, declined to comment.
            The lender is facing 'legacy issues' tied to mortgage
            products, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said in July. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. At 77 He Flips Burgers Earning Former Hourly Wage in Week &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- It seems like another life. At the
            height of his corporate career, Tom Palome was pulling in a
            salary in the low six-figures and flying first class on business
            trips to Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. JPMorgan Said to See $11 Billion Accord as Dimon Joins Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase Co.'s negotiations
            with federal and state authorities to resolve a series of
            investigations tied to mortgage bonds are focusing on a
            potential $11 billion figure, including $4 billion for consumer
            relief, a person familiar with the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. SAC Said to Seek Settlement of U.S. Insider-Trading Cases &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for hedge fund SAC Capital
            Advisors LP reached out to prosecutors in New York last week to
            say that founder Steven Cohen is interested in settling the
            civil and criminal cases against him and his company, according
            to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Cinnabon 880-Calorie Cult Has Americans Licking Fingers:
            Retail &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Cinnabon's signature product is an
            880-calorie cinnamon roll that the Dallas Observer has called a
            'gut bomb.' It's a swirly pillow of dough dripping with
            cinnamon, brown sugar, margarine, and cream-cheese frosting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Death Dinners at Baby Boomers' Tables Take on Taboo Over
            Dying &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- At a Manhattan dinner party, former
            Citigroup Inc. executive Steffen Landauer gathered an eclectic
            mix of guests at his apartment off Fifth Avenue to sip pinot
            noir, dine on seared salmon -- and talk about death. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;6. Apple Sells Record 9 Million IPhones in Their Debut Weekend &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. sold a record 9 million
            iPhones in the weekend debut of two new models, as the company
            included China in the rollout and consumers snapped up handsets
            with more colorful options and a fingerprint reader. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;7. Soros to Goldman Poised to Win on Crisis Housing Bet:
            Mortgages &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
            Chase Co. and billionaire George Soros are poised for gains
            from a housing bet placed in the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;8. BlackBerry Agrees to $4.7 Billion Buyout Deal to Go Private &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- BlackBerry Ltd. reached a tentative
            agreement for a $4.7 billion buyout by a group led by its
            biggest shareholder, forging a path to go private after years of
            losing ground to Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Google Inc.'s Android. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;9. Stocks at Risk With Government Shutdown Looming Before a
            Default &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Even as the U.S. stock market roars
            to new highs, helped last week by the Federal Reserve, a risk is
            rising from another corner of Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10. Deutsche Bank Said to Propose Creating Bond Platform With
            Rivals &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG is trying to drum
            up interest with some of its largest competitors to create a
            multi-dealer U.S. bond trading platform at the same time that
            asset managers discuss ways to make buying and selling debt
            easier, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. Cotton-Candy IOS 7 Masks Potent Apple Upgrade: Rich
            Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Shiny new iPhones always get the
            most attention. But it's iOS 7, the updated version of Apple's
            mobile-device operating system, that will have the biggest
            impact on users. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Does 'Grand Theft Auto V' Mean the End of Hollywood?: Charles
            Yu &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- There's a good chance you've heard:
            'Grand Theft Auto V,' the latest installment of the storied
            video game franchise, took in over $1 billion in its first week.
            That's more than any movie released this year, with the
            exception of''Iron Man 3''(which happens to be the fifth
            highest-grossing movie of all time).'At this rate, 'GTA V'
            could be a nontrivial contributor to the U.S. gross domestic
            product. It's a cultural event. Even Apple Inc. should be
            impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Why France Shrugs at NSA Eavesdropping Revelations: Peter
            Gumbel &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- At the United Nations General
            Assembly yesterday, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff condemned
            the surveillance of electronic communications around the globe
            by the U.S. National Security Agency as a breach of individual
            rights and national sovereignty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Maybe New Zealand Has the Answer to Asset Bubbles: William
            Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- As the world's biggest economies
            search for ways to let the air out of giant asset bubbles, they
            might find some answers in tiny New Zealand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Republicans Cower as Cruz Makes His Last Stand: Margaret
            Carlson &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Move over Rand Paul. Ted Cruz may
            be cruising to the biggest loss in his short career as a U.S.
            senator and surpass you as the pre-eminent conservative in
            Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Boomers Find They Need to Work to Support Retirement &lt;/h2&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Sees Covered Bond Purchases as ECB's First Port of Call</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank will
            start its asset-purchase program with covered bonds because
            large trades in the debt are easier than for asset-backed
            securities, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new-issue market for covered notes is more active than
            for asset-backed debt and investors typically hold larger
            amounts than ABS buyers, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
            wrote in a note to clients. With 791 billion euros ($1 trillion)
            of covered bonds outstanding, compared with 251 billion euros of
            ABS, the central bank will also find it easier to expand its
            balance sheet, Davies said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers are seeking to spur economic growth by
            encouraging lending and will disclose the size and details of
            the program after policy makers meet this week. ECB President
            Mario Draghi, who has made the revival of the ABS market a top
            priority this year as he seeks to channel credit to businesses
            by freeing up bank balance sheets, mentioned purchases of
            covered bonds for the first time this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The ECB is likely to begin its purchase program in the
            covered bond space as it is unlikely to be able to do meaningful
            size in the ABS market,' London-based Davies said in a
            telephone interview today. 'If the ECB wants a strong sentiment
            change by making large purchases it's hard to do that in the
            secondary or new-issue ABS markets as there quite simply aren't
            enough bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The debt-buying plans have been greeted with skepticism by
            investors who suggest the central bank will struggle to buy
            enough securities after the market contracted more than 40
            percent since 2010. Covered bond purchases are being considered
            to expand the amount of assets available to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Retained ABS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Draghi said earlier this month the Frankfurt-based central
            bank will buy a broad portfolio of 'simple and transparent
            securities' that will include ABS and covered bonds. While
            declining to disclose the size of the program, he signaled a
            willingness to grow the ECB's balance sheet by as much 1
            trillion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Europe's public ABS market isn't big enough to achieve that
            goal and purchases of the 635 billion euros of notes created and
            retained by banks to use as collateral for central bank funding
            during the financial crisis wouldn't effect the ECB's balance
            sheet, said Davies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create asset-backed securities by bundling individual
            loans such as mortgages, auto credit and credit-card debt.
            Covered bonds are guaranteed by the issuer and have a designated
            pool of assets, such as mortgages and public sector loans, which
            can be used to meet payments if the issuer can't. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>McCain Pressures Justice to Hold JPMorgan Executives Accountable</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator John McCain pressured
            the Justice Department to hold JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) executives
            individually accountable while they work to settle claims that
            the bank packaged and sold bad mortgage bonds to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Will you seek to hold any top officer, director or key
            employees within JPMorgan personally accountable for the
            wrongdoing?' McCain, of Arizona, wrote in a letter today to
            Attorney General Eric Holder. McCain, the ranking Republican on
            a Senate subcommittee that probed JPMorgan's record trading loss
            last year, criticized Holder's Sept. 26 meeting with Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, calling it 'highly unusual.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender is in talks to pay about $11 billion to end
            investigations by state and federal authorities into its
            mortgage-bond sales practices, according to people familiar with
            the talks, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are
            private. The discussions are fluid and the size of the
            settlement keeps changing, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McCain asked Holder whether the settlement being discussed
            will preclude civil or criminal actions against JPMorgan
            executives and whether the structure of the deal will allow the
            New York-based bank to receive tax breaks on fines or penalties
            it may pay, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Fund Joins Tax Lawsuits Seen Costing U.K. $1.6 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. tax officials may have to pay
            out 1 billion pounds ($1.62 billion) to about 100 investment
            funds -- including some run by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Royal
            Bank of Scotland Group Plc -- suing for the return of overpaid
            taxes dating back two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her Majesty's Revenue Customs won't disclose what it may
            owe the funds in lawsuits stemming from a 2007 European Court
            ruling that investment trusts were improperly charged value-added tax on management fees. Marc Welby, a
            partner at
            accounting firm BDO LLP estimated the agency might have to
            refund about 1 billion pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The litigation 'is about investment trusts who feel short-changed over the way in which HMRC
            handled claims,' said Welby,
            a London tax specialist who isn't involved in the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. lawmakers have publicly censured companies including
            Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) for using legal loopholes to
            minimize taxes. At the same time, the agency in charge of
            collecting them is fighting in the courts to avoid refunds that
            could cost the government billions of pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 120 investment trusts, including others operated by
            BlackRock Inc. (BLK), Schroders Plc (SDR) and Investec Plc, have sued HMRC
            since May 2012, according to court filings that didn't show the
            reason for the suits. Two people familiar with the actions said
            at least 100 of them are related to overpaid VAT. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>JPMorgan Loses Ruling on Class Certification in RMBS Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) lost a bid to
            block buyers of $10 billion worth of residential mortgage-backed
            securities it packaged in 2007 to proceed as a group with their
            lawsuit alleging the bank misled them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan today ruled
            that the claims of investors in nine separate offerings of the
            securities were similar enough for them to move forward as a
            class on the question of whether JPMorgan is liable for making
            false and misleading statements in the offering documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling only applies to liability. Oetken said he wasn't
            convinced at this stage that there's a damages calculation that
            would cover the claims of all the investors included in the
            group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last year agreed to a $13 billion settlement with
            the U.S. to resolve allegations the bank misled investors in
            mortgage-backed securities about the soundness and risks of the
            investments that helped bring on subprime-mortgage crisis of
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because the class is currently certified for liability
            purposes, this phase of litigation will focus on the issue of
            whether defendants made material false statements or omissions
            in the offering documents that affected the value of the
            certificates owned by the plaintiff class members,' the judge
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
            declined to comment on today's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Class certification will allow individual investors who
            haven't filed a lawsuit to be represented by the lead plaintiff
            in a single case because their experiences and legal claims are
            similar. Class-action status is less expensive for plaintiffs
            than filing multiple lawsuits and provides leverage in
            settlement negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Fort Worth Employees' Retirement Fund v. J.P.
            Morgan Chase Co., 09-cv-3701, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
