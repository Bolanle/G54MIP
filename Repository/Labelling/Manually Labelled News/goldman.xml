        <headline>Fortress Hires Goldman Sachs' Shell to Start Growth Equity Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) said
            it hired David Shell to start a new growth equity business for
            institutional investors at its Logan Circle Partners unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shell previously was co-chief investment officer of the
            growth equities investment team at Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management, where he was responsible for about $20 billion in
            client assets, New York-based Fortress said today in a
            statement. The appointment of Shell, who will be based in Tampa,
            Florida, marks the addition of institutional equities at Logan
            Circle, which manages about $21 billion across 15 fixed-income
            strategies, Fortress said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Loan Talk Propels Biggest Bond Advance: Argentina Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina's effort to repair ties
            with overseas investors is starting to yield results in the bond
            market as the country tries to stem a plunge in foreign-currency
            reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Its dollar-denominated notes surged by the most of any
            emerging market, adding to a 9.2 percent rally in March, after
            the government said it received loan proposals from
            international investment banks. The statement was in response to
            a newspaper report on March 30 that said Argentina is close to
            getting a two-year, $1 billion loan from Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, less than the nation's
            similar-maturity bonds that yield 11.28 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The loan would provide Argentina, which hasn't issued
            overseas bonds since its $95 billion default in 2001, with a
            crucial source of hard currency at a time when the reserves it
            uses to pay debt are at a seven-year low. The financing would
            also show President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is succeeding
            in restoring investor confidence after settling creditor
            disputes at the World Bank, agreeing to compensate Repsol SA for
            its seizure of YPF SA and revamping its inflation index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market has been optimistic about Argentina for a
            while now due to the change in attitude toward more pragmatic
            and orthodox policies,' Diego Ferro, the co-chief investment
            officer at Greylock Capital Management LLC in New York, said by
            e-mail. 'In that context, regaining market access would be a
            logical step.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Budget Deficit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
            on any proposals or talks with Argentina. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank is negotiating the final details of the
            loan with Goldman Sachs including guarantees, Buenos Aires-based
            newspaper Pagina/12 reported, citing a government official it
            didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bond-market advance pushed down Argentina's average
            yields to 10.8 percent. As recently as Feb. 3, they were as high
            as 13.61 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Economy Ministry said in a statement on March 30 that
            while the government isn't planning any foreign currency debt
            sales in the short term, it has received proposals from
            investment banks it didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Different financial entities have presented proposals to
            obtain foreign financing at maturities and interest rates in
            line with other countries in the region,' the ministry said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Subsidy Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fernandez, hamstrung by a growing fiscal deficit and a
            shrinking trade surplus, has authorized her economic team led by
            Economy Minister Axel Kicillof to settle decade-old investment
            disputes to gain access to fresh financing before the end of her
            term late next year. Argentina will begin to cut gas and water
            subsidies by 20 percent beginning today. Utility rates have been
            largely frozen since 2003 and an increase in gas imports have
            drained reserves as domestic output declines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given what they've been doing in recent days like changes
            to subsidies, they're cognizant of the need to maintain this
            change in policy,' Marco Santamaria, a money manager at
            AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees $25 billion in emerging-market debt, said by phone from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robert Abad, who helps oversee about $53 billion of
            emerging-market debt at Western Asset Management Co., said
            Argentina's legal dispute with creditors who rejected its debt
            restructurings will continue to make it difficult for Argentina
            to obtain the financing it needs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Holdout Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Creditors led by Elliott Management Corp.'s Paul Singer
            have won lower court rulings to be paid in full at the same time
            Argentina services its restructured debt. The effects of the
            ruling are on hold pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
            About 93 percent of creditors accepted losses of 70 percent in
            the restructurings. Argentina has said paying holdouts in full
            could expose it to $43 billion of claims that would lead it to
            default again. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They have a lot more work to do, a loan here and a loan
            there won't bring liquidity relief that makes the math
            sustainable,' Abad said in a telephone interview from Pasadena,
            California. 'This legal issue can create a big dent to what
            happens. It's hard to set the parameters to how much they have
            to set aside.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government has $5.9 billion of bonds due in October
            2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentina obtained $938 million in financing from the
            Inter-American Development Bank during meetings on March 29,
            Buenos Aires-based newspaper Ambito Financiero reported
            yesterday. The government is also in 'advanced talks' with the
            World Bank for $3 billion of loans, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'High Probability' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Argentine bonds will continue to gain, according to
            Barclays Plc. Average yields are still double the average in
            emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Valuations are still attractive, and the market will
            continue to rally,' Donato Guarino, a strategist at Barclays,
            said in a telephone interview from New York. 'There's a high
            probability that they will get back on the international
            market.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Seek Sale of NYSE Market-Making Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is seeking a buyer for its New York Stock Exchange designated
            market-making business acquired through the 2000 purchase of Spear, Leeds Kellogg, a person briefed on the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank is in the early stages of the process and has held talks with
            potential buyers, according to the person, who requested anonymity because the discussions are private. The
            Financial Times reported on the planned sale earlier today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reaps
            the most revenue from equities trading among banks globally, paid about $5.4 billion in stock and cash for
            Spear Leeds. The purchase remains the biggest in the history of the firm, which is the world's largest
            adviser on mergers and acquisitions in 11 of the past 13 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The business for sale is now valued at about $30 million, the FT reported, citing
            analysts it didn't identify. Last year, Goldman Sachs agreed to sell a majority stake in its Redi
            trading-technology unit that was based on software acquired when it bought Spear Leeds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffany
            Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the company doesn't comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            NYSE, purchased in November by Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc., relies on traders known as
            designated market makers, or DMMs, to facilitate buying and selling. The firms help run the opening and
            closing auctions of NYSE-listed stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said in Talks to Sell NYSE Trading Unit to IMC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;IMC Financial Markets is in talks to
            buy Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s New York Stock Exchange market-making unit, two people familiar with the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is seeking as much as $30 million for the
            business, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the negotiations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. (ICE)'s NYSE relies on
            traders known as designated market markers, or DMMs, to
            facilitate the buying and selling of shares. Barclays Plc and
            KCG Holdings Inc. are the biggest DMMs, followed by Goldman
            Sachs and Virtu Financial Inc., according to a person with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IMC, which stands for International Marketmakers
            Combination, is a trading firm and asset manager founded in
            Amsterdam in 1989. It has U.S. offices in Chicago and New York,
            and trades on more than 90 exchanges around the world, according
            to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Remco Lenterman, an IMC managing director, and Tiffany Galvin of New York-based Goldman Sachs said
            their respective
            companies don't comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Citic Pacific's Bonds Surge by Record as Goldman Sees Positives</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citic Pacific Ltd.'s perpetual bonds
            have jumped by a record since the steelmaker said last week it
            will buy its parent's main operating unit, a move Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. says may help improve corporate governance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices on the manufacturer's dollar-denominated 8.625
            percent notes with no set maturity have leapt 9.9 cents on the
            dollar since March 25 to 107.01, the most for any five-business-day period, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The company
            said on March 26 it will absorb about $36 billion of assets from
            state-owned parent Citic Group Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman removed Citic Pacific's perpetual securities from a
            list of its least favored bonds, according to a research note
            dated March 30. The deal comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping
            advocates the most sweeping changes since Deng Xiaoping's
            liberalization in 1978, including loosening yuan trading and
            allowing more private investments in state businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the transaction is completed, we believe it should
            help to improve corporate governance for the group,' said
            analysts led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho in a March 31 note.
            'If the Citic Pacific acquisition does materialize, and this is
            accompanied by significant equity injection, then we would view
            it as a clear credit positive for Citic Pacific.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company plans to sell about $4 billion of shares to
            restore its public float after absorbing assets from Citic
            Group, people with knowledge of the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shinhan Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the dollar bond market in Asia, South Korea's
            Shinhan Bank is marketing a three-year floating-rate debenture
            at about 80 basis points more than the three-month London
            interbank offered rate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds from
            default in Asia-Pacific fell today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
            borrowers outside Japan decreased 2 basis points to 125 basis
            points as of 8:41 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia New Zealand
            Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is poised for a third
            straight day of declines, the longest streak of losses since the
            period ended March 7, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 0.5 basis point
            to 100.3 as of 11:24 a.m. in Sydney, according to Citigroup Inc.
            prices. The benchmark is poised for its lowest close since Feb.
            18 after a 1.9 basis point drop last week, CMA data shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 0.3 basis point to
            84 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup prices show.
            The measure, which fell 4.3 basis points last week, the most
            since the five-day period ended Feb. 21, is on track for its
            lowest close since March 19, according to CMA, which is owned by
            McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
            private market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
            bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
            credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
            creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
            the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
            agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hewlett-Packard Falls on Goldman Downgrade: San Francisco Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) fell the most in
            more than four months after Bill Shope, an analyst at Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., downgraded the shares amid a continuing slump
            in personal-computer sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares dropped 5.2 percent to $22.10 at 10:11 a.m. in
            New York, and earlier touched $21.90 for the biggest intraday
            decline since Nov. 20. Shope downgraded the stock to sell from
            neutral and has a $16 target price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before today, Hewlett-Packard had surged 64 percent this
            year on optimism that Meg Whitman, the fourth CEO in three
            years, could engineer a turnaround. She showed early signs of
            progress in February, forecasting fiscal second-quarter profit
            that beat estimates as cost cutting and rebounding demand for
            enterprise services helped offset waning demand for PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Sentiment has moved ahead of reality,' Shope wrote in a
            research report today. He predicted that the shares could fall
            31 percent from yesterday's closing price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The current restructuring actions will be largely
            countered by incremental weakness in PCs, enterprise hardware,
            services and printing in fiscal 2013,' Shope said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global PC shipments may fall 1.3 percent to 345.8 million
            units this year, from 350.4 million in 2012, researcher IDC said
            last month. Last year, shipments declined 3.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wiet Pot Said to Circle Back for Goldman's Trading Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wiet Pot, co-head of the Dutch high-speed trading firm that's said to be bidding for Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc.'s floor-trading business, is a former partner of the
            investment bank who once helped run its equities division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pot's IMC Financial Markets has expanded from Amsterdam to
            Chicago and Sydney, where it uses algorithms to make markets in
            stocks, commodities and currencies. Pot serves with Rob Defares,
            one of IMC's founders, as co-chief executive officer at IMC,
            which he joined in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The right to make markets on the New York Stock Exchange
            floor was once a license to mint money by collecting the
            customary 12.5-cent spread between purchases and sales. The
            huddles of traders at the Big Board have been shrinking since
            regulators allowed brokers to quote prices in pennies.
            Computerized traders like IMC are still able to eke out profits
            on the smaller spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two of the biggest high-frequency firms, Virtu Financial
            Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc., have already taken over much of what
            used to be called the specialist business, the niche that
            Goldman Sachs is now exiting. Goldman Sachs, which valued its

        <headline>Nordea Vaults to Top Underwriter as Goldman Drops: Nordic Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nordea Bank AB (NDA) jumped to the top of
            the Nordic region's bond underwriter rankings in the first
            quarter as the lender helped companies such as Telenor ASA sell
            cross-border deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest Nordic bank underwrote $6.3 billion in bonds,
            boosting its market share by 5 percentage points from a year
            earlier to 12.7 percent, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. SEB AB rose to second spot from fourth, grabbing 8
            percent of the market through $3.9 billion in deals. The figures
            include corporate and financial issuance and exclude public-sector bonds and financing on their own behalf.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've seen increasing willingness by Nordic corporates to
            consider issuance in Nordic currencies other than their own,'
            Thomas Begley, Nordea's head of fixed income in Helsinki, said
            in a phone interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Norwegian companies led the way in the period in selling
            bonds outside their home market, targeting Swedish investors
            hungry for yield. Cross-border deals helped Nordea withstand a
            broader decline in debt sales in the first quarter as issuance,
            which surged in 2012 and early last year, abates amid a pick-up
            in lending after banks built up buffers to meet stricter capital
            requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Norwegian Kronor &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sweden's central bank in December cut its main interest
            rates to 0.75 percent, while Norway's central bank, whose
            benchmark is 1.5 percent, delayed a plan to raise borrowing
            costs by at least a year to the summer of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and a group
            of cable makers including Nexans SA (NEX) were fined a total of 301.6
            million euros ($416 million) by the European Union for fixing
            the price of high-voltage power cables sold to energy providers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shared a fine of 37.3 million euros with
            Prysmian SpA (PRY), an Italian cable maker that Goldman Sachs Capital
            Partners bought in 2005. Prysmian also shared a 67.3 million-euro fine with its former owner Pirelli C. SpA.
            (PC) Nexans SA, the
            world's second-biggest cable maker, was fined 70.7 million
            euros, less than the 200 million euros it had booked. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fines add to a 953 million-euro penalty for car-parts
            makers last month and a record 1.7 billion euros last year for
            banks and a broker that rigged interest-rate benchmarks.
            Breaking up cartels and levying high fines to deter price-fixing
            is one of the EU's priorities, according to Joaquin Almunia, the
            bloc's antitrust chief. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These companies knew very well that what they were doing
            was illegal. This is why they acted cautiously and with great
            secrecy,' Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. 'Despite this
            and through joint efforts by several competition authorities
            around the world, we have detected their anti-competitive
            agreements and brought them to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is looking to sell its New York Stock Exchange market-making unit to
            a Dutch investment firm, as computers replace traders who once dominated the business at the corner of Wall
            and Broad streets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC Financial Markets is negotiating to buy the floor-trading
            business, according to two people familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity because talks are
            private. Goldman Sachs is seeking as much as $30 million, one person said. The investment bank, which joined
            the NYSE in 1896, bought the operations in 2000 as part of a $5.4 billion purchase of Spear, Leeds Kellogg.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The NYSE's huddles of traders have been shrinking for years as more transactions are
            handled electronically, making humans less integral. Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc.
            pledged to preserve the trading floor in lower Manhattan when it agreed to buy the exchange in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The business has evolved away from humans on the exchange,' said Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP
            Group Inc. 'Only a fraction is being done on the floor with humans versus how much is being done
            electronically.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC, which stands for International Marketmakers Combination, is a
            high-frequency trading firm and asset manager founded in Amsterdam in 1989. It has offices in Chicago and
            New York, and conducts transactions on more than 90 exchanges around the world, according to its website.
            Remco Lenterman, an IMC managing director, and Tiffany Galvin of New York-based Goldman Sachs said their
            companies don't comment on speculation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Sachs Trader Taylor Said to Surrender to FBI</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            traderMatthew Taylor surrendered to the Federal Bureau of
            Investigation at about 8:30 a.m. this morning as part of a
            U.S. securities fraud investigation, a person familiar with the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taylor is to appear in Manhattan federal court later today.
            He was accused Nov. 8 in a lawsuit by the U.S. Commodity Futures
            Trading Commission of concealing an $8.3 billion position in
            2007 that caused New York-based Goldman Sachs to lose
            $118 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley hired Taylor in March 2008 after Goldman
            Sachs fired him three months earlier. Goldman cited 'alleged
            conduct related to inappropriately large proprietary futures
            positions in a firm trading account,' in a so-called U-5 form,
            according to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), which had employed Taylor
            before he joined Goldman Sachs in 2005, hired him after a
            subprime mortgage-related trading position resulted in a
            $9.4 billion writedown in December 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Equity Derivative &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taylor, who handled client-related equity derivative
            trading at Morgan Stanley, left the firm in July, the company
            said last year. Taylor's departure wasn't related to the CFTC
            complaint, said a person familiar with the situation who asked
            not to be identified because the information was private. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s fund
            management arm is overweight on Slovenia's bonds and may buy
            more as it believes the challenges facing the Alpine nation
            won't force the sovereign into debt restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on Slovenian dollar-denominated notes due 2022 fell
            nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to a one-week low
            of 5.9 percent by 4:07 p.m. in Ljubljana, 48 basis points below
            last week's record high, according to data complied by
            Bloomberg. The country's bonds tumbled over the last two weeks
            on speculation it may be the next euro member to ask for a
            bailout after Cyprus's emergency tax plans soured sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management may expand its 'modest'
            overweight position in Slovene bonds if the selloff caused by
            ripples from Cypriot efforts to obtain aid resumes, according to
            Sam Finkelstein, a money manager who helps manage $40 billion in
            emerging-market debt at the company. While Slovenia's banks are
            saddled with bad debts amid a second recession since 2009, the
            financial industry is less bloated then in some European Union
            peers, he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very solid investment story and not the same
            issues that faced either Greece or Cyprus,' Finkelstein said by
            phone from London today. 'If there is further contagion, we'd
            be looking to buy that dip.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slovenia's crisis isn't 'insurmountable,' Bostjan Jazbec,
            approved by lawmakers as Slovenia's next central bank president
            this week, said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the country faces 'a number of challenges' and has
            a 'weak' coalition government, its 'banking sector is not
            large compared to other EU members and debt-to-GDP is low,'
            Finkelstein said. 'The remedy to their challenges is not a
            haircut to the government debt. So I'm very comfortable with an
            investment in Slovenia.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
            Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $6 million cash
            bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets,
            on top of $23 million in 2013 compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The award can shrink or grow depending on whether the firm
            achieves return-on-equity and book-value targets, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The
            long-term incentive was
            $5 million last year and $3 million in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 59, was the highest-paid CEO among peers at the
            largest U.S. banks for a second straight year. Goldman Sachs had
            an 11 percent return on equity in 2013, topping its largest Wall
            Street rivals, as it cut compensation costs amid revenue that
            was little changed. The stock rose 39 percent last year, beating
            the 33 percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Financials
            Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already
            gives a majority of top executives' pay in restricted stock,
            have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term performance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Details of Blankfein's pay were contained in the bank's
            proxy statement for its annual shareholders' meeting, which will
            be held on May 16 in Irving, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's total compensation package of $29 million
            topped the $20 million given to JPMorgan Chase Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, 58, and the $18 million for Morgan
            Stanley CEO James Gorman, 55. Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian T. Moynihan, 54,
            received $14 million and Citigroup Inc.'s Michael Corbat, 53,
            got $14.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Boosts U.S. Gas Price Forecast After Temperatures Drop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
            forecast for U.S. natural gas futures for the remainder of this
            year on a 'tightening shift' in market fundamentals after
            temperatures fell last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures in New York will average $4.40 per million British
            thermal units for the balance of 2013, Goldman said in a report
            e-mailed today. That's a 17 percent increase from its previous
            forecast of $3.75. Cold weather in the U.S. reduced inventories
            to 1.7 trillion cubic feet at the end of last month, from 2.5
            trillion a year ago, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the need for more production and less need for
            coal-to-gas switching will allow prices to move higher,' said
            Johan Spetz, a commodity analyst at Goldman in New York. 'A
            return to growing production is required to balance the market
            after this summer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Benchmark natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile
            Exchange climbed 15 percent in March, the most in half a year,
            as cold weather increased demand and drained stockpiles in the
            U.S. The contract for May delivery was at $3.96 per million
            British thermal units, up 0.3 percent, in electronic trading on
            Nymex today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman also opened a trading recommendation to buy call
            options on gas for November 2013 at $4.20 per million British
            thermal units. The bank maintained its forecast for 2014 at
            $4.25, citing a possible increase in supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe prices are likely to face resistance above
            $4.25 in the near term as coal-to-gas switching is still needed
            to balance the market,' Spetz said. 'Net, we expect U.S.
            natural gas production to be flat year-on-year in 2013 before
            returning to close to 2 billion cubic feet a day growth in 2014
            year-on-year.' &lt;/p&gt;

            of LaNasa's former colleagues at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
            Leslie Biddle and Daniel Eichner, according to a person familiar
            with the appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Biddle will work with LaNasa and partner Vivian Lau, both
            former Goldman colleagues, on investments in energy, power and
            natural resources, said the person, who asked not to be

            investing desk in the special situations investments group at
            Goldman. The firm's Serengeti Opportunities Ltd. fund rose 1.4
            percent in March and 8.3 percent this year, after gaining 13
            percent in 2012, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mary Beth Grover, a spokeswoman for Serengeti at the
            Abernathy MacGregor Group, declined to comment on the
            appointments and the returns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Biddle, who joined Serengeti as partner, will also help run
            the firm with LaNasa and Lau, with responsibilities in
            investments and business development, the person said. Biddle
            was a senior partner at Goldman Sachs, according to the person,
            where she was global head of commodity sales and chief financial
            officer of metals and mining investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Eichner, Lau &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eichner worked for LaNasa before and was an analyst in
            Goldman Sachs's special situations investments group in 2002 and
            2003, the person said. He joined from Garrison Investment Group
            LP, where he was responsible for investor relations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lau joined Serengeti in 2008. Before that, she worked at
            Goldman Sachs for eight years and co-ran the multistrategy
            investment business in the special situations group, the person
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Most Read on Bloomberg: Lewis, Speed Trades, Currencies, Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Lewis Likens Einhorn to 'Dumb Tourist' in Fixed Card Game &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 2 (Bloomberg) -- In today's 'rigged' U.S. stock
            market, large investors such as Greenlight Capital Inc.'s David
            Einhorn are like 'dumb tourists' led to a casino where the
            card games are fixed, according to Michael Lewis, whose book
            'Flash Boys' has touched off a national debate about high-frequency trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Stock Trader Speed Craze Threatens Stability, Schneiderman
            Says &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;March 31 (Bloomberg) -- The technological arms race among
            professional equity traders threatens to destabilize U.S.
            markets and more should be done to limit their speed, according
            to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. 'Shame on You' Is Bats Executive's Rebuttal of Michael Lewis &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 1 (Bloomberg) -- Author Michael Lewis's argument that
            U.S. stock trading is rigged reflects a misunderstanding of how
            the market operates and its history, said Bill O'Brien, the
            president of exchange operator Bats Global Markets Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. High-Frequency Traders Chase Currencies as Stock Volume
            Recedes &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 2 (Bloomberg) -- Forget the equity market. For high-frequency traders, the place to be is
            foreign exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;5. Stocks Fall as Nasdaq Tumbles; Treasuries Rally on Jobs
            Report &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 4 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks tumbled, with the Nasdaq
            Composite Index falling the most in two months, as investors
            continued a selloff of the bull market's biggest winners.
            Treasuries rallied as jobs data boosted speculation the Federal
            Reserve will remain accommodative on rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;6. Goldman Sachs Wins, Credit Suisse Loses in Lewis's League
            Table &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 4 (Bloomberg) -- Just as Wall Street league tables
            rank firms by the size of their deals, author Michael Lewis
            provides his own hierarchy in the way his latest book describes
            banks' stock-trading divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;7. Hedge Fund March Letters to Tell of Favorite Trades
            Unraveling &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;March 31 (Bloomberg) -- Pity the poor folks who have to
            write letters to investors on behalf of equity-focused hedge
            funds this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;8. Jeter's Agent Beats Jay Z With $700 Million MLB Offseason &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;March 31 (Bloomberg) -- Casey Close has become one of Major
            League Baseball's heaviest hitters without swinging a bat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;9. Yellen Says Job-Market Slack Shows Need for More Fed Support &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;March 31 (Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen,
            easing investor concern that interest rates may rise earlier
            than previously forecast, said the world's biggest economy will
            need Fed stimulus for 'some time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10. Companies in U.S. Power Labor Market Past Milestone: Economy &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 4 (Bloomberg) -- Companies powered the U.S. job
            market past a milestone in March as private employment exceeded
            the pre-recession peak for the first time, showing the kind of
            progress Federal Reserve officials look for to maintain their
            current policy course. &lt;/p&gt;

            Line &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 4 (Bloomberg) -- 'I'm from the B-R-double-O-K, L-Y-N
            If I wasn't, then why would I yell I am? You see, this be the
            home of Spike Lee. Folks think it's dangerous -- I don't know
            it might be slightly. But that depends on which blocks you be
            steppin' down. Cause certain neighborhoods they never put they
            weapon down.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Citigroup, Credit Suisse Tripped Up By Past Sins: Jonathan
            Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;April 3 (Bloomberg) -- Past sins have a funny way of
            catching up with banks, especially those where the bosses have
            trouble keeping track of what goes on inside them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Republican Senate Could Bypass Vetoes: Albert R. Hunt &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;March 30 (Bloomberg) -- If Republicans take control of the
            U.S. Senate in this year's elections, it will be, as Vice
            President Joe Biden might put it more graphically, a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Abe's 200,000 Immigrant Dream Is Wage Nightmare: William
            Pesek &lt;/p&gt;

            250. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. China's $14.5 Billion Scandal Rocks Xi's Party: William Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;March 31 (Bloomberg) -- It's great that China's President
            Xi Jinping is pouncing on ex-security chief Zhou Yongkang. By
            seizing assets worth an estimated $14.5 billion and launching
            the biggest corruption probe in modern history, Xi is showing
            he's serious about curbing the excesses imperiling China's
            future. Right? &lt;/p&gt;

            about the decision to leave the benchmark interest rate
            unchanged at a record low of 0.25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

            Inc., and Michael Lewis, author of 'Flash Boys,' talk about

        <headline>Goldman Sees Chance to Cut Its China Junk Debt Holdings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says now
            may be a good time to cut holdings of Chinese high-yield bonds
            after the longest winning streak in six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors should use the recent rally to reduce
            overweight positions,' analysts led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a note dated April 4. 'We believe
            that there will
            be more headlines noises to come out of China and expect to see
            further credit differentiation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar-denominated junk bonds from the nation gained 0.95
            percent in the seven days through April 4 for the second
            straight weekly advance, according to Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch indexes. While recent improvement in emerging-market
            sentiment and China's announcement of stimulus last week fueled
            the rally, better-quality issuers remain Goldman's preferred bet
            amid continued concern about the world's second-biggest economy,
            according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China unveiled a package of measures to support the economy
            including railway investment and tax breaks last week, as the
            government seeks to bolster slowing growth. Exports (CNFREXPY) likely rose
            4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the
            median estimate of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before
            trade data this week, after the biggest drop since 2009 in
            February. Manufacturing contracted a third month in March, an
            HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics gauge showed last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sinopec Sells &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group and
            parent of Asia's largest oil refiner, sold $5 billion of bonds
            on April 2, the biggest dollar-denominated sale by an Asian
            issuer in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China Citic
            Bank International Ltd. meets investors from today about a
            possible offering of notes in the U.S. currency, a person
            familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect China issuance to increase and to catch up in
            the remaining quarters, especially given the improvement in
            market sentiment in recent weeks,' wrote Ho. Offerings from the
            nation slumped to $12.7 billion in the first three months of the
            year, from $15.1 billion during the same period last year,
            according to Goldman data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka plans to sell as much as $500 million of notes as
            soon as today, a person familiar with the matter said. The
            sovereign is marketing five-year bonds at about 5.5 percent, the
            person said, asking not to be identified because the terms
            aren't set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pakistan plans to price five- and 10-year dollar-denominated debt as soon as tomorrow, a separate
            person said.
            Bangladesh's Banglalink Digital Communications Ltd. is
            considering a $300 million offering of five-year securities,
            Moody's Investors Service wrote in an e-mailed note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring Asian corporate and sovereign bonds
            from default was little changed today, according to traders of
            credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asia Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
            borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 124 basis points
            as of 8:08 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia New Zealand Banking
            Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark is holding at its lowest
            level since April 2, when it touched a six-month low, according
            to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
            quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index slipped 0.5 basis point
            to 97.5 basis points as of 9:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to
            Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge is on course for its lowest
            close since April 2, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 83.5
            basis points as of 8:40 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
            bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
            credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
            creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
            the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
            agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Biofarma Says Owners Hire Goldman Sachs for Sale of Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Biofarma Pharmaceutical Industry Co.'s owners hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to start the process
            of selling a stake in the Turkish drugmaker, Chief Executive Officer Serdar Sozeri said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            sent out so-called teasers, or invitation letters, to potential bidders for stock in the Istanbul-based
            company, which is owned equally by New York-based private-equity firm Rohatyn Group and another buyout
            investor group that Sozeri, speaking in a phone interview, identified as Spokane while declining to specify
            other details. He also declined to comment on the size of any holding that might be offered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citi
            Venture Capital International, a unit of Citigroup Inc. (C) that was sold to Rohatyn Group last year, and
            Partners in Life Sciences bought Biofarma, a generic producer of heart, respiratory and urinary-tract
            treatments, from its Turkish owners in 2006. A stake was sold to Greek private-equity firm Global Finance in
            2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An attempt to sell the drugmaker in 2011 failed over price, with a person familiar
            with the situation at the time estimating the drugmaker was valued at $600 million to $700 million. A
            spokesman for Rohatyn didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bayer AG,
            GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), Novartis AG (NOVN), AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) and Amgen Inc. are among more than 30
            international drugmakers operating in Turkey, a medicines market that expanded 6.5 percent to 15.2 billion
            liras ($7.2 billion) in 2013, according to the website of the Istanbul-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers'
            Association of Turkey. Biofarma's revenue in 2010 totaled 160 million liras, according to Istanbul Chamber
            of Industry figures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Targets Small Loans in Yield Hunt: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit is
            joining firms from Ares Capital Corp. (ARCC) to Fifth Street Finance
            Corp. (FSC) in raising about $2 billion to lend to companies unable to
            tap public markets as investors seek to extract high yields. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Liberty Harbor Capital LLC, which is
            organized as a so-called business-development company and
            primarily lends to companies earning less than $75 million,
            plans to raise money in an initial public offering, according to
            a March 29 regulatory filing. Last week, New York-based Ares
            Capital, the largest BDC, raised about $290 million by selling
            shares, while Garrison Capital Inc. completed its IPO. Fifth
            Street Finance said it may raise $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The flurry underscores the lengths investors are willing to
            go to in order to generate returns as the Federal Reserve keeps
            benchmark interest rates near zero for a fifth year. While the
            debt the BDCs are buying generate yields of 10 percent or more,
            it doesn't typically trade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Banks have largely abandoned the field in direct lending
            to the mid-market and it's been taken over in the last few years
            by BDCs and private funds,' Nicholas Marshi, the chief
            investment officer at Southland Capital Management, said in a
            telephone interview from Santa Monica, California. Marshi
            manages funds that invest in BDCs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Glencore to Goldman Face 3-Year Wait on New Colombia Rail</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A project to double capacity of Colombia's main coal railway is set to take another three years,
            according to the line's operator, curbing government plans to boost exports of the fuel used by European
            power plants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Environmental permitting delays and opposition from local communities have
            held up work, Pat Ross, acting president of Ferrocarriles del Norte de Colombia SA, or Fenoco, said in an
            April 7 interview at the company's Santa Marta offices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., Glencore Xstrata Plc and Drummond Co. are among companies that use the 246 kilometers (153
            miles) of track to transport coal from northern mines to ports on the Caribbean coast, from where it's
            shipped to Europe. A 46-kilometer stretch of single track still needs to be turned into double track, Ross
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The second quarter of 2017 is the deadline at the rate we're going, unless it's
            expedited,' he said. 'As long as you have one kilometer of single track, the inability to optimize our
            resources remains.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, the railway transported 44 million metric tons of coal,
            with a capacity under current contracts of 66.5 million tons, according to Fenoco. 'When the second line is
            completed the capacity will almost double,' Ross said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fenoco has spent $164 million
            since 2007 on an expansion that include a new high-tech signaling system, with a forecast total spend of
            $319 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Drummond Catchup &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies working in the cement,
            oil and oil derivatives industries have expressed interest in using the upgraded line once it's complete,
            Ross said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colombian Mines and Energy Minister Amylkar Acosta said Feb. 20 that
            completion of the second line would help Drummond partially recuperate lost exports after the Birmingham,
            Alabama-based company failed to install a mandatory direct-loading system at its Caribbean port by a Jan. 1
            deadline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ministry didn't reply to two e-mails and a voicemail seeking comment on
            the railway upgrade timeframe. Officials in the communications departments of Glencore's Prodeco and Goldman
            Sachs's Colombian Natural Resources declined to comment when contacted by phone on the railway expansion
            time line. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Juan Manuel Santos has earmarked mining as an engine for the
            country's economy. Coal is Colombia's main export after oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of 11 minerals identified
            as being strategically important, Colombia has the greatest potential in thermal coal, according to a study
            commissioned by the government's mining and energy planning unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Colombia's coal
            reserves are gigantic,' the unit's director, Angela Cadena, said in a March 26 interview. 'The
            reserve-production ratio is close to 100 years.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sees Orban Risk as Hungary Bonds Lag: East Europe Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
            Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's re-election means
            'unpredictable' policies that risk weighing on growth, as the
            nation's bonds suffer East Europe's worst returns after Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Government bonds lost 1.6 percent this year in dollar
            terms, while the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Sovereign Index
            gained 1.6 percent. The forint weakened as much as 0.6 percent
            from a two-month high and bonds dropped yesterday after Orban's
            Fidesz party won 67 percent of the seats in parliament in an
            April 6 vote, according to preliminary results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Orban cut the biggest debt burden among former
            communist European Union members, he roiled investor sentiment
            in his last term by appropriating $13 billion of pension assets,
            saddling banks with mortgage losses and driving out foreign-owned utilities. His 'unpredictable style of
            policymaking'
            will last as his past policies 'weigh on Hungary's growth
            prospects,' Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at
            Goldman Sachs, said by e-mail April 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Fidesz won't really have an incentive to change its
            economic policy after this victory,' Zsolt Kondrat, head of
            research at MKB Bank Zrt., a unit of Bayerische Landesbank, said
            by phone from Budapest yesterday. 'And unless it does, there
            won't be much of a sustained gain in the forint or a drop in
            yields.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Unambiguous' Mandate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MKB expects Hungary's 10-year forint bond yield to rise to
            6.2 percent by the end of the year from a close of 5.66 percent
            yesterday and an average of 5.85 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fidesz secured an 'unambiguous' mandate to continue the
            policy course it started four years ago, Orban said in Budapest
            yesterday. The Economy Ministry declined to respond to e-mailed
            questions regarding the government's future policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hungarian stocks underperformed peers in emerging markets
            during Orban's first term as his government changed the
            constitution, levied extraordinary taxes on industries from
            banks to telecommunications providers, and rejected concern over
            the erosion of democracy as lobbying for foreign interests. The
            BUX index tumbled 29 percent in the past four years compared
            with a 3.2 percent retreat in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Riskless Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While gains of 39 percent on forint-denominated debt were
            the best among the three major eastern European countries since
            Orban took office in May 2010, those returns shrunk to a region-worst 6.6 percent when adjusted for price
            fluctuations,
            according to the Bloomberg riskless return ranking. Polish debt
            handed investors 9.4 percent and Czech securities 7.2 percent in
            a risk-adjusted ranking of indexes from the European Federation
            of Financial Analysts Societies in the period through the end of
            last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orban's cabinet 'will continue to hold an unprecedented
            degree of control over the direction of economic policies,'
            Goldman's Polan wrote. 'The government will press on with its
            plans to extend the state's control over the economy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The premier has used the proceeds from the pension takeover
            and industry taxes to keep the budget deficit below the EU
            ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2011. GDP
            grew 1.1 percent last year after contracting in 2012. Industrial
            production increased 8.1 percent in February from a year
            earlier, the biggest jump in three years, statistics office data
            showed today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hungary's Eurobonds are attractive as the economy picks up
            and the yields exceed peers such as Romania, Gyula Toth, who
            oversees $550 million of assets as a money manager at Ithuba
            Gapital AG in Vienna, said by e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Extra Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The premium investors demand to hold Hungary's dollar bonds
            over Treasuries widened two basis points to 266 today, compared
            with 198 for Romania, according to indexes from JPMorgan Chase
            Co. The forint strengthened 0.3 percent to 305.7 per euro by
            9:31 a.m. in Budapest while yields on the government's 10-year
            local-currency debt fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
            point, to 5.61 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hungary's public debt burden fell to about 78 percent of
            GDP last year from 82 percent in 2010, data from the European
            Commission show. The country's current-account surplus also
            reached a record 2.9 billion euros in 2013, the central bank
            said March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Orban's policies helped reduce Hungary's budget gap,
            domestic yields fell too low after 20 consecutive months of cuts
            in the benchmark interest rate to a record 2.6 percent,
            according to Lutz Roehmeyer, a money manager at Berlin-based LBB
            Invest overseeing $1.1 billion of developing-nation debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Too Low' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Interest rates in Hungary are too low and politically
            influenced by the new setup of the central bank,' he said by e-mail yesterday. 'It doesn't pay to go into
            Hungarian risk,'
            said Roehmeyer, who has an underweight position on the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gyorgy Matolcsy, the central bank's president, was the
            architect of much of Orban's self-styled 'unorthodox' policies
            as the economy minister until March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The election gave an opposition alliance headed by the
            Socialist Party 19 percent of the parliament seats, while the
            Jobbik party, which wants a referendum on EU membership, secured
            12 percent. Jobbik's showing may embolden Fidesz to pursue
            similar or even more drastic policies than it did in its last
            term, Nora Szentivanyi, a London-based economist at JPMorgan,
            said in an e-mailed report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Potential for renewed confrontation with the EU and
            increasingly nationalistic rhetoric are risks worth watching,'
            Szentivanyi wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Strategist Sees High Chance of 10% Market Drop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Kostin has some good news, and some bad news. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First,
            the bad news. There's a good chance the U.S. stock market will see a 10 percent drop sometime during the
            next 12 months. Well, as far as precision goes, 'good chance' is not good enough for a quant like Kostin, so
            he gives an exact probability: 67 percent odds of a 10 percent retreat from a peak in the next 12 months.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though quant work can be complicated, his rationale is actually quite simple -- the
            market has gone way too long without a so-called correction, or a drop of at least 10 percent from a peak.
            The biggest declines from highs this year and last year were about 6 percent, and it's been 22 months since
            the Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) saw a 10 percent drop. Mix in a little fancy math, and Kostin ends up
            with 67 percent odds we'll see a correction in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now for the good
            news, if you can call it that: He still expects the market to end the year higher, though not by much.
            Kostin is sticking with his year-end SP 500 forecast of 1,900, according to a note to clients dated
            yesterday. That implies a gain of less than 2.8 percent for the year and less than 3 percent from
            yesterday's close. In other words, a relatively flat market given the ferocity of the gains seen in this
            bull run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next year will be better in Kostin's view, with a gain of 11 percent to 2,100
            from his 2014 forecast. The SP 500 will add another 4.8 percent on top of that to 2,200 in 2016, he
            predicts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ho Hum &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the year, Wall Street
            strategists have held firm to forecasts for a ho-hum market this year following last year's 30 percent rally
            in the SP 500. The average projection on Jan. 3 called for a 5.8 percent gain to 1,955 in 2014, according to
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By April 1, the mean forecast had only moved up six points to 1,961. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's important to note in here that these oracles sort of missed the boat last year. The average
            estimate on Jan. 2, 2013, called for a 7.6 percent gain by the end of the year, while the SP 500 ended up
            jumping 30 percent to 1,848.36. Citigroup Inc.'s Tobias Levkovich was closest at 1,615, still more than 200
            points off. Kostin forecast a 2013 close of 1,575, almost 300 points off. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if Wall
            Street strategists were meteorologists, last year they called for a few inches of snow and the market ended
            up getting a blizzard. This year, they're calling for a dusting and so far they haven't been too far off --
            no accumulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>SEC Goldman Lawyer Says Agency Too Timid on Wall Street Misdeeds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A trial attorney from the Securities and Exchange Commission said his bosses were too 'tentative
            and fearful' to bring many Wall Street leaders to heel after the 2008 credit crisis, echoing the regulator's
            outside critics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James Kidney, who joined the SEC in 1986 and retired this month,
            offered the critique in a speech at his goodbye party. His remarks hit home with many in the crowd of SEC
            lawyers and alumni thanks to a part of his resume not publicly known: He had campaigned internally to bring
            charges against more executives in the agency's 2010 case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC has become 'an agency that polices the broken windows on the street level and rarely goes
            to the penthouse floors,' Kidney said, according to a copy of his remarks obtained by Bloomberg News. 'On
            the rare occasions when enforcement does go to the penthouse, good manners are paramount. Tough enforcement,
            risky enforcement, is subject to extensive negotiation and weakening.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kidney said his
            superiors were more focused on getting high-paying jobs after their government service than on bringing
            difficult cases. The agency's penalties, Kidney said, have become 'at most a tollbooth on the bankster
            turnpike.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Loses Bid to End Prudential Fraud Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
            win dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it engaged in fraud and
            racketeering in selling $375 million of residential mortgage-
            backed securities to Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark, New Jersey,
            ruled today that Prudential, the second-largest U.S. life
            insurer, sufficiently pleaded its claims that Goldman
            misrepresented its underwriting standards and practices. Goldman
            will have other opportunities to seek dismissal of the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prudential, based in Newark, bought securities from Goldman
            in 16 deals, according to Wigenton's opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, based in New York, asked the judge to dismiss the
            complaint, arguing that Prudential didn't adequately state its
            case for fraud and racketeering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wigenton disagreed, ruling that Prudential 'adequately
            pled a cause of action for fraud' and sufficiently stated its
            case that Goldman Sachs violated New Jersey's civil anti-
            racketeering statute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchases were made from February 2004 to December
            2008, according to the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parties have not yet engaged in the pretrial exchange
            of evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Scot
            Hoffman, a Prudential spokesman, declined to comment on the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also argued that New York law, not New Jersey
            law, applies to the fraud and RICO claims. Wigenton ruled that
            'determining a choice of law at this stage is premature'
            regarding fraud claims. She made a similar ruling with regard to
            the Goldman Sachs motion on the racketeering claim. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Prudential Insurance Co. v. Goldman Sachs
            Company, 2:12-cv-06590, U.S. District Court, District of New
            Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Dismissal of Capmark's Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) doesn't
            have to face Capmark Financial Group Inc.'s $147 million lawsuit
            claiming it was improperly influenced by the bank to refinance
            $1.5 billion in unsecured debt in a way that improved its
            position as a creditor, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in Manhattan yesterday
            ruled that Capmark, which sued Goldman in 2011, can't recover
            the money. Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Capmark claimed the sum
            was an insider preference paid to Goldman within a year of the
            Capmark bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sweet said Capmark can't claim the presence of a Goldman
            employee on its board means that the New York-based bank must
            return the $147 million because that argument contradicts its
            earlier position in the bankruptcy case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Plaintiffs represented to the Delaware bankruptcy court
            that the secured credit facility was negotiated at 'arm's
            length,'' Sweet said in a decision made public today.
            'Plaintiffs now assert a claim that requires the secured credit
            facility to have been a non-arms-length transaction.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
            General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September 2011, co-
            owned by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom fought in
            bankruptcy court with Goldman Sachs over the refinancing and the
            payments to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Capmark's Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capmark claimed that while the bank owned part of it in May
            2009, a group of Goldman Sachs units used their influence to
            persuade Capmark to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt
            owed the firm. The refinancing allowed Goldman Sachs to collect
            $147 million, including $7 million in cash, based on the new
            secured loan, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adam Shiff, a lawyer for Capmark, didn't immediately return
            a voice-mail message seeking comment on Sweet's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
            property values and a drop in lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. (CPMK) v. Goldman Sachs
            Credit Partners LP, 11-cv-07511, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yen at 130 to Dollar Isn't Unreasonable, Goldman's Beinner Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The yen weakening to 130 per dollar
            isn't an unreasonable prospect given the Bank of Japan's intent
            to beat deflation and double the nation's monetary base,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Jonathan Beinner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think this is a real change in policy and that it will
            be effective in weakening the yen,' Beinner, Goldman Sachs
            Asset Management's chief investment officer of global fixed
            income, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television's 'Market
            Makers' with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhl. The yen at 130
            'is not an unreasonable place to be. I'm not looking for that
            in the very near term. But that is a distinct possibility.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen last traded at 130 to the dollar in April 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The BOJ said April 4 it will double monthly bond buying to
            7.5 trillion yen ($76 billion), while suspending a cap on
            holdings and ending a three-year maturity limit on purchases.
            The government's goal of 2 percent inflation is achievable in
            two years, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters. Japan is
            struggling to pull out of its third recession in the past five
            years and 15 years of deflation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on Japan's 10-year government notes tumbled to a
            record low of 0.325 percent on April 5 before rebounding. The
            yen has dropped 6.8 percent since the BOJ decision, reaching
            99.77 per dollar, the weakest since April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 10-year note yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
            percentage point, to 0.58 percent in New York trading today,
            while the yen weakened 0.7 percent to 99.75 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Early Sign &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kyle Bass, whose Dallas-based hedge-fund firm Hayman
            Advisors LP made $500 million in 2007 betting against U.S.
            subprime mortgages, said on Bloomberg Television yesterday
            Japanese government bondholders' reaction, with yields sliding
            and rebounding, is an early sign of a market collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's Beinner also saw some concern for Japanese
            government bonds as the BOJ follows the Federal Reserve's
            strategy of buying bonds to stimulate the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The markets really went haywire,' Beinner said today.
            The Bank of Japan 'means what they say, that they want to get 2
            percent inflation. They are trying to out-Fed the Fed. You are
            seeing markets just not even know how to handle that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed has purchased more than $2.5 trillion of bonds
            since 2008 in its quantitative-easing strategy and is currently
            buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month.
            The central bank has kept its target rate for overnight loans
            between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Long-term Treasury yields are well below where models based
            on the pace of economic growth would project because of the
            amount of debt the Fed has purchased, raising the risk of a
            'bubble', Beinner said. Treasury 10-year notes yielded 1.78
            percent today, below the 10-year average of 3.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If there is a bubble, it's the government-bond market
            that's a bubble, not the credit market,' Beinner said. 'Even
            though the short-term interest rate is at zero, and obviously
            the economy is not booming, yet we think the existence of
            quantitative easing and huge purchase by the Fed at the long end
            has probably driven rates down 100 to 150 basis points more than
            they would be even given the current economic environment.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Reaches Deal to Drop Proposal for Separate Chairman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reached an
            agreement with an investor for the second straight year to drop
            a proposal from its annual meeting that called for an
            independent board chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank instead will give expanded
            responsibilities to its lead independent director, James Schiro,
            who will set the board's agenda and write his own letter to
            shareholders in the annual proxy statement, New York-based
            Goldman Sachs said. In exchange, shareholder CtW Investment
            Group will withdraw a proposal to split the roles of chief
            executive officer and chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've had a constructive engagement with our
            shareholders, and believe that the enhancements we have made
            further solidify the independence of the board,' David Wells, a
            Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal allows CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, who also has
            been chairman since he took control in 2006, to avoid a battle
            over dual roles that JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon, 57,
            faces. That bank's board urged investors to vote against naming
            a separate chairman at next month's shareholder meeting, saying
            Dimon's dual role remains the 'most effective leadership
            model.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 54, and Wells Fargo
            Co. (WFC)'s John Stumpf, 59, hold both the CEO and chairman titles.
            Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. have different people
            in the two roles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bank of America Hires Former Goldman Sachs Banker Luigi Rizzo</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the second-
            largest U.S. lender by assets, hired former Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc. banker Luigi Rizzo to become head of mergers and
            acquisitions for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rizzo, 42, will be based in London, when he joins in
            August, Adrian Mee, head of international mergers and
            acquisitions, said in a memo to employees today. The contents of
            the memo were confirmed by a spokeswoman for the bank in London.
            Philip Noblet, who co-runs the European advisory business, was
            appointed chairman of the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These two appointments are important steps and represent
            further investment in our strategically important global MA
            business,' Mee said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America's investment bank, overseen by the firm's
            Co-Chief Operating Officer Thomas K. Montag, has been seeking
            selective hires after freeing payroll by cutting more than 30
            employees, said a person with knowledge of the strategy in
            March. It has also been overhauling and adding to its
            investment-banking team in Europe following the exits of Andrea Orcel as chairman of global banking and
            markets and Jonathan Moulds, the firm's president of Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank last year hired Alex Wilmot-Sitwell from UBS AG (UBSN) as
            president of its European division and Diego De Giorgi, chief
            operating officer of Goldman Sachs's investment-banking
            division, as joint head of global corporate and investment
            banking for Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Cuts Gold Price Forecast Through 2014 as Cycle Turns</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The turn in the gold price cycle is accelerating after a 12-year rally as the recovery in the U.S.
            economy gains momentum, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which reduced forecasts for the metal through
            2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank cut its three-month target to $1,530 an ounce from $1,615 and lowered the
            six- and 12-month predictions to $1,490 and $1,390 from $1,600 and $1,550. Goldman recommended closing a
            long Comex gold position initiated on Oct. 11, 2010 for a potential gain of $219 an ounce, analysts Damien
            Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold dropped 5.8 percent this year
            on speculation that the Federal Reserve may pare its stimulus amid an economic recovery. The gold price is
            in bubble territory, Societe Generale SA said in an April 2 report. Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the
            biggest exchange-traded fund backed by bullion, declined to about 1,200 metric tons yesterday, the least
            since June 2011. Deutsche Bank AG cut its 2013 gold outlook yesterday by 12 percent, citing a strengthening
            dollar and a lack of haven buying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Despite resurgence in euro-area risk aversion and
            disappointing U.S. economic data, gold prices are unchanged over the past month, highlighting how conviction
            in holding gold is quickly waning,' the Goldman analysts wrote in the report. 'While higher inflation may be
            the catalyst for the next gold cycle, this is likely several years away.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gold for June
            delivery on the Comex in New York fell 0.5 percent to $1,579.30 an ounce as of 8:52 a.m. local time. The
            metal advanced 1.1 percent in March, the first monthly gain since September, as policy makers wrangled over
            Cyprus's 10 billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Targets Cut &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            cut its 2013 gold estimate to $1,545 an ounce from $1,610, trimmed its 2014 forecast to $1,350 from $1,490,
            and set year-end targets of $1,450 in 2013 and $1,270 in 2014. Goldman recommended starting a short Comex
            gold position, targeting $1,450 with a stop at $1,650, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Futures
            averaged a record $1,671 last year and the 12 straight annual gains in London were the best run in at least
            nine decades. Bullion will fall to $1,375 by the end of the year as a U.S. recovery leads to rising interest
            rates, Societe Generale said in the April 2 report. Credit Suisse Group AG cut its 2013 estimate by 9.2
            percent to $1,580 a day later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse, Societe Generale, Danske
            Bank A/S (DANSKE) and BNP Paribas SA are among banks predicting lower average prices in 2014 than this year.
            While Deutsche Bank lowered its 2013 gold forecast to $1,637 yesterday, it still expects prices to average
            $1,810 next year. Bullion futures climbed to an all- time high of $1,923.70 in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETP Holdings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holdings in exchange-traded products have shrunk 7.6 percent
            this year, compared with gains in silver, platinum and palladium, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They were
            2,432.3 tons yesterday, compared with an all-time high of 2,632.5 tons in December. Speculators held a
            net-long gold position of 47,164 contracts in the week ended April 2, down 76 percent from October, U.S.
            Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We believe a sharp rebound in gold
            prices is unlikely,' Goldman said. 'The fall in prices could end up being faster and larger than our
            forecast, as aggregate speculative net long positions across Comex futures and gold ETFs remain near record
            highs.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Koch, Goldman Agree to Buy Printing-Ink Maker Flint From CVC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Koch Industries Inc. and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s (GS) private-equity unit agreed to buy Flint Group
            from CVC Capital Partners Ltd. to add chemicals and additives
            used in the printing and packaging industries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction, which adds 137 sites, is expected to be
            completed in the second half, the companies said today in a
            statement, without giving financial terms. Flint, based in
            Luxembourg, generates annual sales of about 2.2 billion euros
            ($3 billion). The asset fetched just over 2 billion euros,
            according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined
            to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision by Koch and Goldman Sachs to invest in the
            business coincides with growing demand for packaging and
            increased demand for newspapers in emerging markets. Flint,
            along with DuPont Co. (DD) and MacDermid Group Inc., have been
            gaining ground with flexographic printing plate technology for
            packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Flint is uniquely positioned to capture growth in its
            attractive printed packaging markets while at the same time
            continuing to benefit from strong and resilient performance of
            its print media business,' said Matthias Hieber, head of
            corporate equity investing for German-speaking operations at
            Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking Division, in the statement.
            'With a significantly improved capital structure, Flint is best
            positioned to pursue its ambitious growth plans.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale marks the end of a years-long attempt by CVC to
            exit Flint which became a market leader in the printing and
            packaging additive industry via acquisitions. CVC shelved an
            initial public offering in 2010 and abandoned another exit
            attempt in 2012 after private-equity firms withdrew from a
            bidding process, people close to the talks said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greenhill Co. advised CVC and Flint in the transaction
            with Koch and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Management &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CVC built the asset from two European ink companies bought
            in 2004 from BASF SE and Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) and merged with Flint Ink
            Corp. in the U.S. a year later to form the enlarged group. The
            private equity company installed new management, appointing Akzo
            Nobel executive Antoine Fady as chief executive in 2011, and
            Steve Dryden as finance head last year from U.K. packaging
            company DS Smith Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Koch, the purchase ties in with its ownership of
            Georgia-Pacific LLC, which brings insight into the needs of
            packaging makers. Koch, led by billionaire brothers Charles and
            David Koch, is one of the largest closely held companies in the
            U.S., with interests ranging from energy to fertilizers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says China Junk Debt Not Paying Enough for Default Risk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in high-yield bonds from
            China, the majority of which come from the real estate industry,
            aren't being paid enough for assuming the risk of economic
            slowdown and defaults, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For China high yield, we do not think there is sufficient
            premium to compensate for these risks, especially given the
            potentially high correlation risks in the real estate sector,'
            analysts at the New York investment bank including Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a report today.
            'There is better
            value in investment grade.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar bonds from issuers in China returned 2.24 percent
            since Dec. 31, tied with South Korea for third-worst performer
            in 15 Asian markets tracked by JPMorgan Chase Co. The
            country's policy makers have set a 7.5 percent growth target for
            this year, which would be the slowest expansion since 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exports and imports unexpectedly fell in March,
            underscoring the depth of China's slowdown. Overseas shipments
            declined 6.6 percent from a year earlier, the customs
            administration said in Beijing today, attributing the drop
            partly to distortions from inflated data in early 2013. Imports
            fell 11.3 percent, leaving a trade surplus of $7.71 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Concern about non-payment in the real estate industry is
            mounting after Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co., a builder in a
            city south of Shanghai, collapsed with 3.5 billion yuan ($564
            million) in liabilities last month. The nation's credit default
            swaps rose to 87 basis points on April 9 from as low as 64 in
            November, after Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science
            Technology Co. on March 7 became the first company to default on
            corporate bonds in its home market. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Gives Blankfein $5 Million Long-Term Incentive</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein a $5 million cash
            bonus to be paid out in three years if he meets certain targets, on top of $21 million in 2012 compensation.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The long-term incentive was $3 million last year and $7 million in 2011 when the program
            began, the New York-based bank said today in a filing. The awards can shrink or grow depending on whether
            the firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7 percent average increase in book value per
            share. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, which already gives a portion of top
            executives' pay in restricted stock, have been seeking ways to encourage managers to focus on long-term
            performance. Goldman Sachs's plan gives the board's compensation committee, led by former Fannie Mae CEO
            James A. Johnson, the power to change the awards to so-called named executive officers, or NEOs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion based on its assessment of an
            individual NEO's performance, adjust the amounts that may be paid under this award,' according to the
            filing, which says the committee can give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            firm also granted President Gary D. Cohn a $5 million long-term award this year. Vice Chairmen J. Michael
            Evans and John S. Weinberg got $4 million incentives. Last year, all of the firm's executives named in the
            proxy received $3 million in long-term incentives, down from $7 million for all of the executives in 2011.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Viniar's Exception &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially
            tied to three-year periods, the board can opt to extend the measurement for another five years. In December,
            the compensation committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay to end in December 2018
            instead of December 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One exception is for David A. Viniar, who retired as chief
            financial officer at the end of January. He will receive any 2011 incentive pay in January 2014 and any 2012
            long-term grant in January 2015, according to today's proxy filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The board's ability
            to change the long-term incentive measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any individual it
            singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an
            executive a better chance at getting the money,' said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of
            Michigan's law school and business school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's top executives also received
            payouts from funds managed by the firm during the year, including profits, return of money invested, and
            their portion of the funds' management fees, known as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2
            million for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar, $21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6
            million for Weinberg, according to the proxy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other recipients of such fund
            distributions included Vice Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel Gregory K.
            Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy showed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Leads $25 Million Financing in Startup Motif</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Motif Investing Inc., a Web-based
            startup that lets investors buy baskets of stocks based on
            themes like home improvement and Obamacare, raised $25 million
            in a financing round led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Darren Cohen, who leads Goldman's principal strategic
            investments group, is joining Motif's board as an observer, the
            San Mateo, California-based company said today in a statement.
            Existing investors Foundation Capital, Ignition Partners and
            Norwest Venture Partners contributed to the round. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2010, Motif is among an increasing number of
            startups offering online products for investors that are
            designed to lower the cost of trading while avoiding high-
            priced, poor-performing mutual funds. Jemstep Inc. and
            FutureAdvisor provide asset-allocation advice and help clients
            easily make the recommended trades, while Wealthfront Inc.
            manages money online by investing in low-fee index funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This space is heating up,' Hardeep Walia, 40, Motif's
            chief executive officer, said in an interview. 'If you think
            about what we've done in Silicon Valley, we've disrupted so many
            businesses, but no one's traditionally had luck in financial
            services.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motif offers custom-made and user-generated funds of up to
            30 stocks for about $10. To date, the company has focused on
            providing retail investors an alternative to exchange-traded
            funds sold by companies like E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) and Charles
            Schwab Corp. (SCHW) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investment Savings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the additional financing, Motif is rolling out the
            software to investment advisors, giving them products to offer
            clients without management fees attached. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For example, brokers could sell a fund created by Motif,
            use one created by someone else that's available on the site or
            establish their own by copying what's in a particular mutual
            fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That allows them to save the 2 to 3 percent fees they're
            paying every year to mutual-fund companies,' Walia said. 'They
            can either take that as a reward for their business or pass the
            savings along to customers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motif has 40 employees, including several early executives
            from E*Trade. The company has patent-pending technology that
            lowers the cost of volume trading, letting it make 'good
            margins' at $10 a trade, Walia said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Obamacare, Housing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Obamacare motif includes shares of hospitals like HCA
            Holdings Inc. (HCA), electronic medical-records providers such as
            Cerner Corp. (CERN) and generic-drug maker Actavis Inc. (ACT) The fund is
            designed for investors looking to benefit from the Affordable
            Care Act, which may extend coverage to 30 million previously
            uninsured Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's also a motif called Ivy League that follows the
            investment strategy of David Swensen, chief investment officer
            at Yale University. Other motifs focus on biotechnology
            breakthroughs, the natural-gas glut and the housing recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs group leading the investment is part of
            the bank's securities division and backs financial-technology
            startups and market structure-related companies. Previous
            investments include the London Metal Exchange and Broadway
            Technology LLC, a provider of electronic-trading systems. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In today's release, Cohen of Goldman Sachs said Motif 'has
            taken an innovative approach to traditional investing.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Pays Cohn More Than Evans in First Gap Since 2007</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyd C. Blankfein's top deputies
            are no longer equal in terms of pay at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
            compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, according to
            the New York-
            based firm's annual proxy filing. The disparity is the first
            since 2007, when Blankfein's bonus set the record for a Wall
            Street chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The change may further fuel speculation about which
            executive is most likely to succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes
            out-earned his own boss Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded
            Paulson as Goldman Sachs chairman and CEO in June 2006, said in
            a February interview with Bloomberg Television that he has plans
            to stay in the top job indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If somebody gets more money that could be a sign' that
            they're in the running for the job eventually, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global
            Executive Search
            in New York. 'A partnership is very big about 'what message are
            we giving each partner?'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees Goldman Sachs's
            emerging-markets business, received $17 million, as did
            Weinberg, 56, who helps oversee investment banking. David Viniar, who retired as the firm's chief financial
            officer
            earlier this year, was awarded $19 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn's package for 2012 included a $5.15 million cash
            bonus. Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55 million cash award. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Performance, Roles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
            NEOs, were 'primarily to reflect their individual performance,
            as well as their roles,' the bank said in the filing. 'No
            specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
            in making these NEO compensation determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein received a larger bonus than his deputies for the
            first time since 2007, when he set a Wall Street pay record. All
            of Goldman Sachs's named executives received no bonus in 2008,
            and then got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million
            and $10 million over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein got $21 million for last year, his highest annual
            package since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January.
            That consisted of $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7
            million cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million
            salary, according to today's filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
            largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
            Stanley (MS)'s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Overcoming Opposition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
            reported its first revenue gain in three years in 2012, as each
            of its four divisions showed an increase last year. The bank's
            return on equity was 10.7 percent, up from 3.7 percent in 2011
            while less than one-third of what the firm earned in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
            increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
            16 percent this year, they're still 12 percent below their level
            at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's compensation committee has been led by
            James A. Johnson, a former CEO of Fannie Mae, as long as the
            bank has been a public company. Johnson was re-elected to the
            board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year's
            shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
            Ruane, Cunniff Goldfarb Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut 900 jobs last year, and compensation
            costs rose 6 percent, trailing the 19 percent increase in
            revenue. In November, the firm named 70 employees to its so-
            called partnership, the fewest in 13 years as a public company,
            and said last month that it will start naming managing directors
            every two years instead of annually. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Cohn Takes Pay Lead Among CEO's Deputies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
            fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has started differentiating
            among Lloyd C. Blankfein's top deputies again after four years
            of granting lockstep pay awards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Gary Cohn, 52, was awarded a $19 million
            compensation package, 12 percent more than Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg, the New
            York-based firm said
            in an annual proxy. The disparity is the first since 2007, when
            Blankfein's bonus set the record for a Wall Street chief
            executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn's pay may fuel speculation about which executive will
            succeed Blankfein, 58, who sometimes out-earned his own boss
            Henry Paulson. Blankfein, who succeeded Paulson as chairman and
            CEO in June 2006, said in a February interview with Bloomberg
            Television that he has no immediate plans to depart. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If somebody gets more money, that could be a sign' that
            they're in the lead to succeed Blankfein, said Jeanne Branthover, managing director at Boyden Global
            Executive Search
            in New York. 'If somebody gets less money it's not a good
            thing, because they've been equals.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, 55, the vice chairman who oversees the emerging-
            markets business, received $17 million, as did Weinberg, 56, a
            co-head of investment banking. David A. Viniar, chief financial
            officer until the end of January, was awarded $19 million. The
            firm didn't disclose 2012 pay for Harvey M. Schwartz, who
            replaced Viniar as CFO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Individual Performance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Differences in pay among the named executive officers, or
            NEOs, were 'primarily to reflect their individual performance,
            as well as their roles,' the bank said in the filing. 'No
            specific individual performance goals were used by the committee
            in making these NEO compensation determinations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, also received a larger bonus than his
            deputies for the first time since 2007. None of Goldman Sachs's
            named executives was awarded a bonus for 2008, and each of them
            got cash and stock awards of $9 million, $18 million and $10
            million over the next three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's $21 million award for 2012 was his highest
            since 2007, as reported by Bloomberg News in January. It
            included $13.3 million in restricted stock and a $5.7 million
            cash bonus for 2012 in addition to his $2 million salary,
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That made him the highest-paid CEO among those at the 10
            largest U.S. banks, exceeding the $9.75 million for Morgan
            Stanley (MS)'s James Gorman and $11.5 million awarded to JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM)'s Jamie Dimon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cash Bonuses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn's and Viniar's packages for 2012 each included a $5.15
            million cash bonus, while Evans and Weinberg each got a $4.55
            million cash award. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pay is higher for all executives if long-term incentive
            plan awards are included. The plan will pay $5 million in cash
            bonuses to Blankfein and Cohn, and $4 million to Evans and
            Weinberg in three years if the firm meets certain targets. The
            same rules apply to last year's $3 million long-term incentive
            and $7 million in 2011, when the plan started. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cash bonuses shrink or grow depending on whether the
            firm achieves a 10 percent average return on equity and 7
            percent average increase in book value per share. The board's
            compensation committee, which has been led by former Fannie Mae
            CEO James A. Johnson as long as Goldman Sachs has been a public
            company, has the power to change the awards. The committee can
            give from zero to 150 percent of the amount due, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Goldman Sachs awards are initially tied to three-
            year periods, the board can also opt to extend the measurement
            for a further five years. In December, the compensation
            committee set the performance period for the 2011 incentive pay
            to end in December 2018 instead of December 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Getting Money &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The board's ability to change the long-term incentive
            measures whenever it wants to, and with respect to any
            individual it singles out, makes the plan a joke because you can
            be sure the adjustments that are made will be to give an
            executive a better chance at getting the money,' said Erik
            Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school
            and business school. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top executives received payouts from funds managed by the
            firm during the year, including profits, return of money
            invested, and their portion of the funds' management fees, known
            as overrides. Those payouts during 2012 totaled $31.2 million
            for Blankfein, $25.8 million for Cohn, $22.2 million for Viniar,
            $21.3 million for Evans, and $9.6 million for Weinberg,
            according to the proxy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other recipients of such fund distributions included Vice
            Chairman Michael S. Sherwood with $18.7 million; General Counsel
            Gregory K. Palm, with $29.7 million; and Chief of Staff John F. W. Rogers, with $9.9 million, the proxy
            showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Results Improve &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported its first revenue gain in three
            years in 2012. Return on equity, a measure of how well the bank
            reinvests shareholders' money, rose to 10.7 percent from 3.7
            percent in 2011. Still, it remained at less than one-third of
            its 2007 level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 41 percent in 2012, the first annual
            increase since doubling in 2009. While the shares have rallied
            17 percent this year to close yesterday at $149.12, they're
            still 11 percent below their level at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Johnson, head of the compensation committee, was re-elected
            to the board with about 84 percent of the vote at last year's
            shareholder meeting, overcoming opposition from investment firm
            Ruane, Cunniff Goldfarb Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's board altered succession planning for top
            executives, which it used for Schwartz's ascension to CFO, lead
            director James Schiro wrote in his inaugural letter to
            shareholders. The new framework is focused on making sure
            potential candidates have experience with the board and with
            many of the firm's businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our goal is always to be in a position to appoint our
            most senior executives from within our firm,' the board said in
            the annual proxy statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sole Korea Rate-Cut Call Reviewed at ING as Goldman Changes View</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ING Groep NV is the only bank left
            predicting a 2014 interest-rate cut in South Korea. There may be
            none soon as the call is reviewed after a Bank of Korea meeting
            that prompted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to pull its forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank kept its benchmark rate at 2.5 percent at
            an April 10 policy meeting and Governor Lee Ju Yeol said the
            decision was unanimous. A recent slowdown in inflation was
            mostly due to temporary factors and the monetary authority may
            consider raising borrowing costs as price pressures build, Lee
            told a press briefing that day. The bank lifted its 2014
            economic growth estimate to 4 percent from 3.8 percent, and cut
            its inflation projection to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea's bonds have handed investors the second-lowest
            returns in Asia excluding Japan this year, beating only the
            Philippines, and the outlook for the securities may dim as rate-cut predictions are axed. Goldman described
            Lee's tone as
            'hawkish' and said April 10 it was no longer expecting a 25
            basis point reduction in the benchmark rate this year. Of 26
            economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 13 forecast the rate will be
            raised at least once in 2014, while ING still sees a 25 basis
            point cut in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are reviewing our current forecast for a possible
            change,' Prakash Sakpal, a Singapore-based strategist for ING
            Bank, said in an April 11 interview. 'Governor Lee's comments
            after the policy meeting indicated the possible next move in the
            benchmark rate would be up.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Swap Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should pay South Korea's 10-year interest-rate
            swap to 'position for expectations of higher rates,' Ashish Agrawal, a Singapore-based analyst at Credit
            Suisse Group AG,
            wrote in an April 11 research note. The contracts, which
            exchange fixed payments for the three-month certificate of
            deposit rate, fell six basis points last week to 3.29 percent in
            Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The three-month
            rate was steady at 2.65 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week's Bank of Korea meeting was the first since
            Governor Lee Ju Yeol replaced previous chief Kim Choong Soo
            whose term ended March 31. Lee has 35 years' experience at the
            central bank, which he left in April 2012 when a three-year term
            as senior deputy governor ended. The latest announcements showed
            the monetary authority sees inflation as a bigger risk than an
            economic slowdown, Kwon Goohoon, Seoul-based economist for
            Goldman Sachs, wrote in an April 10 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Hawkish Stance' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The press conference confirmed Lee's hawkish stance,'
            Hwangbo Youngok, a Seoul-based director for Korea Investment
            Securities Co., one of the nation's 21 bond primary dealers,
            said in an April 11 interview. 'Still, the actual rate increase
            will only happen after data matches Bank of Korea's
            expectations.' Hwangbo predicts borrowing costs will be left
            unchanged this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer-price gains quickened to 1.3 percent in March from
            February's 1 percent, while remaining below the central bank's
            target band of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Export (KOEXTOTY) growth
            accelerated to 5.2 percent from 1.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Park Geun Hye unveiled in February a three-year
            plan to boost the country's growth potential through
            deregulation and innovation. That signaled authorities seek to
            support the economy through broader reforms instead of monetary
            policy adjustments, according to ING's Sakpal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on South Korea's 10-year government debt fell
            five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, this year to 3.53
            percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. South Korea's won
            appreciated 1.9 percent to 1,035.35 per dollar, touching
            1,031.55 on April 10, the highest since August 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rate Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 10-year yield, which climbed 43 basis points in 2013,
            will rise to 3.9 percent by year-end, according to a Bloomberg
            survey of analysts. That would mark the first back-to-back
            annual increases in Bloomberg data going back to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc recommends entering one-year interest-rate
            swaps to position for an increase in borrowing costs. The
            contracts declined two basis points this year to 2.69 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Expectations for rate increases aren't reflected in the
            interest-rate market yet as the market is still unsure of the
            timing of monetary-policy normalization,' Rohit Arora, a
            Singapore-based strategist at Barclays, said April 11. 'We
            expect the Bank of Korea to begin normalizing rates in the third
            quarter, and see room for one-year interest rate swaps to rise
            40 basis points in the next six months.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bond yields haven't yet risen on bets of potential policy
            tightening by the central bank because ample cash supply in the
            financial system is fueling demand, according to Moon Hong Cheol, a fixed-income analyst at Dongbu
            Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors still unsure of an economic recovery are
            parking money in money-market funds and cash-management
            accounts,' which buy short-term bonds, Seoul-based Moon said.
            'We see continued demand for mid- to long-term sovereign debt
            from insurers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount managed by money-market funds and cash-management accounts rose to 76.5 trillion won
            ($74 billion) as
            of March 31 from 68.7 trillion won at the end of 2013, according
            to central bank data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Client Trade Lawsuits Over Singapore Stock Rout</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Lynne Ng Su Ling, an independent director at LionGold Corp.,
            traded
            lawsuits in London over payment demands after shares owned by Ng
            and held by the bank as debt collateral plunged in an October
            stock rout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs units are seeking $17.5 million from Ng,
            money the bank says she owes after it sold her shares, according
            to a countersuit by the bank filed March 24 and made available
            over the weekend. In a complaint served on Goldman Sachs in
            February, Ng says the bank failed to use reasonable efforts to
            get the best price available when it sold her stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ng's portfolio with Goldman Sachs totaled S$113 million
            ($90 million) including shares in Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP), Blumont
            Group Ltd. (BLUM) and LionGold, as of Sept. 30, according to court
            papers. She is the third client Goldman has sued over unpaid
            debts related to a stock crash over three days in October that
            wiped $6.9 billion off the market value of LionGold, Blumont
            Group Ltd. and Asiasons Capital Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sudden declines prompted the city's central bank and
            white-collar crime agency to probe suspected stock-trading
            irregularities around the tumble. Banks and brokers are seeking
            to recover at least $230 million from the stock rout. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nickel Extends Longest Rally in 42 Months After Goldman Forecast</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel prices rose, extending the
            longest rally in 42 months, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
            price is poised climb an additional 12 percent because of
            limited supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On the London Metal Exchange, nickel for delivery in three
            months jumped 2.2 percent to settle at $17,790 a metric ton at
            5:53 p.m. Earlier, the price reached $17,917, the highest since
            Feb. 19, 2013. The commodity climbed for the 11th straight
            session, the longest advance since Oct. 6, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The price may climb as high as $20,000 a ton, Goldman said
            in a report dated yesterday. Nickel gained 28 percent this year
            after Indonesia, the world's top producer from mines, barred
            exports of raw mineral ores in January. Russia, home to OAO GMK
            Norilsk Nickel, the leading producer of refined metal, might
            face more sanctions from the U.S. and Europe amid turmoil in
            Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been bullish on nickel since the start of the
            year, but prices have risen more quickly than in our base
            case,' Jeff Currie, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in the
            report. 'The price rally predominantly reflects the ongoing
            Indonesian ore export ban' and 'concerns about the potential
            impact of any sanctions on Russian commodity exports.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. raised its 2015 estimate by 13 percent to
            $21,500 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shortfall Looms &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the market expects inventories in China, the largest
            consumer, to last from eight to 12 months after the export ban,
            most of those supplies are concentrated in the hands of the
            larger nickel pig-iron producers, and smaller ones may begin to
            run out of higher-grade Indonesian-sourced ore as soon as the
            end of this month, Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel open interest rose to a record 297,642 contracts as
            of April 10. In March, the contracts outstanding jumped 18
            percent, the most since September 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market 'remains in an artificially induced squeeze,
            one that could propel prices even higher from current levels,'
            Edward Meir, an analyst at INTL FCStone Inc. in New York, said
            today in a report. The tension between Russia and Ukraine
            'continues to merit increased attention, as it has the
            potential to destabilize the markets, should it spiral out of
            control,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zinc, lead and tin gained in London, while aluminum and
            copper dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On the Comex in New York, copper futures for May delivery
            rose 0.2 percent to $3.0475 a pound. Stockpiles monitored by the
            LME dropped for the 13th straight session to the lowest since
            November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Stands by $1,050 Gold Target on Outlook for Recovery</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gold will resume a decline as U.S.
            economic growth accelerates, according to Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc., which reiterated a forecast for the metal to end the year
            at $1,050 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion's rally this year was spurred by poor U.S. data
            probably linked to the weather and rising tension in Ukraine,
            analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report, describing the
            reasons as transient. With the tapering of the Federal Reserve's
            bond-buying program, U.S. economic releases will return as the
            driving force behind lower prices, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold's 12-year bull run ended in 2013 as the Fed prepared
            to reduce monthly bond-buying that fueled gains in asset prices
            while failing to stoke inflation. Prices rose 10 percent this
            year even as the Fed cut purchases, with Russia's annexation of
            Crimea and mixed U.S. economic data boosting haven demand. Last
            year, Currie described gold as a 'slam-dunk sell' for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would require a significant sustained slowdown in U.S.
            growth for us to revisit our expectation for lower gold prices
            over the next two years,' Currie wrote in the report, dated
            yesterday. 'While further escalation in tensions could support
            gold prices, we expect a sequential acceleration in both U.S.
            and Chinese activity, and hence for gold prices to decline.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold for immediate delivery traded 0.3 percent higher at
            $1,322.01 an ounce at 7:43 p.m. in Singapore, according to
            Bloomberg generic pricing, after the United Nations Security
            Council met to address the Ukraine crisis. Bullion last traded
            below $1,050 an ounce in February 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Morgan Stanley &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion is the least preferred commodity among metals as
            prices resume a decline this year on the outlook for rising U.S.
            interest rates and low inflation expectations, Morgan Stanley
            said in a report on April 8. Average prices are expected to drop
            for the next four quarters, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stronger U.S. growth this year and next will help the world
            economy withstand weaker recoveries in emerging markets,
            according to the International Monetary Fund. The world's
            largest economy will expand 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent
            in 2015, unchanged from forecasts in January, the IMF said in
            its World Economic Outlook report last week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Russian Energy-Export Sanctions Are Unlikely</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Western nations probably won't
            impose energy export-related sanctions on Russia amid escalating
            tensions in Ukraine as Europe has little alternative to Russian
            gas, according to Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Europe could displace Russian gas imports for eight weeks
            before prices need to rise to attract supplies of liquefied
            fuel, Goldman analysts led by Jeff Currie in London said in an
            e-mailed report dated yesterday. Spare capacity available on the
            Nordstream pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea
            wouldn't cover lost volumes if Ukraine transit was disrupted,
            Citigroup said in a separate report dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia, the world's biggest energy exporter, called for an
            emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after
            Ukrainian security forces clashed with pro-Russian gunmen in the
            eastern town of Slovyansk. Ukraine is key to Europe's energy
            security because pipelines crossing the country carry Russian
            gas making up about 15 percent of the region's supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the worst-case scenario where energy flows are
            disrupted, we would expect the European natural gas market to
            tighten significantly,' Goldman said. 'The global crude oil
            market becomes better supplied with U.S. and OPEC ramping up
            production on top of ample reserves today, suggesting a
            deflationary rather than inflationary impact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Camouflaged gunmen fired on Ukrainian government forces
            near Slovyansk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) from the
            Russian frontier, Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said.
            'Henchmen' of the government in Kiev are organizing attacks
            with the backing of Western nations, Russia's Ambassador to the
            United Nations Vitaly Churkin said at an emergency session of
            the Security Council in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gas Storage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. natural gas futures extended their biggest weekly gain
            since 2011, paring their decline for the year to 23 percent
            after the mildest winter in seven years cut demand and left
            inventories brimming. Prices have been 'relatively
            unresponsive' to the tensions between Russia and Ukraine and
            significant disruptions in Russian gas supply to Europe are
            unlikely, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gas stockpiles in Europe were 48.1 percent full yesterday,
            compared with 20 percent at the same time last year, according
            to data on the website of Gas Infrastructure Europe, a Brussels-based lobby group. Contracted supplies have
            continued to flow
            'healthily' to western Europe from its two main suppliers,
            Russia's gas-pipeline monopoly OAO Gazprom and Norway's Statoil
            ASA, according to Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Revenue Source &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A stoppage of Russian oil and gas flows to/via Ukraine or
            to Europe as a whole could be hugely impactful for oil and gas
            prices, especially if it is long-lasting,' said Citigroup
            analysts including Edward Morse. 'A disruption of gas flows in
            the short run would be muted by current high storage in Europe
            due to the recent mild winter and the upcoming seasonal slowdown
            in demand.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gas exports to Europe are 'an important source' of
            revenue for Russia, making reductions unlikely, according to
            Goldman Sachs. While Ukraine's refusal to accept Russian gas
            until prices are discounted has raised the risk of cut-offs, a
            resolution is expected 'in the near term' given the
            consequences it could have for all parties, Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European gas prices may need to fall further to boost usage
            in the power sector at the expense of coal, which could start to
            happen when prices fall below 45 pence a therm ($7.53 a million
            British thermal units), according to Citigroup. Front-month gas
            on the National Balancing Point hub rose 2.1 percent to 53.2
            pence a therm at 12:41 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe that U.K. NBP prices are not likely to be
            unduly pressured,' Goldman said. 'We still expect northwest
            European gas markets to remain well supplied this year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While a switch to gas may happen this summer, winter gas
            prices will make burning coal more advantageous, Citigroup said,
            forecasting U.K. prices at 56 pence a therm this year and 55
            pence in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Commodities Seen by Goldman Down After 'Transient Events'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects
            commodity prices to decline this year even after precious metals
            and crop prices rallied on Ukraine tension and weather concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index may drop 4 percent in
            the next 12 months from a 4.3 percent decrease predicted in
            February, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated
            yesterday. Precious metals will decline 15 percent, compared
            with a 14 percent retreat forecast in February, it said.
            Agriculture prices will drop 10 percent, from February's
            estimate of a 9 percent loss, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold rose 10 percent in 2014, rebounding from the biggest
            drop since 1981, as unrest in Ukraine and concerns the global
            recovery may be uneven boosted demand for a haven. Tensions in
            Ukraine also contributed to corn's 20 percent jump this year on
            speculation supply may be disrupted and dry weather in the U.S.
            pushed wheat 12 percent higher. The six-month rolling
            correlation of commodities and equities returns has averaged 23
            percent this year, the lowest since 2008, Goldman says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Since the beginning of the year, transient events
            including cold weather, Chinese credit concerns and tensions in
            Crimea have driven commodity prices,' Goldman said. 'Although
            these drivers are transient in nature, they are idiosyncratic,
            which has helped to drive down the correlations not only with
            other asset classes but also within the commodity space itself,
            reinforcing the diversifying component of the strategic
            investment case for commodities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gold Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion's recent rally was spurred by poor U.S. data
            probably linked to the weather and rising tension in Ukraine,
            Goldman said, maintaining a year-end forecast of $1,050 an
            ounce. With the tapering of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying
            program, U.S. economic releases will return as the driving force
            behind lower prices, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn will drop to $4 a bushel in 12 months on expectations
            U.S. plantings will be higher than the U.S. Department of
            Agriculture forecasts, increasing stockpiles, Goldman said.
            Wheat will decline to $5.75 a bushel on production prospects in
            Europe and the Black Sea, and normalization of U.S. rains, it
            said. Soybeans may drop to $10.50 a bushel on record South
            American output, slowing Chinese imports and as U.S. acreage
            reaches an all-time high, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel may climb to as much as $20,000 a metric ton should
            Indonesia's ore export ban remain in place after its July
            presidential election, according to Goldman. Prices in London
            surged 28 percent this year as Indonesia, the largest miner of
            nickel, curbed ore exports to spur local processing. Copper will
            drop to $6,200 a ton over the next 12 months, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Energy prices are set to decline 2.5 percent in the next 12
            months, from a 3.5 percent drop forecast in February, Goldman
            said today. Livestock will retreat 2 percent, from a February
            forecast of unchanged prices, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blackstone, Goldman Said to Buy Ipreo From KKR for $975M</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world's
            biggest private-equity firm, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
            merchant banking unit agreed to buy financial data provider
            Ipreo Holdings LLC from KKR Co. (KKR) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction values New York-based Ipreo at $975
            million, according to a person with knowledge of the deal, who
            requested anonymity because financial terms weren't announced.
            KKR will keep a minority stake in the company, according to a
            statement today from the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Together with KKR, we have grown significantly and
            solidified our leadership in capital markets software, and data
            and analytics services,' Scott Ganeles, Ipreo's chief executive
            officer, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR, the private-equity firm led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, bought Ipreo in 2011 from
            investment firm Veronis
            Suhler Stevenson LLC. Kristi Huller, a KKR spokeswoman, declined
            to comment on the company's value. Christine Anderson, a
            spokeswoman for Blackstone, didn't immediately respond to a
            request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP competes with Ipreo in providing initial
            public offering data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Profits as Abe Spurs Convertible Debt Boom: Japan Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) helped
            regional Japanese banks sell the most dollar-denominated
            convertible debt since at least 1999, as the lenders took
            advantage of a stock-market rally to fund overseas expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest underwriter of the notes helped to
            arrange three of the firms' five U.S. currency sales in the last
            12 months. It co-managed deals by Yamagata Bank Ltd., Bank of
            Iwate Ltd. and Shizuoka Bank Ltd., whose convertible offering
            last April was the first by a Japanese company since 2002,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman had only
            underwritten seven Japanese convertible-note sales in the decade
            prior to 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Convertible bonds have established themselves as one
            funding tool, so all regional lenders have no choice but to
            consider them to some extent,' Hiroyuki Sugiura, a vice
            president at Goldman's investment banking division at the
            company's Japanese unit in Tokyo said in an April 11 interview.
            They offer the regional lenders cheaper funding, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abe's stimulus program to overcome 15 years of deflation
            has spurred a stock market recovery that has allowed banks to
            get favorable terms on their convertibles, with the three
            lenders all selling zero-coupon notes. The regional institutions
            will use the funds to lend to clients expanding overseas as a
            shrinking domestic population curtails growth prospects at home. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Quickest Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs underwrote $330 million of the $1.3 billion
            of dollar convertible bonds sold by regional banks over the past
            12 months, a figure exceeded only by Nomura Holdings Inc. Morgan
            Stanley, the next biggest overseas manager, managed $120
            million, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Nomura, Japan's largest
            brokerage, arranged $585 million in debt, including an issuance
            by Yamaguchi Financial Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman was the quickest in bringing us a proposal,'
            Katsunori Nakanishi, the president of Shizuoka Bank, said
            yesterday in an interview. 'After looking at the success of our
            deal, it became easier for other regional banks to follow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of convertible notes, which combine a fixed-income
            security with an option to buy stock, have surged since Abe's
            stimulus program sparked a 51.5 percent gain in the Topix
            benchmark index last year. While the index is down 13 percent
            since the start of this year, it's still higher than at any
            point from 2009 to 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for Japanese convertibles has been 10 to 15 times
            more than the amount of notes on offer since the beginning of
            2014, Takashi Masuda, head of equity linked products at Goldman
            in Tokyo, said in the same interview. Outstanding issuances have
            fallen to about 1.5 trillion yen ($14.8 billion) from about 10
            trillion yen in 2000, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bond Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese exchangeable-note returns fell 3.9 percent this
            year, following a 35 percent gain in 2013 which was their best
            performance since 1999, data from UBS AG show. While the bonds
            have insulated investors somewhat from stock-market declines,
            they're underperforming the 2.4 percent gain in convertible debt
            globally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All Japanese companies including Joyo Bank Ltd. sold $900
            million in dollar convertibles so far this year, compared with
            $1 billion for all of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are more than 100 companies in Yamagata with
            overseas operations and we will use the money to help meet their
            funding needs,' said Nobuhiro Konno, the manager of the general
            planning and coordination division at Yamagata Bank, based in
            northern Japan. 'Since the sale of dollar convertibles by
            Shizuoka, Iwate and Yamaguchi Financial, a lot of brokerages
            came to explain the product, and that was the catalyst for our
            sale.' The bank sold $100 million of five-year convertible
            debentures this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Yen Convertibles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other regional banks including Nagano Bank Ltd. and Daisan
            Bank Ltd. have issued yen-denominated convertibles this year,
            with financial institutions accounting for the biggest amount of
            sales by sector after industrials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shizuoka Bank's dollar notes due 2018 can be exchanged for
            shares at $13.46, or 18 percent above the closing stock price on
            April 9 in dollar terms. The stock was at the equivalent of
            $9.38 yesterday. Shares in Yamagata Bank closed at $4.01 April
            14, compared with a conversion price of $5.09 on its 2019 debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's cheap dollars, and all the larger regional banks are
            trying to increase their U.S. dollar lending as their clients
            increasingly venture overseas,' Graeme Knowd, an associate
            managing director who overseas financial institutions at Moody's
            Investors Service in Tokyo said in a phone interview. 'Given
            they lend to Japanese corporates, they probably need to fund as
            cheaply as possible.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Abe Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abe came to power in December 2012 calling for fiscal
            spending, deregulation and Bank of Japan monetary easing to
            raise the inflation rate to 2 percent. BOJ stimulus has helped
            weaken the yen more than 14 percent against the dollar since the
            end of 2012, bolstering the overseas earnings of Japanese
            companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen traded at 101.61 per dollar as of 5:22 p.m. in
            Tokyo yesterday, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield was at
            0.605 percent, the world's lowest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Non-yen-denominated lending by Shizuoka Bank rose 91
            percent to the equivalent of 414.4 billion yen at the end of
            last year, compared with a 5.5 percent increase in total loans
            to 6.98 trillion yen. The bank said yesterday it will seek to
            boost lending at overseas branches to $3 billion by March 2019
            from an estimated $1.72 billion for the fiscal year just ended
            as part of a medium-term plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Underwriter &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been the biggest manager of global
            convertible bonds for the last three years, underwriting about
            $14 billion in 2013 including notes sold by Yahoo Inc., Tesla
            Motors Inc. and Air France-KLM, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank hasn't underwritten any yen-denominated convertible bonds since it helped
            manage Sony
            Corp.'s 150 billion yen issue in November 2012. Prior to that
            Goldman helped manage one convertible bond deal each in 2009,
            2008 and 2007, by Japanese issuers, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Convertible sales this year may exceed last year, said
            Goldman's Masuda, adding the bank is looking to underwrite both
            yen and dollar-denominated deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If issuance continues to climb, we're confident of taking
            market share,' Masuda said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gross Loses to Goldman in Hot Bond Strategy as Pimco Lags</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Gross just can't catch a
            break. As investors flock to funds designed to make money even
            if interest rates increase, Gross's Pacific Investment
            Management Co. is alone among the biggest bond managers in
            suffering withdrawals from the strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a category that's been the most popular choice for
            fixed-income investors this year, the Pimco Unconstrained Bond
            Fund (PUBAX) has lost $2.7 billion to redemptions. Similar offerings
            from Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Co. and
            BlackRock Inc. have seen a surge of deposits from investors
            seeking to avoid potential bond-market losses. The Pimco fund
            has trailed a majority of peers over the past three and five
            years, and has lagged behind most rivals over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pimco has kind of shot themselves in the foot here,'
            said Steve Roge, a money manager with Bohemia, New York-based
            R.W. Roge Co., where he helps oversee $225 million. 'In a new
            category where there are other choices, why is someone going to
            look at a fund that has been a bottom performer?,' said Roge,
            who owns several Pimco funds but has no money in Pimco
            Unconstrained. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The redemptions from the fund are particularly painful for
            Pimco because bond managers are counting on the flexible
            strategy to attract money as investors flee traditional funds in
            anticipation of the end of a bull market in bonds. Gross's Pimco
            Total Return Fund (PTTRX) suffered record redemptions last year after
            the 70-year-old manager misjudged the impact of the Federal
            Reserve's move to scale back its bond-buying program -- a
            mistake echoed by the Unconstrained fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Non-traditional funds attracted $12.6 billion in the first
            three months of 2014, with offerings from Goldman Sachs,
            JPMorgan and BlackRock collecting a combined $10.7 billion
            through March, according to data from Chicago-based Morningstar
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, $24.3 billion Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund was
            Pimco's best-selling mutual fund as investors added $8.7
            billion. Industrywide, unconstrained or flexible funds as a
            group collected $55 billion last year. Intermediate funds, the
            biggest category of bond funds, which includes Pimco Total
            Return, saw withdrawals of $79 billion, Morningstar data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The redemptions over the past year mark a new phase for
            Pimco, which has more than doubled assets since 2008 as
            investors fled to the perceived safety of bonds following the
            financial crisis. As that rally has come to an end, Gross and
            the Newport Beach, California-based company he co-founded in
            1971 have faced their share of challenges this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;El-Erian Departure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In January, Gross's heir apparent, Mohamed El-Erian,
            unexpectedly announced his resignation as chief executive
            officer and co-chief investment officer. His departure was
            followed by reports of tension between the two. Gross lashed out
            at El-Erian in a June meeting as performance stumbled and
            withdrawals continued, two people familiar with the matter said
            this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Total Return suffered record redemptions of $41.1
            billion last year and lost its title as the world's biggest
            mutual fund. Clients pulled an estimated net $3.1 billion from
            the fund and $7.3 billion from all of Pimco's U.S. mutual funds
            in March, according to Morningstar. Pimco's assets under
            management declined to $1.94 trillion as of March. 31, from a
            peak of $2.04 trillion last March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained's former manager, Chris Dialynas, said
            in December that he was going to take a sabbatical. Gross took
            over the management of the fund, highlighting the importance of
            the strategy to the firm. Dialynas, who joined Pimco in 1980,
            had run the fund since it was created in June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gross Overhauls &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Gross took over management, he made changes including
            extending the effective duration, or sensitivity to interest
            rates, as well as jettisoning 30-year Treasuries (USGG30YR) and most of the
            agency mortgage bonds. The duration of the fund more than
            doubled to 4.1 years in December before falling back to 2.1
            years as of March 31, Pimco's website shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orange County Employees Retirement System voted Jan. 29 to
            put the Unconstrained strategy on a watch list for change in key
            personnel after investment consultant NEPC LLC said it had
            'elevated' concerns following the management change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flexible funds can buy anything in the fixed-income realm,
            from emerging market debt to credit default swaps, and they also
            have the ability to bet against rates, which means they make
            money if rates climb. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Wide Net' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We can cast a wide net, long or short,' said William
            Eigen, manager of the $26.3 billion JPMorgan Strategic Income
            Opportunities Fund, (JSOAX) which passed Pimco Unconstrained in March to
            become the biggest of what are considered non-traditional bond
            funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Unconstrained Bond fund has the flexibility to
            navigate across the fixed-income spectrum, it wasn't able to
            avoid losses last year because, along with other Pimco funds, it
            is guided by the firm's world view on everything from the global
            economy to interest rates. Gross, in a December interview posted
            on Pimco's website, said a model portfolio established by the
            firm's investment committee is the driving force behind the
            positioning of its funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Unconstrained Bond fund was hurt last year by holding
            intermediate and long-dated bonds when former Fed Chairman Ben
            S. Bernanke in May hinted that the central bank might scale back
            its bond-buying program. The subsequent increase in interest
            rates caused those bonds to lose value. The fund also suffered
            losses in its holdings of emerging-market debt, according to a
            December regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trailing Peers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained fell 2.6 percent last year, lagging
            behind 84 percent of peers, Morningstar data show. The fund's
            assets have declined 16 percent since July 31, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained has had 'unexciting,' results, Eric Jacobson, an analyst for Morningstar, wrote
            in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's also possible that the recent drama at Pimco is
            having some effect,' said Jacobson, referring to the departure
            of El-Erian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sabrina Callin, the product manager for Pimco's
            Unconstrained Bond strategy, which has $46 billion in assets,
            said it is not a surprise that some rival funds have done
            better. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shunning Credit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Many of the funds in this universe are very credit-oriented, especially high-yield credit,' said
            Callin in a
            telephone interview. 'People who have had that risk exposure
            have done well.' Credit generally refers to corporate debt,
            which is sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pimco Unconstrained has never been focused on corporate
            credit or other risk assets, she said. It is designed instead to
            preserve capital and limit losses in falling markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. high-yield bonds returned 7.4 percent in 2013,
            according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The Pimco
            fund had 2 percent of its money in junk bonds as of Dec. 31 and
            had a bet against the bonds as of Sept. 30, according to data on
            Pimco's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's Eigen said his fund had more than 40 percent of
            its money in high-yield bonds at the beginning of 2013. He cut
            that allocation to 25 percent as of Feb. 28, according to the
            fund's website, as the bonds rallied. JPMorgan Strategic Income
            Opportunities Fund climbed 2.8 percent in 2013, ahead of 74
            percent of rivals, according to Morningstar data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Beats &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $20.7 billion Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX),
            which gained 6.1 percent last year to beat 97 percent of peers,
            was generally bullish on corporate bonds in 2013 on the
            assumption the debt would do well in an improving economy,
            Jonathan Beinner, manager of the fund said in a telephone
            interview. The fund had 5.1 percent of its money in high-yield
            bonds as of Dec. 31, data from Goldman's website show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $14.8 billion BlackRock (BLK) Strategic Income Opportunities
            Portfolio, which rose 3 percent last year, had a 21 percent
            allocation to bonds rated BB or lower, below investment grade,
            as of Dec. 31, a blend of high-yield bonds, bank loans and
            emerging-market debt, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pimco fund has also had a different take than rivals on
            the maturities of bonds it prefers. Last year, the fund held
            intermediate and long-term bonds. This year, according to
            Pimco's website, the fund has invested at the front-end of the
            yield curve, usually defined as bonds with maturities of 1-5
            years, and has bet against longer-dated bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2014, the fund has advanced 1.3 percent, with the
            second-best returns of the four biggest flexible funds, trailing
            only the BlackRock fund. In March, shorter-term bonds fell as
            the Federal Reserve suggested it could begin raising interest
            rates in 2015. The bonds have rallied in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rieder's Approach &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rick Rieder, manager of BlackRock Strategic Income, took
            the exact opposite approach to Pimco's. He avoided longer-term
            debt in 2013, which helped his performance, he said in a
            telephone interview. He bought those bonds this year, another
            plus, and bet against bonds with between 3 years and 7 years of
            maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are not a lot of cheap assets out there so you have
            to be nimble,' said Rieder. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman and JPMorgan funds are both wagering that rates
            in general will climb this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are believers in an economic rebound, and you have to
            think rates will normalize as is the economy does,' said Eigen.
            Goldman expects rates to rise in the U.S., and the United
            Kingdom, said Beinner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Low Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross has argued the Fed will be in no rush to raise rates
            because inflation remains well below the central bank's target
            of 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Pimco, Callin said the goal of the Unconstrained Bond
            fund is to produce good risk-adjusted results over the long
            haul. In the past three years, the fund's risk-adjusted results
            were the lowest among the four funds, according to the Bloomberg
            Riskless Return Ranking. The BlackRock fund ranked first,
            followed by the Goldman fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Pimco may not get every call right every day or every
            year,' said Callin. 'But we have a good long-term record of
            getting things right for investors.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Saddam's Blighted Marsh Draws $150,000 Goldman Winner</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, Saddam Hussein diverted the flow of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, then drained and
            burned the marshes of southern Iraq. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasons were mainly political; the effect was
            an epic disaster that killed or displaced tens of thousands of people and threatened to erase the very
            cradle of civilization. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's where writing was invented,' said Azzam Alwash, 54, a dual
            citizen of Iraq and the U.S., and a force in the efforts to restore the Mesopotamian marshes. 'It's where
            the first cities were created. It's where agriculture started. It's where Abraham was born. The myth of
            creation is from there. It is not only Iraqi heritage, it is a world heritage.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shortly
            after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, Alwash left his Los Angeles home and career in hydraulic engineering to
            return to Iraq to help save the dessicated marshland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He started Nature Iraq, a
            nonprofit based in the town of Sulaimani, and consulted with the Madan, or Marsh Arabs. They had already
            begun punching holes in the walls of the canals built by Hussein, so that the area could seasonally flood
            again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alwash will be named today as one of the six 2013 recipients of the Goldman
            Environmental Prize. Each gets a bronze sculpture and $150,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I sat down recently with
            Alwash, a handsome man with graying hair, at Bloomberg's global headquarters in New York, and asked him what
            it was like in 2003, three months into the war, to see the marshes after so many years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Physical
            Disgust &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A feeling of physical disgust,' Alwash said. 'It's one thing seeing satellite
            pictures of the dried marshes, another thing seeing it at ground level. You know distance gives it
            abstractness. It's vast, but it doesn't give you that visual of what the desert looks like, especially a
            place that was so unique in your childhood.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He spoke of the horror of Basrah at the
            time -- the stench, the skeletal dogs and cats on the streets, the lost beauty of the city -- but his
            natural optimism overwhelmed the bitter memories: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There was also this hope in the air,
            just that everything and anything is possible. So while it was sad seeing your childhood place dead, you
            come in with this American attitude. It's like: Damn it, we're going to do it!' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten
            years on, the marshes are restored to more than 50 percent of their original size and the Madan are
            returning. It has been a monumental job under hellacious conditions -- war, terrorism, poverty and
            tumultuous social and political change. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;American Mistakes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'How do
            you convert 50 years of socialism into a free market?' Alwash asked. 'How do you separate church from state?
            And what was fascinating for me, for the first seven years and even now, I see the Americans making mistake
            after mistake, but they're not listening to people like me.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government did
            help with marsh restoration at first, but after an initial $175,000 in aid, it gave no more, Alwash said. He
            partly blamed his own conflicts with the U.S. Agency for International Development. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I
            just couldn't get along with USAID. It was my attitude. I don't like being told what to do and what not to
            do, and I don't like people who tell me it can't be done. The experts telling me it can't be done were hired
            by USAID.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Italy provided funding and consultants, and this month a sizable piece of the
            marshes will become Iraq's first national park. Alwash is also involved with a survey of more than 300
            biodiversity sites throughout Iraq, looking to further expand protected areas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Oil
            Income &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iraq's recovery will depend on how it develops its oil fields, many of which are
            in the south. Alwash has a pragmatic take on the subject. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I might be viewed as a
            heretic in the environmental movement, but my point of view with respect to Iraq is that the world needs oil
            and Iraq needs income,' he said. 'I would rather be inside the tent working with oil companies and with Iraq
            on responsible development than outside the tent demonstrating without being effective.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            next threat to the marshes will probably not be oil, however, but the many dams tapping into the river
            systems upstream, including one of Turkey's largest along the Tigris, set for completion next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's another thing coming up on the horizon that nobody's talking about,' Alwash said. 'The
            issue of water: That's going to be a problem and that's going to be my next challenge.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Goldman
            Winners &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other Goldman Environmental Prize winners are: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jonathan
            Deal, who led a successful campaign against fracking in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rossano Ercolini,
            an elementary-school teacher whose public-education campaign about the dangers of incinerators in his small
            Tuscan town became a national 'Zero Waste'' movement in Italy &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aleta Baun, an Indonesian
            who organized peaceful protests at marble mining sites and helped halt the destruction of forestland on
            Mutis Mountain on the island of Timor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimberly Wasserman, who led a campaign to shut

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Closes Brent GSCI Recommendation After 16% Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            was ending a recommendation to hold a long position in the SP
            GSCI Brent Total Return Index amid disappointing oil demand and
            refinery maintenance in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holding the position, first recommended in August, would
            have resulted in a 16 percent loss, the bank said in an e-mailed
            report today. Weakness in European demand for refined fuels and
            a slowdown in China, are weighing on prices even as global
            inventory levels remain tight, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the tug of war between tight global oil fundamentals
            and the negative sentiment created by weak European product
            markets and fears of further Chinese slowdown, the latter
            currently prevail,' Jeff Currie, head of commodities research
            in New York, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro-zone economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013 as it
            struggles to move past its debt crisis, the European Commission
            predicted on Feb. 22. Economic expansion unexpectedly eased in
            China, the world's largest energy consumer, according to data
            for the first quarter from the Beijing-based National Bureau of
            Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent slumped as much as 2.6 percent today to a nine-month
            low of $100.41 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'European margins could suffer further as the European
            refinery turnaround season has peaked and more and more
            refineries are coming back from maintenance,' Currie said.
            'This could put further downward pressure on Brent prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' advice to take a long position in the Brent
            index on Aug. 21 was a modification of earlier recommendation to
            buy West Texas Intermediate crude contracts. That suggestion
            would have resulted in a 10.8 percent loss. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Shares Fall as Trading Revenue Misses Estimates</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall Street bank that generates the highest percentage of
            revenue from trading, dropped as much as 3 percent after revenue from that business fell more than its
            rivals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares slumped 1.6 percent to $144.10 in New York at 4:15 p.m., the
            second-largest decline in the 81-company Standard Poor's 500 Financials Index (S5FINL). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs's first-quarter revenue from trading stocks and fixed-income products fell 12 percent to $5.22
            billion, excluding accounting charges. That missed some analysts' estimates, including $5.48 billion from
            Oppenheimer Co.'s Chris Kotowski and $5.25 billion from Credit Suisse Group AG's Howard Chen. The revenue
            decline at New York-based Goldman Sachs was bigger than at Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman's trading expertise has less value right now because they can't deploy it as they used
            to,' Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. who rates the stock outperform, told Erik Schatzker
            on Bloomberg Television. 'Trading is going to have a difficult time taking off from this point.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currency- and commodity-trading revenue was $3.26 billion, down 9 percent from a year
            earlier, excluding the accounting charge related to the firm's own debt. Revenue from the equities division,
            overseen by co-Chief Operating Officers R. Martin Chavez, Michael D. Daffey and Paul M. Russo, declined 17
            percent from a year earlier to $1.96 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Traders Cede Tokyo Party Bar to Google-Apple Invasion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The champagne used to flow at Heartland, the bar in Tokyo's Roppongi Hills complex that drew
            bankers from the Japan headquarters of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
            upstairs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Every day, there was a party,' said Mai Shioya, the 39- year-old manager, who
            started in May 2008 before the global financial crisis that led to Lehman's bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bankers
            in well-cut suits would come in about 5 p.m., hand bartenders corporate credit cards and let their friends
            charge drinks to the tab until 2 a.m., said Michio Nakamura, 45, who's been running events and entertainment
            at Heartland since its opening as part of the famed Roppongi Hills development in 2003. After the financial
            crisis, many disappeared, cutting revenue by 30 percent, Shioya said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Those customers
            and that age have gone,' she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The void is being filled by a new group of bar
            patrons: information-technology workers. While financial firms have cut staff in Japan, technology companies
            have boosted hiring, and as bankers vacated offices at Roppongi Hills, companies including Google Inc.
            (GOOG) and Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) moved in. As early as this month, Apple Inc. (AAPL) will also make the
            complex its home in Japan, two people familiar with the plan said in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Hiring
            demand for IT workers is very high,' said Taizo Hattori, a director for information technology at Career
            Incubation Inc., a Tokyo-based recruiting and consulting company. 'Many IT firms have doubled headcounts.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vacating Floors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, one of the original tenants which
            has been reducing headcount and moving jobs elsewhere in Asia, is in talks with its landlord to vacate two
            of the six floors it occupies in the 54-story Mori Tower, part of the $2.2 billion Roppongi Hills complex
            developed by Mori Building Co. (MBDZ), two people with knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lehman's
            Asian business was bought by Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., and its Japan operations were transferred to
            the Otemachi business district in 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. and European banks have been eliminating
            jobs and transferring staff from Japan to Hong Kong and Singapore to reduce expenses. Goldman Sachs led
            foreign banks in accelerating job cuts at their Japanese brokerages, according to filings with Japan's
            Financial Services Agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Japanese brokerage unit had 847 employees as
            of March 31, 2012, down about 30 percent from 1,205 in March 2008, the filings show. Barclays Plc (BARC),
            whose Japan headquarters is also at Roppongi Hills, was another that reduced brokerage staff, according to
            the filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Visible Changes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The changes are visible at Heartland,
            located at the street level of the landmark Mori Tower, said Shioya, the manager. Originally opened to
            promote Heartland brand beer, brewed by Tokyo-based Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), it's one of several bars and
            restaurants in Roppongi Hills, which also includes upscale shops, a hotel, apartments, a movie theater and
            an art museum. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People used to be drinking more,' she said. 'Some customers opened seven
            bottles of champagne for their birthdays. Some would ask us to prepare 100 champagne glasses for
            celebrations, and they were offering them to bar staff and strangers.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With fewer
            bankers and more patrons from the tech world, the atmosphere has become more laid back, Shioya said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After business declined following the financial crisis, the bar began showing sporting events on
            its big-screen display to draw customers. Couches where well-dressed men and mini-skirted women once paired
            up to lounge and drink cocktails were replaced with tables and stools. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Clientele Change
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The bankers were often drinking with ladies who came here to meet foreign businessmen,
            who were looking to marry a wealthy banker and go overseas,' Shioya said, adding that now the women who come
            tend to be office workers looking to practice English. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a recent Friday evening, male
            patrons in jeans or cargo pants, unshaven, wearing baseball caps or carrying backpacks were as numerous as
            men in suits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's changed a lot, especially the clientele,' said Felix Beatty, an
            information-risk-management specialist from Montreal who was celebrating his 36th birthday by drinking
            Heartland beer instead of champagne. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As their hangout transformed, some of the remaining
            bankers abandoned it for Rigoletto, a bar and restaurant on the fifth floor, said Beatty, who's been coming
            to Heartland since 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April 2009, after overseas financial companies cut about
            4,300 jobs, or 16 percent of their Japan workforce in 15 months, Heartland hosted a 'pink-slip party' to
            help unemployed bankers network and find new jobs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Google Expansion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially
            occupying 1 1/2 floors at Mori Tower, Google's offices now take up the 26th, 28th and 30th floors, as well
            as most of the 27th. The Mountain View, California-based company declined in an e-mail to disclose its
            number of employees in the building. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo (992), the world's second-largest maker of
            personal computers, moved its Japan headquarters to Roppongi Hills in April 2010. Google, operator of the
            world's biggest search engine, relocated from Tokyo's Shibuya district in August the same year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other information-technology companies in Mori Tower include Baidu Inc. (BIDU), operator of China's
            most-popular search engine; Gree Inc. (3632), a Japanese social-networking game site operator; and San
            Francisco-based Salesforce.com, the biggest maker of online customer-management software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Roppongi
            Hills is sort of a tech hub,' said Joseph Schmidt, a spokesman for Salesforce.com. The site's central
            location and gas-operated power generators to keep offices working during earthquake-related power cuts make
            it 'second to none' for business-continuity planning, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Valuable Proximity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Baidu, proximity to other information-technology companies is valuable, said Kaiser Kuo, a
            spokesman for the Beijing-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo, which started out with one floor at
            Mori Tower, has since expanded to a second, said Angela Lee, a spokeswoman for the Beijing-based company,
            which now has about 300 employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Having our main office in Roppongi Hills has brought
            a positive impact on employees' motivation and recruiting,' Lee said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple, based in
            Cupertino, California, will move to Roppongi Hills from Tokyo's Shinjuku district as early as this month and
            will occupy one or two floors, the people familiar with the plan said. Apple didn't respond to requests for
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'IT firms are attracted because of the business environment,' Tomohiro Akita, a
            spokesman for Mori Building, said of Mori Tower, citing the in-house power generators, hotel and conference
            space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hiring Jump &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hiring at information-technology and
            communications companies through three of Japan's biggest recruiting agencies jumped 23 percent from a year
            earlier to 3,093 people in the six months ended Sept. 30, the Japan Executive Search and Recruitment
            Association said in a report in November. Financial- services hiring rose 7.5 percent to 830, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for information-technology staff is outpacing supply and has been accelerating since early
            this year, Career Incubation's Hattori said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Internet-service companies that target
            consumers are making money and are cash-rich,' he said. 'They can afford to invest in human resources and
            are especially interested in people who can develop business overseas.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rents for prime
            office space in Tokyo have fallen more than 40 percent from a peak in the first quarter of 2008, according
            to property broker Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., prompting more companies to relocate as they seek to upgrade
            office space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Falling Rent &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rental value in the Akasaka and
            Roppongi areas in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 57 percent of the 2008 peak, according to Jones Lang.
            That's attracted new tenants, cutting the vacancy rate in the area to 2.7 percent as of September from 3.3
            percent the preceding quarter, data from Jones Lang show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Geeks have increased around
            the area,' said Hattori of Career Incubation. 'Even some manager-level people who earn a lot of money wear
            jeans and athletic shoes. Probably they don't have to care about their clothes as they are just happy as
            long as they can produce something interesting.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technology companies have also
            transformed the commercial real-estate market in New York, helping offset sluggish demand from
            financial-services firms. Lower Manhattan office vacancies fell in the first quarter to the lowest since
            2008 as technology and creative firms moved in, Cushman Wakefield said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            chances of a resurgence in financial-firm hiring in Tokyo aren't great, said Tetsuya Sakabe, managing
            director at Kanae Associates Ltd., an executive-search firm specializing in the industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's
            no strong demand for bankers in the mergers-and- acquisitions field,' he said. 'And not for debt and equity
            capital markets, either.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Gold Slump Sparked by European Sale Concern, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The selloff in gold that cut futures 13 percent over two days was sparked by investor concern that
            European governments may have to follow Cyprus in selling part of their holdings, according to Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The slump, which drove prices to their lowest level since January 2011 today,
            was exacerbated as the metal fell below so- called technical-support levels, analysts including Jeff Currie
            and Damien Courvalin said in a report dated today, entitled 'There Are Weeks When Decades Happen.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold has plunged into a bear market as investors reduced holdings in exchange-traded products amid
            signs the U.S. economy is recovering, paring haven demand. Goldman said April 10 the turn in the gold cycle
            was quickening and investors should sell the metal. The drop in the past two days was one of the largest
            corrections in modern history, according to Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The sharp selloff in gold
            was triggered by growing fears that the central bank of Cyprus would sell its gold reserves, potentially
            reflecting a larger monetization of gold reserves across other European central banks,' the Goldman analysts
            wrote in the report dated today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bullion for June delivery was 1.3 percent higher at
            $1,378.50 an ounce on the Comex at 5:33 p.m. in Singapore after losing as much as 2.9 percent to $1,321.50.
            Futures plunged 9.3 percent yesterday after entering a bear market last week, falling more than 20 percent
            from the record close in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;India is close to appointing
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to manage an exchange-traded fund that
            will include companies part-owned by the government, said three
            people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The selection of New York-based Goldman's asset management
            unit is awaiting approval from Indian Finance Minister
            Palaniappan Chidambaram, said one of the people, who asked not
            to be identified as the process is private. It will then go to
            the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, this person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An aide to President Pranab Mukherjee said in September
            that India was working on an exchange-traded fund that tracks
            state-owned companies, as the government seeks to attract money
            to its stock market. Officials haven't decided which stocks will
            be included in the fund, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Pay Pool Shrinks 1% in First Quarter After Job Cuts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
            $4.34 billion to pay employees in the first quarter, about 1
            percent less than a year earlier, as the firm employed 400 fewer
            people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The compensation expense was equal 43 percent of revenue,
            down from 44 percent in the first quarter of 2012, the New York-
            based company said today in a statement. The sum, which covers
            salaries, benefits and accruals for year-end bonuses, is enough
            to give each of the bank's 32,000 employees $135,594 for the
            first three months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, the fifth-
            biggest U.S. bank by assets, are cutting costs and jobs to
            improve shareholder returns. The company, led by Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has trimmed compensation
            expenses by more than a third in the five years through 2012,
            while revenue fell 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock climbed 41 percent last year, showing that
            shareholders were 'relatively happy' with the firm's
            compensation decisions in 2012, President Gary Cohn said in a
            Bloomberg Television interview in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You'll never get it perfect, but I think we got it
            right,' said Cohn, 52. 'Relative to the competitive landscape
            that we operate in, our people got paid relatively fairly,
            relative to the contribution they made to the firm and to our
            share price.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Banker Said to Seek Debut RedBird Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;RedBird Capital Partners LLC, co-founded by a former leader of the private-equity business at
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is seeking $400 million for a debut
            fund to help back entrepreneurs and business owners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gerald Cardinale, 46, the former co-head of Americas
            private-equity funds at Goldman Sachs, and Earl Rotman, 58, are
            targeting a first close of about $150 million within weeks, said
            a person with knowledge of the fundraising, who asked not to be
            named because the information is private. The two started the
            firm last year and will mainly invest in media and
            entertainment, sports, communication-infrastructure and
            consumer-goods companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cardinale spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs, where
            he managed more than $6 billion in investments, including a
            stake in Yankees Entertainment Sports Network, which was
            founded in 2001 to broadcast the games of the New York Yankees
            baseball team and New Jersey Nets basketball team. In 2007, he
            worked with Yankees third-baseman Alex Rodriguez to help
            negotiate a new contract, people familiar with the matter said
            at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adrian Maizey, chief operating officer at New York-based
            RedBird, declined to comment on fundraising. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cardinale and Rotman worked together for the first time in
            2006, when Goldman Sachs's private-equity unit and CanWest
            Global Communications, which was led by Leonard Asper, looked to
            purchase Canadian media company Alliance Atlantis
            Communications. Cardinale helped structure the deal, while
            Rotman represented the Asper family. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Leaving Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Cardinale, known as Gerry, along with two other
            senior employees of Goldman Sachs's merchant bank left as the
            bank prepared for regulations that would limit its investments
            in private-equity funds to 3 percent. Cardinale joined merchant
            bank BDT Capital Partners, where he decided he wanted to back
            entrepreneurs and business owners so left the firm and teamed
            with Rotman to form RedBird, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rotman had built a business before, when he co-founded
            Genuity Capital Markets in 2005, which merged with Canaccord
            Financial Inc. in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The debut RedBird fund will make equity and structured
            equity investments of $30 million to $80 million, according to a
            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. It will target
            companies with $25 million to $50 million of earnings before
            interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, said the person,
            and will also make lifestyle, hospitality and gaming
            investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RedBird is gathering commitments as first-time funds find
            it harder to attract capital. Debut pools raised $5 billion in
            the first quarter, the lowest amount in that period since the
            financial crisis, according to London-based researcher Preqin
            Ltd. Investors have been narrowing the number of managers they
            want to back, making the environment more competitive for fund
            managers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
            fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, gained regulatory approval to
            run a branch of its commercial bank in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Bank USA received the license on March 21,
            according to a filing with Britain's Financial Conduct
            Authority. The branch will be able to accept deposits, advise on
            investments and arrange the safeguarding and administration of
            assets, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are pleased that the request has been approved,'
            Sophie Bullock, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in London, said
            today by e-mail. 'The bank's clients are global and it is
            important for a number of them to be able to transact with the
            bank in London.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) were the largest U.S.
            securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
            after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
            Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
            and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
            window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks.
            Goldman Sachs Bank USA was set up as a New York State-chartered
            bank in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday that first-quarter net income
            rose 7 percent to $2.26 billion, or $4.29 a share, from $2.11
            billion, or $3.92, a year earlier. That was higher than all 24
            analysts' estimates in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financial News reported the approval for a commercial-bank
            branch earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Seek Early Dismissal of Libya Wealth Fund Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will seek
            to have a $1 billion lawsuit by the Libyan Investment Authority
            thrown out before trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank will ask a London judge to decide whether the case
            has a realistic chance of success and issue a so-called summary
            judgment, according to court documents released this week.
            Libya's sovereign wealth fund says Goldman made about
            $350 million selling investments that turned out to be
            worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The LIA said in a statement it 'considers this application
            to be misconceived and looks forward to full and proper
            determination of all issues by the English court.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libya's sovereign wealth fund is one of dozens of small
            companies and government agencies that have sued lenders over
            deals the investors claim were too complicated to understand. It
            also sued Societe Generale SA (GLE) in a $1.5 billion lawsuit, saying
            that the French bank paid about $58 million to a friend of the
            Qaddafi family to secure investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The LIA must convince a judge that its claim has some
            chance of success to defeat the summary judgment application.
            The case has been put on hold until the court decides on whether
            it can continue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman
            Sachs International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice,
            Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) posted a jump in first-quarter trading revenue while Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            (GS)'s dropped, the first such divergence in two years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley today reported a
            surprise 9 percent increase in fixed-income trading revenue, the only gain among major Wall Street banks,
            and had the biggest improvement in equity trading as it overtook its larger rival for the top spot in that
            business. Goldman Sachs suffered the sharpest decline in equity trading, citing a slump in Japan and
            emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
            still beat analysts' estimates as the firm posted the most investment-banking revenue among U.S. banks for
            the first time since the financial crisis. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman got a rare win as fixed-income
            revenue was the highest in two years even as the company continued to shrink capital used by the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When the Street disappoints in fixed-income, Morgan Stanley does well, and when the Street does
            well, Morgan Stanley tends to disappoint,' Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., said in a
            Bloomberg Radio interview. 'Weak fixed-income quarter: Morgan Stanley did well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan
            Stanley rose 4.1 percent to $31.11 at 9:51 a.m. in New York, the biggest intraday advance since January.
            Goldman Sachs climbed 1.4 percent to $159.42. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gorman's firm still had the lowest trading
            revenue among the Wall Street banks at $3.36 billion, and both it and Goldman Sachs trailed JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Citigroup Inc. All of the New York-based firms are facing a prolonged slump in fixed-income trading,
            which has fallen in nine of the past 13 quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Business Mix &lt;/h2&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's O'Neill Says Bank of Japan Can Beat Deflation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of Japan (8301) can achieve its
            goal of 2 percent inflation within two years and may need to
            concern itself with containing prices if it succeeds, according
            to Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O'Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the central bank is truly committed to reaching its
            target, then it can, London-based O'Neill said at a Goldman
            Sachs seminar in Tokyo today. BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda has
            pledged to do 'whatever it takes' to beat deflation and plans
            to double the monetary base -- cash in circulation and the money
            that financial institutions have on deposit at the central bank
            -- within two years in pursuit of that goal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've set it themselves and they've got to keep doing
            things to get to what is their target,' O'Neill said. 'If they
            do start to get 2 percent inflation in the next two years, how
            do they stop it going, at least for a brief while, to quite a
            bit more than 2 percent. That to me would be more of a valid
            issue than whether they will be able to do it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 56-year-old's confidence in Japan's central bank runs
            counter to skeptics from Bill Gross, who runs the world's
            biggest bond fund, to former BOJ Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata.
            The Topix Index, Japan's broadest equity measure, has rallied 55
            percent since November on pledges to end deflation while the
            two-year rate on overnight-index swaps, used to wager on changes
            in the BOJ's target rate, is set for its biggest monthly jump
            since November 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP and
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reached a settlement in a dispute over
            residential mortgage-backed securities purchased by the fund
            from 2005 to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We now are pleased to see that these cases are concluded
            satisfactorily one by one,' Henk Brouwer, chairman of Heerlen,
            Netherlands-based ABP, said in a statement today. 'We have full
            confidence that all will be completed in due course, evidencing
            that all parties involved are looking to the future, leaving
            past grievances and practices behind them.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ABP sued New York-based Goldman Sachs in New York State
            Supreme Court in January 2012. The company alleged that it
            purchased certain mortgage-backed securities in reliance on
            false and misleading statements and that the securities were
            riskier than had been represented, backed by mortgage loans
            worth significantly less than had been represented. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Harmen Geers, an ABP spokesman, declined to comment on the
            amount of the settlement. Stampa Communications, based in
            Amsterdam and representing Goldman Sachs in the Netherlands,
            also declined to comment when contacted by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
            part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
            biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
            and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
            market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The largest U.S. banks can remain entangled with each other now that global regulators have
            loosened proposed limits on the financial web that led to investor panic in 2008 and prompted bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which set out a year ago to block banks from relying
            too heavily on each other, changed course last week, opting to let firms preserve most derivatives and
            repurchase agreements among themselves. The panel revised formulas for evaluating exposure and used a
            broader definition of capital. Those tweaks spare about $1 trillion in deals at seven of the biggest U.S.
            banks that would have exceeded proposed limits, according to a November study by the Clearing House, an
            industry group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Basel panel of regulators from 27 countries has bowed to industry
            pressure before to weaken new rules. Liquidity standards and leverage ratios also were altered so the
            largest firms came much closer to being in compliance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'That seems to be the name of the game, fighting every rule to the ground,' said Anat Admati, a
            Stanford University finance professor. 'The fact that the banks were so concerned with counterparty limits
            and fought them so hard shows how interconnected they are. That makes them too big to fail.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman May Beat Wall Street ROE, Hintz Says: Tom Keene</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
            Street bank that generates the highest percentage of revenue
            from trading, may be able to post a higher return on equity than
            competitors, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein
            Co. analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs could generate ROE, a measure of how well the
            bank reinvests shareholder money, of 15 percent to 20 percent,
            Hintz said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Tom Keene. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That would make the New York-based company an 'outlier'
            among the biggest banks and Wall Street firms, which probably
            will generate ROE of about 12 percent to 15 percent, Hintz said.
            Banks will continue to trim compensation in an effort to boost
            returns, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's annualized ROE was 12.4 percent in the first
            quarter, above the 10.7 percent it reported for all of 2012.
            Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last week that the
            firm doesn't have enough information about pending regulations
            to provide a new target, which was set at a 20 percent return on
            tangible equity before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Copper Selloff Overdone, Is Bullish at Lower Prices</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
            the selloff in copper was 'overdone' and it remains bullish on
            the metal at a lower price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank cut its three-month estimate to $7,500 a metric
            ton from $8,000, lowered its six-month prediction to $8,000 from
            $9,000, and the 12-month forecast fell to $7,000 from $8,000,
            Goldman analysts including London-based Max Layton and Hong
            Kong-based Roger Yuan said in a report dated today. Copper for
            three-month delivery traded at $6,905 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The metal has lost 13 percent this year and slumped into a
            bear market as Europe struggled with its debt crisis and growth
            slowed in China, the biggest metals consumer. Europe and China
            account for about 60 percent of world consumption. Inventories
            tracked by the London Metal Exchange almost doubled in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forecasts have been downgraded 'to acknowledge the
            increasing willingness of the market to price future surplus
            ahead of time' and the risks to growth in the broader emerging
            market, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While prices have suffered on concerns China's economy may
            slow, the bank said the country's 'underlying cyclical growth
            is likely stronger than the headline figures suggest.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copper in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures
            Exchange is being drawn down, it said. The bank estimated bonded
            stockpiles at 510,000 tons from 715,000 tons in early March and
            noted that futures in Shanghai are in backwardation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Partner to Help Raise Funds for Crick Institute</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Manby, a senior partner at
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., will lead a 100 million-pound ($152
            million) fundraising campaign for the Francis Crick Institute,
            which will be Europe's largest biomedical research center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manby will be chairman of the 16-member board collecting
            the money for Cancer Research UK, which is contributing to the
            institute's 650 million-pound construction cost and its 120
            million-pound annual budget. The board includes the chief
            executive officers of International Standard Asset Management,
            Ted Baker Plc (TED), Ingenious, Newton Investment Management, New York
            Times Co. (NYT), and WPP Plc (WPP), Cancer Research UK said today in an e-
            mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The institute will open in London in 2015. Paul Nurse, a
            2001 Nobel Prize winner in physiology or medicine for work on
            cell cycle regulation, is leading a four-year effort to build
            the facility. At 1 million square feet and with as many as 1,500
            employees, including 1,250 scientists, he said the Crick
            Institute will become Europe's biggest science research center
            in one building. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The institute will take new approaches in carrying out
            biomedical research aimed at speeding up scientific discovery
            and the application of those discoveries,' Nurse said in the
            statement. 'We need the funds to make this a reality.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;CEO Members &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;International Standard Asset Management CEO Stanley Fink,
            Ted Baker CEO Ray Kelvin, Ingenious CEO Patrick McKenna, Newton
            Investment CEO Helena Morrissey, WPP CEO Martin Sorrell and New
            York Times CEO Mark Thompson will work with Manby to raise money
            for the institute, according to the cancer charity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other members of the Cancer Research UK fundraising board
            are Sherry Coutu, an investor who serves on the finance board of
            Cambridge University; former HSBC Holdings Plc CEO Michael Geoghegan; David Harding, founder and president
            of Winton
            Capital Management LLC; Richard Hayden, chairman of Haymarket
            Financial; Autonomy Corp. co-founder Mike Lynch; Hayat Palumbo,
            chairman of the Walbrook Club; Andrew Pisker, co-founder of
            Richmond Park Partners LLP and former CEO of Dresdner Kleinwort
            Wasserstein; Lee Portnoi, former chairman of TIS Group Ltd; and
            Mark Yallop, U.K. group country CEO at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government-funded Medical Research Council is
            paying 300 million pounds of the Crick's construction costs, the
            Wellcome Trust is providing 120 million pounds and London-based
            Cancer Research UK is contributing 160 million pounds. Imperial
            College London, King's College London and University College
            London are pitching in 40 million pounds each. The total
            includes contingency funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The expected 120 million-pound annual budget will come from
            the same sources. Cancer Research will fund 40 million pounds to
            50 million pounds a year and the Wellcome Trust will give an
            undetermined amount, the heads of both groups said. The
            remainder will come from the government and the universities. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Backs Mullen in Rentals After Subprime Short</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Donald R. Mullen Jr., who helped Goldman Sachs Group Inc. profit from the U.S. housing crash, is
            giving the firm and its clients a way to gain from the recovery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mullen, 54, has raised
            almost $1 billion to buy single- family houses to rent since leaving Goldman Sachs last year as head of
            global credit and mortgages, five years after overseeing the bank's bet against the imploding subprime
            home-loan market. His Fundamental REO LLC has already purchased or is close to acquiring almost 2,500
            properties through foreclosure auctions, government agencies and even an Arizona non-profit that promotes
            affordable-home ownership, property records show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mullen plans to spend as much as $2
            billion by 2016, joining private-equity giants including Blackstone Group LP (BX) and Colony Capital LLC
            seeking to take advantage of home prices 29 percent below the 2006 peak and rising demand for rentals from
            Americans blocked out of homeownership. Investors, including former bankers and bond traders, are rushing to
            buy and renovate properties, as well as secure Wall Street funding to turn what's been a mom and pop
            business into an institutional asset class. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street Is My Landlord&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This
            is the biggest trade in the real estate space,' said Justin Berman, a former Goldman Sachs banker who runs
            Atlanta-based Berman Capital Advisors, a private wealth firm with about $550 million under management. 'They
            can't get their hands on enough homes.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Apollo-to-Goldman Embracing Insurers Spurs State Concerns</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Until April 2011, Patrick 'Pete' Dodd, a former money manager at Liberty Life Insurance Co. in
            Greenville, South Carolina, invested customer premiums in what he calls a 'squeaky clean' portfolio: bonds
            backed by state governments and blue chip corporations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then a company funded by private
            equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) acquired Liberty and inherited its clientele, mostly people
            approaching retirement who had bought annuities from the company to supplement their Social Security. Now
            the unit's holdings include securities backed by subprime mortgages, time-share vacation homes and a
            railroad in Kazakhstan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'When you look at the business model these guys use, where
            they're substantially increasing the risk in the bond portfolio, sooner or later, in my opinion, that has to
            come home to roost,' said Dodd, 55, who helped manage $4 billion before the sale to New York-based Apollo's
            Athene Holding Ltd. 'All the upside would go to Athene if it worked out. And the downside would go to the
            annuity holders if it didn't.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms such as Apollo, Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS), Harbinger Group Inc. and Guggenheim Partners LLC are acquiring life insurance companies and
            shaking up a staid industry with investments in everything from the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team to
            mortgage-backed securities that cratered during the financial crisis. The newcomers are meeting resistance
            from some state insurance regulators accustomed to vanilla portfolios, who have warned about exposing
            policyholders to greater risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Troubling Role' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;New York State may
            need to modernize its regulations to deal with the increased presence and 'troubling role' of private-equity
            firms in selling annuities, which promise regular payments to policyholders, Benjamin Lawsky, New York state
            superintendent of financial services, said in a speech last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The risk we're
            concerned about at DFS is whether these private-equity firms are more short-term focused, when this is a
            business that's all about the long haul,' Lawsky said. 'Their focus is on maximizing their immediate
            financial returns, rather than ensuring that promised retirement benefits are there at the end of the day
            for policyholders.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms can be very successful even if some of their
            ventures fail, he said. 'This type of business model isn't necessarily a natural fit for the insurance
            business, where a failure can put policyholders at very significant risk.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Address
            Change &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apollo and Goldman Sachs both shifted the legal addresses of their South
            Carolina insurers out of state after its regulators limited their investing strategies. For New York-based
            Goldman Sachs, the move came after it hired the state's former insurance director as a lobbyist and appealed
            for help to the South Carolina governor's office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Companies want to do things, and then
            when a regulator tries to do their job, then they go find a domicile that will let them do what they want,'
            said Scott H. Richardson, who was the South Carolina insurance director when Goldman Sachs left the state
            for the nation's capital in 2009. 'We weren't being friendly enough to them, so they went to D.C.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money managers say their investments are no more dangerous than those of traditional insurers,
            and that they're managing them with a long-term view. In a key measure of financial health known as the
            risk-based capital ratio, the units far surpass the minimums required by state regulators. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Less
            Risky' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some of its investments are unorthodox, 'our portfolio is less risky than
            traditional life-insurance companies,' said James R. Belardi, chief executive officer of Apollo's
            Bermuda-based Athene unit. It is 'a reason why people should invest in our company, as opposed to the
            unsuccessful strategies of traditional life insurance companies, which has been an underperforming sector in
            the economy for many, many years.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guggenheim's insurance units bought part of the Los
            Angeles Dodgers last year, when Guggenheim CEO Mark Walter led a $2 billion purchase of the baseball team.
            Its insurance arms invested about $100 million, according to a person close to the company who spoke on
            condition of anonymity because of Major League Baseball confidentiality rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guggenheim's
            insurance arms invest conservatively, and it plans to own them for a long time, said Michael Sitrick, a
            spokesman. A money manager based in New York and Chicago, Guggenheim also advises traditional insurers about
            their investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investing premiums in a baseball team is 'a little odd,' said Nick
            Gerhart, the insurance commissioner for Iowa, one of five states that oversee Guggenheim insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Apollo's Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later this year, Gerhart is expected to review Apollo's
            biggest insurance takeover yet -- its $1.8 billion agreement to buy the West Des Moines-based U.S. operation
            of London-based Aviva Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This move from private equity into insurance is relatively a
            new phenomenon, and I don't know how many regulators have even spent time thinking about it,' said Gerhart.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene's plans to acquire Aviva's U.S. operation disturbed Michael Garcia, a retired
            phone company salesman in the Los Angeles suburbs. Garcia, 61, spent most of his life savings on an Aviva
            annuity last year, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The new owners, Apollo, are not an insurance company.
            They're a private-equity company. That's a big difference,' he said. 'So obviously my concern is: Are these
            people going to keep enough reserves? Are they going to play by the rules that insurance companies have to
            play by?' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Don't play poker with our money,' Garcia said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fee
            Revenue &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;By routing at least some of their insurance units' investments to funds managed
            by the parent company, the Wall Street firms can generate fee revenue. Athene, for instance, put about a
            third of its $15.8 billion of assets into Apollo funds, including collateralized loan obligations and
            private equity, generating fees for Apollo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harbinger Group tried the same tactic.
            Controlled by Philip Falcone's Harbinger Capital Partners LLC hedge-fund firm, Harbinger Group entered the
            insurance business in 2011 when it bought an annuity provider in Maryland from London-based Old Mutual Plc.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harbinger soon sought to transfer $3 billion of the Maryland firm's business to an
            insurance company it owns in Bermuda, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. About $1
            billion would be managed by Falcone's hedge fund firm and invested in assets rated non-investment grade, or
            junk, below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and less than BBB-by Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Proposal
            Rejected &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maryland regulators rejected the proposal last year. The deal may 'adversely
            affect interests of policyholders,' wrote Neil Miller, an associate Maryland insurance commissioner. 'There
            is no assurance that the investment manager will successfully mitigate the risks.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harbinger
            later won approval for a smaller deal involving more traditional assets, which the hedge fund wouldn't
            manage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since it made the original proposal to Maryland, Harbinger Group has changed its
            strategy, said Phil Gass, a managing director, adding that it owns fewer junk-rated securities than most
            insurers. Unlike private-equity funds, Harbinger, a publicly traded company, can hold onto acquisitions
            indefinitely and takes a long-term view, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fixed Annuities &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Wall Street-backed insurers primarily sell retirement-savings products known as fixed annuities. Wall Street
            firms account for 15 percent of the fixed annuity market, up from 4 percent a year ago, Lawsky said in his
            speech. The planned Aviva acquisition by Apollo, one of the world's largest private-equity firms, would make
            Athene the second-largest U.S. seller of fixed annuities. Athene targets return on equity of 16 percent to
            20 percent, according to an Apollo presentation in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawrence J. Rybka, chief
            executive officer of ValMark Securities Inc., said his firm won't sell the new insurers' annuities, in part
            because their financial-strength ratings from A.M. Best Co. aren't high enough. His Akron, Ohio-based
            company's liability insurance won't pay for his defense if he's sued by a client who buys an annuity from a
            company with less than an A rating that later fails, he said. Unlike the Wall Street-backed firms, most of
            the country's largest insurers, such as MetLife Inc. (MET) and New York Life Insurance Co., have ratings of
            A or better. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Annuities can tempt insurers to boost profits by investing aggressively,
            Rybka said. In a typical transaction, a customer hands over her retirement nest egg to an insurance company
            in exchange for a promised future stream of payments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Interests &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer gets to invest the money and keep any earnings beyond what's guaranteed to the
            policyholder. If the bets backfire and the insurance company fails, some losses may be borne by customers
            and state guarantee funds, Rybka said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The long-term interests of policyholders are not
            in alignment with the short-term interests of private equity,' Rybka said. 'It's a heads I win, tails you
            lose game.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the U.S. bank regulatory system is predominantly federal, insurance is
            regulated by state insurance officials, who play dual and sometimes conflicting roles as economic boosters
            and consumer watchdogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;South Carolina is 'among the most business friendly' states,
            according to its commerce department website. Still, it balked when Goldman Sachs wanted to dip into
            policyholders' premiums for funding in the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Transactions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of the largest U.S. securities firms, Goldman Sachs set up an insurance unit in Charleston in
            2004. It joined dozens of companies recruited by Insurance Director Ernst N. Csiszar to establish
            subsidiaries known as 'captives' in the state. Some of them were used to experiment with brand-new types of
            financial transactions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Bermuda was advertising itself as the offshore laboratory of
            insurance,' Csiszar said in a recent interview. 'I said O.K., why don't we become the onshore laboratory?'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Csiszar resigned later that year, replaced by Eleanor Kitzman, founder of an auto
            insurance company in the state. After then Governor Mark Sanford forced Kitzman out of office in 2007, she
            took a job in government relations with Goldman Sachs, and became president of the investment bank's South
            Carolina subsidiary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Reverse Repurchases' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2008, Goldman Sachs
            sought South Carolina's permission to tap the Charleston subsidiary, which had taken on more than $600
            million of assets backing customers' life insurance policies that year, for deals akin to 'reverse
            repurchases' -- short-term influxes of cash to fund Goldman Sachs' trading, according to a person with
            knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity because the unit's investments are confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The evaporation of such funding, in the midst of a financial panic that year, would contribute to
            the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the forced sale of Bear Stearns Cos. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;South
            Carolina rejected Goldman's proposal, and also rescinded an earlier approval for a similar plan, said the
            person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Richardson, South Carolina's insurance commissioner
            at the time, confirmed he rejected a Goldman Sachs proposal. The department had grown stricter since
            Csiszar's tenure, especially after a few of the newly established companies ran into trouble, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When Ernie first started it, of course, it was new. We were sort of the new kid on the block,' he
            said. 'We went out and did some things we probably shouldn't have done.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Move to D.C.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around that time, Goldman Sachs sought help on an insurance matter from the governor's
            office, which refused to intervene, said Scott English, then Sanford's chief of staff. A person close to the
            company said no one in its insurance group recalls the conversation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs soon
            found another way around the South Carolina roadblock: moving to the District of Columbia. 'It is not
            surprising we would choose to relocate to the District of Columbia once South Carolina reversed itself,'
            Goldman Sachs said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like South Carolina, the district was advertising
            itself as a haven for captive insurers such as Goldman Sachs's. Thomas Hampton, the Washington commissioner
            at the time, said Kitzman led talks with him. Hampton said he agreed to allow the investments that South
            Carolina prohibited, after reviewing them with his staff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's arrival 'was
            great,' he said. 'It not only brought revenue here, but payroll taxes and everything else.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kitzman,
            now Texas insurance commissioner, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Global Atlantic &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            D.C., Goldman Sachs borrowed a small amount of money from its insurance unit through the same strategy that
            South Carolina rejected, the firm said in the statement. It said two such trades were secured by assets and
            never amounted to more than 2 percent of its overall insurance portfolio. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs
            is now shutting down its D.C. insurance operation. The unit is a small part of the firm's insurance group,
            known as Global Atlantic. Apart from the D.C. trades, Global Atlantic has always had a 'traditional'
            investing strategy, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two years after Goldman Sachs exited South
            Carolina, Apollo's insurance unit, Athene, arrived. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Athene Unit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Founded
            by billionaires Leon Black, Josh Harris, and Marc Rowan, Apollo decided after the credit crisis in 2008 to
            buy beaten-down bonds and illiquid mortgage-backed securities at distressed prices through an insurance
            company, Rowan said on a conference call last year. Investing policyholders' money alongside its own would
            magnify returns, employing 'a significant amount of leverage,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run by Belardi,
            a Californian who twice competed in Olympic swim trials and had been a top executive at SunAmerica Financial
            Group Inc., Athene took on its first major deal in October 2010, agreeing to acquire Liberty from Royal Bank
            of Canada for about $600 million. Founded in 1919 by a salesman named Frank Hipp, Liberty had its roots
            selling policies to workers in Greenville's textile mills. Hipp's heirs sold the company to RBC in 2000.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Athene agreement was the start of 'rather extensive negotiations' with South
            Carolina insurance regulators, according to Thomas W. Cooper, a retired judge who oversaw the months-long
            approval process. Apollo resubmitted its proposal four times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sufficient Safeguards
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Most of the time was spent trying to get the buyer to satisfy the department that
            there were sufficient safeguards,' Cooper said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene eventually agreed in April 2011
            to limit Liberty's investments in junk-rated securities; to maintain Liberty's capital levels, including by
            contributing more capital if necessary; to submit a quarterly liquidity report; to pay for the department to
            hire an actuary to monitor the company's health; and to appoint three independent directors to the board.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene also said Liberty would 'continue operations in South Carolina.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Less
            than five months later, Athene switched Liberty's legal address to Delaware. Liberty's headquarters remains
            in Greenville, South Carolina, and it does less than 1 percent of its business in Delaware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene
            was in the process of buying a smaller insurer in Delaware, and state officials 'did the right things, we
            thought, as far as encouraging businesses to be there,' Belardi said. 'We wanted one regulator. We liked
            them better.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Delaware Transfer &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a condition of the transfer,
            South Carolina officials insisted that Delaware keep all the conditions that had just been negotiated as
            part of the Liberty takeover unless it hired an outside expert to affirm they weren't necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Delaware did so and dropped some of the conditions, said Nicole Brittingham, an
            insurance department official. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Athene's own internal guidelines are 'stricter than any
            regulator was talking about with us,' Belardi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Athene took over Liberty Life,
            Dodd and the rest of the company's investment team were replaced by a group overseen by Belardi in Manhattan
            Beach, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new group replaced Liberty's conservative portfolio with more
            exotic -- though still mostly highly-rated -- securities. Out went most of Liberty's state and municipal
            bonds, and its mortgage securities backed by government-sponsored firms like Fannie Mae. In came mortgage
            securities without a guarantee. Because they had declined in value when the U.S. housing boom ended, Liberty
            could buy them at a discount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mezzanine Loans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liberty, which
            changed its name last year to Athene Annuity Life Assurance Co., also embraced collateralized debt
            obligations, complicated products backed by pools of assets like mortgages or high-yield loans. In
            commercial real estate, it added mezzanine loans from Tucson, Arizona, to Tampa, Florida, which are the
            first to default if property owners can't pay their debts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lower-yielding bonds from the
            biggest U.S. companies were deemphasized. The new additions included $9 million in securities backed by
            Wyndham Worldwide Corp. timeshare vacation homes in resorts. Plus: $1.2 million in bonds to modernize a
            Soviet-era railroad owned by the Kazakhstan government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Banker Emerges as Barrick Gold Dealmaker</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A week before Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)
            Chairman Peter Munk retires, his successor John Thornton is
            emerging as a dealmaker as the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            banker pursues a bid to combine the two biggest gold miners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Negotiations between Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp. broke
            off last week amid minor disagreements while leaving open the
            possibility that discussions could still resume, two people with
            knowledge of the matter said April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal under discussion would have seen Thornton become
            executive chairman of the combined company while the chief
            executive officer would have been Gary Goldberg, who currently
            leads Newmont, the people said. Toronto-based Barrick's CEO
            Jamie Sokalsky would have led a smaller gold producer spun off
            from the merged company, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed tie-up and its management reshuffle confirm
            Thronton's elevation as Barrick's most senior executive. The 60-year-old, who had no role in the mining
            industry until he joined
            the company's board just over two years ago, is set to succeed
            Munk, Barrick's 86-year-old founder, as chairman at the annual
            shareholders meeting next week. Leading a successful acquisition
            of Newmont (NEM), in what would be the biggest gold takeover, would
            set up Barrick to do further deals, including ones involving
            other commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long-Term Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think if anybody has the skill to drive this
            transaction through, whether or not it is successful from an
            operational standpoint, I think he certainly has the
            leadership,' said Michael Sprung, president of Toronto-based
            Sprung Investment Management Inc., which owns Barrick shares.
            'It's a merger to set them up for bigger, future MA deals
            which may in fact include an element of diversification.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Barrick and Newmont both declined to comment
            on last week's talks. Newmont's shares closed little changed at
            $25.04 in New York, while Barrick rose 1.8 percent to C$19.37 in
            Toronto. Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent to
            $1,284.58 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thornton spent 23 years at Goldman before departing in
            2003. He joined Barrick as an independent director in February
            2012 and was hired as co-chairman in June of that year, just as
            the company fired CEO Aaron Regent following a decline in its
            share price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Slumping gold prices and rising mining costs eroded
            Barrick's margins, raised concerns about its debt and spurred
            the company to start selling higher-cost mines. Those
            divestments have improved the company's financial flexibility
            and will reduce its borrowings, Goldman Sachs said today in a
            note. Goldman raised its recommendation on the stock to buy from
            hold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;McKinsey Review &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of Barrick's senior management, Thornton has helped
            oversee its long-term strategy. He has looked at establishing
            partnerships with Chinese companies including China Investment
            Corp., people familiar with the matter said in December.
            Thornton's role also involves developing and maintaining
            relationships with governments, according to Barrick. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thornton was behind a decision to bring in management
            consultant McKinsey Co. to help evaluate the mining company's
            direction, one of the people said in December. While he sees
            Barrick's top priority to remain as the leading gold producer,
            he's open to rethinking the whole business, which may involve
            acquiring mining assets in other minerals, such as copper, the
            people also said. Barrick already produces copper in Chile and
            Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Spinoff Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We haven't seen him put a stamp on the company yet,'
            said Michael Siperco, a Toronto-based analyst at Macquarie
            Capital Markets. 'Obviously, the combining of Barrick and
            Newmont would be a meaningful step in that direction.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both Barrick and Newmont operate on five continents and
            have a combined market value of about $33 billion. Before talks
            broke off April 18, the companies had agreed to an all-stock
            merger in which Barrick was to offer Newmont shareholders a
            premium of 13 percent more than Newmont's average share price
            over the latest 20 trading days, one of the people with
            knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies had agreed to all terms not related to a
            spinoff of Asia Pacific assets and had identified $1 billion a
            year in cost savings, the people said. The companies, which have
            tried to merge several times in the past, still have interest in
            getting a deal done, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the cost savings would come from Nevada, where
            Barrick and Newmont both produce more than a third of their
            gold. They operate in close proximity in the state, from which
            they originally built out their respective businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Contender &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Sokalsky is a 20-year veteran of Barrick, Thornton
            and Goldberg are both relative newcomers to gold mining at a
            tumultuous time for the industry. Goldberg worked in various
            roles at diversified miner Rio Tinto Group before joining
            Newmont as chief operating officer and became CEO in March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Newmont was considering acquisitions in both gold and
            copper and was adding in-house capacity to assess copper supply
            and demand trends, Goldberg said in a September interview.
            Taking on more copper was a 'logical' step after gold
            companies began to lose the valuation premium that they used to
            attract, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While at Goldman, Thornton was seen as a top contender to
            succeed Henry Paulson as CEO in the early 2000s, according to
            'Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World'
            (2011) by William D. Cohan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Placer Dome &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After leaving the bank, he headed to China, helping to
            start up a business leadership program at Beijing's Tsinghua
            University. He sits on the board of China Unicom (Hong Kong)
            Ltd., the country's second-largest mobile phone carrier, and is
            a member of China Investment Corp.'s international advisory
            board. He's also chairman of the board of trustees of the
            Brookings Institution, where he helped establish the John L.
            Thornton China Center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Munk, a Hungarian immigrant who escaped the Nazis as a
            teenager, founded Barrick as an oil and gas company, later
            shifting his focus to gold. The company expanded through
            acquisitions, with at least 29 completed since 1994, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. Barrick surpassed Newmont as the
            industry leader when it bought Placer Dome Inc. in 2006 for
            about $10.2 billion including net debt, a record for a gold
            takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The ultimate goal is to, in my case, to be the biggest,'
            Munk said at a May 2011 conference organized by Bloomberg in
            Toronto. 'Why would you be happy with halfway?' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Cuts Commodity Outlook as It Exits Bet on Gold Drop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its 'near-term' outlook for commodities and reduced forecasts for
            oil and coffee amid prospects for weak demand from China to Europe. The bank also exited a bet on lower gold
            prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lowered its three- and 12-month return forecasts for the Standard
            Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 commodities to 2.5 percent, from 6 percent in three months and 3 percent in 12
            months, and cut its near-term outlook on commodities to neutral from overweight, according to the report,
            dated today. It exited its bet on lower gold prices, with a potential gain of 10 percent, while saying
            bullion may fall even more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Commodity returns have dropped sharply so far in April as
            weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data releases in the U.S., Europe and China furthered concerns around
            global economic growth,' New York-based analyst Samantha Dart said in the report. 'The negative sentiment in
            the market has weighed on cyclical commodity prices in particular.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The GSCI index slid
            as much as 1.1 percent today as a report showed Chinese manufacturing expanded at a slower-than- expected
            pace, providing more evidence of a pullback in the country's economic growth. Commodities, which touched a
            nine- month low on April 18, are down 6.4 percent this year. Treasuries returned 0.7 percent, according to
            an index calculated by Bank of America Corp., and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 6.1
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Coffee Sinks on Brazil Supplies as Goldman Cuts Price Forecast</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Arabica-coffee futures fell the
            most in seven weeks on speculation that ample supply in Brazil,
            the world's leading producer and exporter, will compensate for
            production losses from a fungal disease in Central America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price forecasts for the
            beans favored by Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), citing improving prospects for
            the 2013 crop in Brazil, the bank's analyst Damien Courvalin,
            said today in an e-mailed report. As of March 31, farmers in the
            South American country sold 75 percent of the most recent
            harvest compared with 86 percent a year earlier, Porto Alegre,
            Brazil-based consulting firm Safras Mercado estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This improving Brazilian production outlook offsets
            additional downward revision to Central American production, on
            damages from the leaf rust fungus,' Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Lose Seven Asia Prime-Brokerage Workers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the
            largest prime broker in Asia, lost seven of its employees on the
            regional team this year, said a person with knowledge of the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The departures include Alain Bordoni, a former managing
            director, and Mark Wittet, who was an executive director, said
            the person, who asked not to be identified as the information is
            private. Most of the jobs vacated have been filled with internal
            transfers and new hires, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the New
            York-based bank, declined to comment. Bordoni's Goldman Sachs
            license was removed Jan. 28, according to information posted on
            the website of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission.
            Wittet's was removed April 5, it showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was ranked by London-based trade journal
            AsiaHedge as the region's largest prime broker, with an
            estimated 179 mandates and $24.6 billion of assets as of April
            2013. Global hedge-fund capital hit $2.7 trillion in March, the
            seventh consecutive quarterly record, according to Chicago-based
            Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the healthy state of the hedge-fund industry, the
            major service providers to hedge funds are likely facing a
            harder time competing for specialized talent, both versus rivals
            as well as versus hedge funds themselves,' said Daniel Celeghin, Asia head at Casey Quirk Associates LLC, a
            Darien,
            Connecticut-based adviser to asset managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime brokers provide services such as stock and cash
            lending, trade clearing for hedge funds, as well as linking them
            with potential investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Joining Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asia-based hedge funds oversee a combined $79.7 billion of
            assets, having recovered by 41 percent from the April 2009
            trough, according to Singapore-based data provider Eurekahedge
            Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks like Goldman Sachs have been trying to balance
            regulatory pressure to tie compensation to long-term performance
            with shareholders' desire for flexibility to cut pay costs, if
            needed. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein cut
            compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the company went public in
            1999 &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the exception of Bordoni, the other Goldman Sachs
            prime-brokerage departures in Asia were executive directors or
            lower-level employees, said the person. Some left to join
            rivals, others have been hired by funds, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bordoni couldn't immediately be reached, while Wittet
            didn't reply to a message seeking comment sent through social
            media. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs counts as its clients some of the largest
            regional hedge funds, including ones led by alumni such as
            Azentus Capital Management Ltd. founded by Morgan Sze. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's 14th annual Asia hedge-fund event in
            Singapore in October attracted the likes of Azentus as well as
            Asia teams of Fortress Investment Group LLC, Och-Ziff Capital
            Management Group LLC and Highbridge Capital Management LLC,
            according to a document seen by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Executives Said to Target $4 Billion for Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett Capital Management
            LP, the investment firm founded by two former Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) executives, plans to raise a new fund matching the $4
            billion gathered in 2012 by its last global special-situations
            vehicle, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett Capital Partners Fund III is targeting a
            first close in the third quarter, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the information isn't public. The firm
            has selected Park Hill Group LLC, the placement agent arm of
            Blackstone Group LP, to help raise money, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett, based in New York, will be joining a
            competitive fundraising market in which private-equity firms are
            vying for a limited pool of investor money. A record 1,949 funds
            were seeking $797.1 billion as of the end of last year,
            according to data by London-based researcher Preqin Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dan Gagnier, a spokesman at Sard Verbinnen Co., declined
            to comment on fundraising plans on behalf of Mount Kellett. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett, which manages about $7 billion, makes
            opportunistic and special-situations investments globally across
            asset classes, industries and geographies, according to the
            firm's website. Special-situations investments typically involve
            companies going through an unusual event such as a spinoff,
            financial restructuring or bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's investments include private equity, corporate
            debt, secured loans, convertible bonds, preferred and common
            shares, real estate and commercial mortgages, according to its
            website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Suntech Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mount Kellett purchased Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg in
            February from hotel operator Accor SA (AC) for 113 million euros
            ($147 million). As of December, the firm was among the largest
            bondholders of Shanghai-based solar manufacturer Suntech Power
            Holdings Co. (STP), which entered bankruptcy last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm took more than a year to raise Fund II, which
            closed in March 2012. The fund was producing a net internal rate
            of return of 0.5 percent and about 70 percent of the money
            raised was invested as of Dec. 31, according to a person briefed
            on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mark McGoldrick and Jason Maynard founded Mount Kellett in
            2008. McGoldrick was co-founder and head of the special-
            situations group at Goldman Sachs from 1997 to 2007. Maynard was
            previously the head of the Asia special-situations business at
            Goldman Sachs. Nick Weber, who leads Mount Kellett's European
            business, also came from Goldman Sachs, where he was co-head of
            the European special situations group. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Elizabeth Arden Said to Hire Goldman to Contact PE Firms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Arden Inc. (RDEN), after
            attracting takeover interest from South Korea's LG Household
            Health Care Ltd., has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to contact
            private-equity firms and other potential buyers, a person
            familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Elizabeth Arden is running a sales process, no deal
            is done and the company may decide not to sell itself, said the
            person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
            private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LG Household, which makes WHOO Hwanyugo skin-care products,
            perfumes and toothpaste, is looking at 'big deals' locally and
            overseas, including one for Elizabeth Arden, Lee In Ick, a
            spokesman for the LG Group unit, said yesterday. Elizabeth
            Arden, based in Miramar, Florida, makes fragrances including
            Elizabeth Taylor and Britney Spears brand perfumes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the Goldman Sachs hiring earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman at New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment. Marcey Becker, a senior vice
            president at Elizabeth Arden, didn't immediately reply to a
            phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Arden shares rose 13 percent to $36 at the close
            in New York, following a 12 percent gain yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Backs Case for Commodity Holdings as Rivals Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
            the case for holding commodities remains strong, bolstering the
            rationale for investments in oil and metals even as other banks
            exit the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities still offer a way to diversify holdings
            together with equities and bonds, and are best suited as a hedge
            against inflation, analysts led by Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday.
            The appeal of holding
            commodities will improve as global growth picks up in the next
            few years, they wrote, without giving a forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While returns from commodities lagged behind those from
            shares and bonds over the past five years, the case for
            retaining an allocation in a portfolio over the long term
            remains, the Goldman analysts wrote. Barclays Plc, JPMorgan
            Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley are leaving parts of their
            commodities businesses, boosting speculation that Goldman will
            be able to increase its market share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Having commodities will be a very useful diversifier for
            most portfolios,' said Jason Wang, chief executive officer at
            Singapore-based Stamford Management Ltd., which had about $300
            million under management at the end of 2013 after returns of
            more than 20 percent from its Iridium Alpha Fund. 'Even within
            commodities, it's so heterogeneous that it's possible to have
            diversification within the sector itself.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Growth in Beta Products After Westpeak Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
            Street bank that once generated millions of dollars in fees from
            its Global Alpha hedge fund, is turning to beta strategies for
            growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which oversees $30 billion
            in such products, agreed this week to buy Westpeak Global
            Advisors LLC, without disclosing terms. Westpeak, which
            supervises just $300 million of assets, can help spur growth in
            the firm's beta products, which are drawing more interest from
            clients, Armen Avanessians, head of GSAM's quantitative
            business, said in an interview. Beta refers to how much an
            asset's price moves in relation to the broader market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While many indexes are weighted based on market
            capitalization, Westpeak develops so-called active beta
            strategies by investing in groups of stocks using other
            characteristics. The idea is to offer the low fees and liquidity
            that have drawn investors to passive exchange-traded funds,
            while providing more value than a proxy for the Standard
            Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anyone who wants to be in the passive space has already
            shifted into that space, and they enjoy a certain degree of
            liquidity and transparency,' said Avanessians, a partner and
            29-year veteran of New York-based Goldman Sachs. 'The question
            is, 'Can they do something more than just slavishly follow the
            market cap?'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which has avoided large mergers throughout
            its history, has made several purchases in the past two years to
            grow an asset-management business that saw outflows in three
            straight years ended in 2012. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in May that he's devoting
            a 'very high
            percentage' of his attention to improving the division's
            performance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Assets Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, assets under supervision topped $1 trillion for
            the first time and pretax profit climbed 20 percent to $1.11
            billion. The division produced $1.57 billion of revenue in the
            first quarter, a 20 percent increase from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avanessians, 54, declined to set a growth target for the
            advanced beta strategies business. He said only that it can get
            'much bigger' and will help the bank attract a bigger slice of
            clients' portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see it as being purely additive to our business,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shut Global Alpha in 2011 as clients pulled
            money from what was the firm's biggest hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;

            Street bank that generates the highest percentage of revenue
            from trading, sold $1.25 billion of five-year, floating-rate
            notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds pay 120 basis points more than the quarterly
            London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. That compares with a spread of 125 basis points for
            $700 million of similar-maturity floating-rate debt that the New
            York-based lender issued in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those securities, rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service and

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            executive Fabrice Tourre lost a bid to bar a recorded 2007 phone
            call from a July 15 trial of U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission claims that he misled investors in a collateralized
            debt obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan today
            rejected Tourre's request to punish the SEC for its delay in
            turning over the Jan. 17, 2007, recording of a call between
            Goldman Sachs saleswoman Gail Kreitman and an employee of ACA
            Management LLC by keeping it out of the trial. The SEC claimed
            that Tourre tricked ACA into becoming the portfolio selection
            agent for the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC said Kreitman falsely told ACA, after talking with
            Tourre, that the hedge fund Paulson Co. planned to take a long
            equity position in the CDO after helping select the assets
            underlying the investment. Tourre knew that Paulson really
            planned to take a short position, betting the value of the CDO
            would drop, the SEC claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a mistake in my mind, and we are going to move
            beyond it,' Forrest told lawyers for Tourre and the SEC in a
            three-hour hearing. 'The Jan. 17 call is going to come in.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre in April 2010. The
            investment bank agreed in July 2010 to pay
            $550 million to settle the allegations against it. Tourre, 34,
            who is studying for a doctorate in economics at the University
            of Chicago, was present in the courtroom today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Set Foreclosure Accord Payments</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) will start sending checks to borrowers foreclosed on by
            the banks' former mortgage-servicing units this week, according
            to the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two New York-based banks will pay $247 million to
            almost 224,000 borrowers, the Fed said today in a statement. The
            checks -- meant to compensate borrowers who may have been
            mistreated in foreclosures during 2009 and 2010 that relied on
            improper documentation or faulty procedures -- range from $300
            to $125,000, depending on the how much harm may have been done. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage units owned by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
            foreclosed on homes of 49 military members eligible for borrower
            protections and three homeowners who weren't in default, the Fed
            said. The loans were handled by Goldman Sachs's Litton Loan
            Servicing LP and Morgan Stanley's Saxon Mortgage Services Inc.,
            both of which were sold to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firms were among 13 of the largest U.S.
            mortgage servicers who agreed to a $9.3 billion settlement with
            federal regulators that called for a total of $3.6 billion in
            cash payments to borrowers and that the rest go to help prevent
            future foreclosures. All borrowers targeted by foreclosure in
            2009 and 2010 are scheduled to get some payment, whether or not
            they were harmed by the banks. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Seen Joined by Deutsche Bank on Apple Offering</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which has been advising Apple Inc. (AAPL) on how to deal with its
            multibillion- dollar cash pile, and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany's biggest lender, are in the lead to
            help the iPhone maker sell bonds for the first time in 17 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple asked the two
            banks, based in New York and Frankfurt, to arrange phone interviews with fixed-income investors today in
            advance of a potential deal, according to a person familiar with the offering who asked not to be identified
            because the terms aren't set. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple, the largest U.S. maker of smartphones, has had
            little need for Wall Street's services since its 1980 initial public offering and its last bond deal in
            1996. Although company co-founder Steve Jobs married a former Goldman Sachs fixed- income strategist, he
            disliked bankers and preferred doing deals without them, according to a former Apple executive who reported
            to Jobs. In 2009, Apple hired Adrian Perica, a Goldman Sachs investment banker, to build a
            mergers-and-acquisitions team. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman's going to be the logical play, but that doesn't
            mean the others aren't going to try,' said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. in New York
            who rates Goldman Sachs's stock outperform. 'If you're one of the big technology players, you're going to
            want to win this thing -- it gives you bragging rights.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for both banks
            declined to comment on whether their firms will lead the bond offering. Steve Dowling, a spokesman for
            Apple, declined to comment beyond the company's remarks announcing the cash plan last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stock
            Buybacks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On April 23, Cupertino, California-based Apple said it would return an
            additional $55 billion in cash to shareholders to compensate for a stock that's dropped on signs that the
            company's growth is slowing. Although it has $145 billion of cash, Apple said it will use debt to help
            finance a total capital reward of about $100 billion to shareholders. By borrowing the money, Apple can
            avoid taxes that would apply should it bring funds back into the U.S. from overseas. More than $102 billion
            of its cash and investments was offshore at the end of March, the company said last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple
            Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, who became CEO in August 2011 when Jobs resigned, hired Goldman Sachs
            after last year's shareholder meeting to help the company improve transparency and governance, including
            what to do with its growing cash pile, according to people familiar with the decision. The firm has helped
            advise Apple's board on ways to return cash to shareholders and respond to hedge fund manager David Einhorn,
            who began publicly demanding action, a person with knowledge of the plans said in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next
            Takeover &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cook limits his appearances at Wall Street investor conferences to Goldman
            Sachs's annual event, held in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank advised Apple on its takeover of
            Next Computer Inc., which was completed in 1997 and led to Jobs's return to Apple, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The company is the top manager of corporate debt issued in the euro region, the data
            show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because investment-grade debt offerings typically pay low fees, banks may offer to
            do the transaction for little or no charge, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is going to be a
            prestige-per-share, not an earnings-per-share, deal,' said Hintz, who worked as Morgan Stanley's treasurer
            and as the chief financial officer at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. earlier in his career. 'We're really
            talking about a deal that's going to be done as close to gratis as you can get.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple
            IPO &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Morgan Stanley was the lead manager of Apple's 1980 initial public offering,
            Goldman Sachs was involved in both of Apple's most recent bond sales in 1994 and 1996. With Apple
            approaching bankruptcy in June 1996, then-CFO Fred Anderson hired Goldman to lead a $661 million convertible
            bond offering that provided the liquidity for Apple's comeback after Jobs rejoined the company as CEO the
            following August, Anderson said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman was 'the preferred banker when
            I was CFO at Apple during 1996 to 2004,' said Anderson, a co-founder of venture capital firm Elevation
            Partners LP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's investment-banking team, led by David Solomon, John S.
            Weinberg and Richard Gnodde, has a higher ranking among advisers on takeovers and stock underwriting than on
            debt underwriting. That's because debt-sale mandates are often awarded to bigger banks that provide
            corporate loans and lines of credit. Yet Apple's cash hoard means it doesn't need any bank loans, making it
            easier to compete for the new bond sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranks first this year among
            managers of debt sales for technology companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs climbed less than 1 percent to $145.11 at the close in New York. Apple advanced 3.1 percent to
            $430.12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Kion Owners Goldman, KKR Said to Line Up Banks for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co. (KKR) and Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) have lined up banks to handle the planned initial public
            offering of Kion Group GmbH, the world's second-largest maker of
            forklifts, said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) was added to the list of financial
            institutions that already includes owners Goldman Sachs and
            KKR's equity capital markets arm as well as Deutsche Bank AG (DBK),
            said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            plans are private. The IPO will probably happen before July if
            markets remain stable and Wiesbaden, Germany-based Kion may sell
            as much as 25 percent of its stock, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forklift maker posted earnings before interest, taxes,
            depreciation, amortization and some items of 747 million euros
            ($977 million) last year. The owners are seeking a valuation of
            about 10 times estimated 2013 Ebitda, according to the people.
            That would lead to a valuation of at least 7.5 billion euros as
            Kion predicts earnings will rise this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion was part of German industrial-gas maker Linde AG (LIN)
            before a 4-billion euro buyout in 2006. Sales increased 8.2
            percent to 4.7 billion euros last year even as global demand for
            industrial trucks dropped by 3.1 percent, as the company
            benefited from orders in China, where Kion is the largest
            overseas forklift-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives for Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, KKR and
            Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Chinese Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa raised $6.8
            billion in IPOs this year, about double the figure for the same
            period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            year's biggest deal was from Germany, where apartment landlord
            LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) raised 1.3 billion euros in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman sold 25 percent of Kion to Weichai Power
            Co., China's biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks, in August to
            help trim debt. Kion also sold 70 percent of its hydraulics unit
            to the Chinese firm. The moves brought Kion 738 million euros in
            investment from Weichai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion trails Toyota Industries Corp. (6201), an affiliate of Toyota
            Motor Corp., in the global forklift market. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Swiss Units Seek Tax Deals</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Swiss units of Goldman Sachs
            Group (GS) Inc. and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among 106 banks seeking U.S.
            non-prosecution agreements after saying they had reason to
            believe they helped Americans violate tax laws, according to
            three people familiar with the banks' actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley applied to a Justice
            Department program that requires banks to disclose how they
            helped Americans hide assets, hand over data on undeclared
            accounts and pay penalties, according to the people who asked
            not to be identified because they weren't authorized to discuss
            the matter publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To gain non-prosecution deals, banks must pay 20 percent of
            the value of accounts not disclosed to the Internal Revenue
            Service on Aug. 1, 2008, 30 percent for such accounts opened
            between then and February 2009 and 50 percent for accounts
            opened afterward. Banks submitted letters of intent by Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Wesley
            McDade, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The voluntary disclosure program, offered last year to more
            than 300 Swiss banks, is part of the U.S. crackdown on offshore
            tax evasion. It wasn't open to 14 institutions already under
            criminal investigation, including Credit Suisse Group AG, the
            second-biggest Swiss bank; the Swiss unit of HSBC Holdings Plc;
            Julius Baer Group Ltd., Switzerland's third-largest wealth
            manager; and Zuercher Kantonalbank, the largest state-owned
            regional bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is considering strategic options for its
            Swiss private bank, including a sale or wind-down, a person
            briefed on the discussions said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Undeclared Accounts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those under criminal investigation are known as Category 1
            banks, while those seeking non-prosecution agreements are called
            Category 2. If no undeclared U.S. accounts are found, banks can
            apply as Category 3. Category 4 banks are those with mainly
            local clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks seeking non-prosecution agreements must disclose the
            total number of U.S. accounts since 2008, their highest dollar
            value, and the employees who managed them. The banks also must
            use independent examiners to certify findings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said in January
            that the department is reviewing the letters of intent to see if
            applicants qualify as Swiss banks. Some banks are still
            reviewing records, and some may withdraw, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least 33 banks announced that they will join the program
            in Category 2, including Cie. Lombard, Odier SCA, Geneva's
            oldest bank, and BSI Group, the Swiss private bank owned by
            Italy's Assicurazioni Generali SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks that said they will participate include: Union
            Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-based bank founded by Edgar de
            Picciotto in 1969; Edmond de Rothschild Group, owned by Baron
            Benjamin de Rothschild; and EFG International AG, controlled by
            Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis and his family. Another 15 banks,
            mainly regional lenders, declared they will opt for Category 3
            or 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Category 3 banks seek Justice Department letters saying
            they're not a target of a criminal probe. In return, an
            independent examiner must confirm the bank broke no laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal earlier reported about the banks'
            participation in the U.S. program. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Vevo LLC's four owners are close to hiring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to explore sale options for the
            music video-hosting service, according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            sale of a majority stake is being considered among those options, according to the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the process is private. Vevo is co-owned by Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, Sony
            Corp. (6758)'s Sony Music Entertainment, Google Inc. (GOOG) and Abu Dhabi Media Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New
            York-based Vevo is weighing offers from DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA), Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA) and
            a joint venture owned by ATT Inc. and Chernin Group, one of the people said. Chief Executive Officer Rio
            Caraeff said in an interview last week that Vevo has been talking to interested investors and has started
            due diligence with a number of companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We want to create more programming, we want
            to launch in more countries, we want to build better products and just generally be a lot bigger than we
            are,' Caraeff said. 'We think the time is right to bring in some new investors to help us achieve that.
            We're starting that ball rolling.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to
            comment, as did Jennifer Press, a spokeswoman for Vevo, and Allison Rawlings, a spokeswoman for DreamWorks
            Animation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Scene Last Night: Women of Goldman, Calvert, BMO Capital</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;'You get ahead -- good reviews,
            promotions -- and at some point you can lean in and have your
            head chopped off,' Barbara J. Krumsiek, chief executive of
            Calvert Investments Inc. said in an interview last night at the
            Financial Women's Association Annual Dinner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a ballroom at the Grand Hyatt, the association honored
            Krumsiek as Private Sector Woman of the Year. She shared the
            dais with the Visionary Woman of the Year, Betsy West, executive
            producer of Storyville Films; the Public Sector Woman of the
            Year, Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation; and
            Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Women are half of the population, they should be half of
            financial services employees, half corporate CEOs and half of
            Congress,' Maloney said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Women from Goldman Sachs Inc., Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Bank of
            Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. and BNP Paribas (BNP) SA, to name a few,
            filled the tables. BMO Capital Markets Corp. matched $25,000 in
            donations made at the event, resulting in $86,000 raised for
            educational scholarships. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of the association's scholarships went to Kamellia
            Saroop who works at BMO. Saroop was unable to attend 'because
            she's working,' said Deirdre Drake, a managing director at the
            firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The association was founded in 1956 by eight women denied
            admission to the Young Men's Investment Association. Today it
            has about 800 members, said Joyce Sullivan, founder and CEO of
            SocMediaFin Inc. and a board member. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Startling Time &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Krumsiek became an association member in 1989, when she was
            around 37. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's the most startling time,' she said. 'You
            accomplish during the meritocracy part of your career, and then
            all of a sudden things aren't working that used to work. You get
            stuck. You realize a career is an obstacle course, not a
            ladder.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of her legacies is helping develop an association
            curriculum called 'Beyond Competence,' about managing
            difficult bosses and subversive subordinates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Topics in high circulation in the room last night -- thanks
            in part to Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's
            book 'Lean In' -- were mentoring and sponsorship. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think mentoring is misunderstood and overrated,'
            Krumsiek said. 'It's a two-way street, it's about helping each
            other. And these relationships can't last an entire career.
            Sometimes you move past your mentors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As for sponsorship: 'If you add value in your company, you
            will be sponsored,' she said. Four out of her seven direct
            reports are women, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Working Revolution &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Excerpts from honoree West's documentary 'Makers: Women
            Who Make America' gave a sense of the revolution that led women
            into the workplace. It featured an interview with Muriel Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New
            York Stock
            Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Min Lu, who works in the audit department at Credit Suisse (CSGN),
            was moved. 'I see how much we take for granted,' Lu said
            during a 'networking break' at the dinner. 'I've been leaning
            in out of personal motivation. Now I feel I have an obligation
            to lean in for the women who fought so hard before me.' &lt;/p&gt;

            commodity trader by sales, hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            metals trader Scott Evans, according to two people with direct

        <headline>Apple Paying $23.9 Million in Fees for Bond Sale Led by Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) paid $23.9 million in
            fees to underwriters led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) for the iPhone maker's $12 billion bond
            offering this week, a year after the banks led its record-setting offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which underwrote 64 percent of the sale
            according to a regulatory filing, would get $15.3 million if
            commissions are divided in proportion to firms' involvement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fees amount to 0.199 percent of the funds raised, down
            from the 0.313 percent charged on the company's $17 billion
            offering last year. The fee is less than half the average 0.461
            percent paid this year on offerings of investment-grade U.S.
            corporate bonds, excluding self-led deals, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank managed 20 percent of the offering, according
            to the filing. That would entitle the Frankfurt-based lender to
            about $4.8 million of a proportionally divided fee pool. Other
            banks in the April 29 deal were JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Bank of
            America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. (C) and Wells Fargo
            Co., the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's share was reduced from 72 percent in last
            April's deal, where it collected about $38.3 million in fees,
            and Deutsche Bank's piece was increased from 17.5 percent,
            according to a filing at the time. Apple maintained the same
            roster of underwriters compared to its last sale, with the
            exception of adding Wells Fargo and dropping Standard Chartered
            Plc. Fees totaled $53.3 million on the 2013 deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Mayura
            Hooper, a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, declined to comment on the
            fees. A call after regular business hours to Ashia Razzaq, a
            spokeswoman at Standard Chartered, wasn't immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>India Rupee Drops on Outflow Concern as Goldman Says Sell Stocks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;India's rupee fell on concern
            outflows from stocks may intensify after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            recommended cutting holdings amid the slowest growth in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India tightened the cash supply last
            month to buoy the rupee and said July 30 the measures will be
            rolled back as the currency stabilizes, leaving its key policy
            rate unchanged the same day. The monetary authority also lowered
            its growth forecast to 5.5 percent for the year through March
            2014 from 5.7 percent. Goldman yesterday cut its rating on
            Indian shares to underweight, and said it sees 'increasing risk
            of a potential flow reversal.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee declined 0.4 percent to 60.58 per dollar as of
            10:18 a.m. in Mumbai, after dropping as much as 0.8 percent
            earlier, according to prices from local banks compiled by
            Bloomberg. The central bank probably sold dollars today to
            support the rupee, according to two traders with knowledge of
            the matter, who asked not to be named as the information isn't
            public. The Indian currency fell 2.5 percent this week and
            touched a record low 61.2125 on July 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Goldman report was a disturbing factor,' said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at Development
            Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB) in Mumbai.
            'Possible RBI intervention is a risk for the exchange rate
            today.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas investors pulled $3 billion from Indian stocks and
            bonds last month on concern the Federal Reserve will pare
            stimulus that drove demand for emerging-market assets. While
            data in the U.S. showed gross domestic product grew more than
            economists estimated in the second quarter, the Fed said
            yesterday persistently low inflation poses a risk. The European
            Central Bank and the Bank of England review interest rates today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
            in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 17 basis points,
            or 0.17 percentage point, to 13.63 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three-month onshore rupee forwards declined 0.1 percent to
            61.98 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts rose 0.5 percent to
            62.07. Forwards are
            agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.

            &lt;p&gt;Russia lenders will try to diversify
            wholesale borrowing away from U.S. and Europe following
            sanctions over Ukraine, Goldman Sachs (GS) says in e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;* Banks will respond to restrictions on their access to
            capital markets with combination of more lending in rubles,
            diversifying into funding from Asia and higher rates on FX
            deposits &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;* Trend to issue outside of dollars already taking place
            with U.S &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Clustered deep beneath the trading floors of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Manhattan headquarters
            are 92 tanks with enough ice for 3.4 million margaritas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman runs chilled
            anti-freeze through pipes connected to the 11-ton vessels during summer nights -- when power costs less --
            to freeze the water. That ice is used the next day in its air-conditioning system, when high-demand
            electricity comes with a surcharge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Proponents of so-called thermal storage systems such
            as Goldman's, which have roots in the New England ice houses of the 18th century, are pushing to expand its
            use. And they see it as a way to help utilities comply with future carbon rules as well as to store power
            from rooftop solar panels or wind farms whose output often surges when demand is low. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A
            Global Push to Save the Planet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'We're going to start phasing out the old coal plants, and
            replacing them with solar, wind and some nuclear power,' said Mark MacCracken, chief executive officer of
            CALMAC Manufacturing Corp., which made Goldman's tanks. 'All of these need to use storage in a big way, and
            thermal storage is the low-hanging fruit.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting thermal storage to take off has been
            a slog, though, as building owners don't want to invest in power savings that will accrue to their tenants,
            and utilities exempt most customers, especially residential ones, from pricing based on peak demand periods.
            Without those pricing cues, government tax breaks or subsidies may be needed to boost the use of ice tanks,
            said Jim Lazar, a utility consultant in Olympia, Washington, who wrote a report on integrating more
            renewables in the electric grid. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Allstate MBS Suit Against Goldman Saches Is Discontinued</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Allstate Corp. (ALL)'s 2011 lawsuit against
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the alleged fraudulent sale of
            residential mortgage-backed securities has been discontinued,
            court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer sued Goldman Sachs in state court in Manhattan
            over the sale of more than $100 million of residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
            including the lost market
            value of the investments. The parties agreed to the suit's
            dismissal, according to a filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allstate, based in Northbrook, Illinois, the largest
            publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, filed similar suits
            against lenders including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc.,
            Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley in the same court, also in
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Justice Eileen Bransten in March denied bids by Morgan
            Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America to dismiss the cases.
            The insurer and Citigroup agreed to a settlement in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allstate said this week that second-quarter profit climbed
            on investment gains and reduced costs tied to natural disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company didn't immediately respond to a voice-mail
            message left on its media line seeking comment on yesterday's
            filing. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment
            on it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investments, pools of home loans securitized into
            bonds, were a central part of the housing bubble that helped
            send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The
            housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and
            investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs Co.,
            652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), this year's
            top-ranked takeover adviser, hired Paul Parker to be a co-chairman of its mergers and acquisitions group
            less than three
            months after he left Barclays Plc. (BARC) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parker, 51, served as global head of finance at London-based Barclays before being named to run the
            worldwide mergers
            and acquisitions in October. He decided to leave in May after a
            reorganization of the bank that prompted the departure of Hugh
            'Skip' McGee, who ran the business in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, Parker will be co-chairman of the MA
            group with Tim Ingrassia and Jack Levy, Michael DuVally, a
            spokesman for the New York-based firm, said yesterday. The post
            is a senior position dealing directly with clients. Gregg Lemkau
            and Gene Sykes are the group's global heads, running the
            business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have been hiring in corporate finance amid a 71
            percent surge in MA to $2.6 trillion this year, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)
            and Citigroup Inc. saw their combined revenue from investment
            banking rise 6.7 percent to $9.17 billion in the first half of
            2014, led by gains in equity underwriting and advising on

        <headline>Drax Rises to Five-Year High After Goldman Upgrade: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Drax (DRX) Group Plc climbed to the highest
            level in almost five years in London as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            added the operator of the largest U.K. coal-fired power station
            to its conviction buy list from a neutral rating previously. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Drax rose as much as 3.8 percent in London to 678.50 pence,
            the highest price since Oct. 9, 2008, as Goldman said U.K. plans
            to pay low-carbon generators fixed subsidies will boost profits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company plans to spend as much as 700 million pounds
            ($1 billion) turning three of the six units at its site in Selby
            to burn biomass by 2016. The first was converted in April, while
            Drax plans to convert a second to burning wood chips by the
            middle of next year and a third in 2016. It spent 106 million
            pounds in the first half on its biomass conversion program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under U.K. plans released in June, power generated from
            converted biomass plants may receive 105 pounds a megawatt-hour. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The new fixed-price subsidies for renewables including
            biomass recently published by the government indicate upside
            potential profits from the current renewable scheme,' Goldman
            analyst Andrew Meads said in a note. Meads increased his price
            estimate by 32 percent to 900 pence, from 684 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Drax rose 2.7 percent to 671 pence by 2.56 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Drax last week said first-half profit slumped 22 percent to
            120 million pounds after a carbon emissions tax was introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company will be 'very different' when it reports its
            first-half 2014 earnings, Mead said. By then two of the three
            units should have been converted. It will also probably decide
            to convert a fourth unit to burn biomass, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Loses Top Brazil Executives as Growth Plan Halted</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank that announced plans in April to hire 50 people in Brazil,
            has reversed course after the economy expanded less than
            analysts estimated and top executives left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The outlook for the economy and equity and merger-and-acquisition deal volumes are worse than we
            expected,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an
            interview on Aug. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index has lost 13 percent since
            the start of April and more than 20 percent this year. Foreign
            banks from Zurich-based UBS AG to London-based Barclays Plc have
            been reducing staff in Brazil as the investment-banking business
            shrinks and competition from local lenders intensifies. Merger
            volume fell to a six-year low this year through July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About a quarter of Goldman Sachs's roughly 45-person Brazil
            investment-banking division have left, people familiar with the
            matter said, asking not to be identified because the bank hasn't
            announced the departures. Five managing directors, four from the
            eight-person executive committee, are no longer at the firm, the
            people said. All of the executive-committee members have been
            replaced, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Yorkshire Water Undervalued by Goldman's Reported Bid, RBC Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Yorkshire Water Services Ltd., a
            supplier to more than 1.9 million households in northern
            England, is undervalued by a 2 billion-pound ($3 billion) bid
            reported in the Sunday Times, RBC Capital Markets LLC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Allianz SE (ALV) for
            a 30 percent stake would represent only a 13 percent premium on
            the utility's regulatory capital value, John Musk, an analyst at
            RBC in London, said today in a note. That 'would appear to be
            low for an MA transaction.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs plans to make a joint bid with German insurer
            Allianz, the London-based Times reported yesterday, without
            saying where it got the information. Citigroup Inc. will sell a
            17 percent stake and MG Investments will divest its 13 percent
            holding, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Allianz declined to comment when
            Bloomberg News called. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the absence of any concrete details of the bid
            package, the implied premium to Yorkshire Water's regulated
            asset value looks at first glance to be slightly on the thin
            side,' said Ian Elkins, editor of Oxford, England-based
            publication Global Water Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While investors are attracted to the steady revenues that
            water assets bring, U.K. utilities are undergoing a regulatory
            shift. Industry watchdog Ofwat last month published changes to
            the way they can charge customers from 2015 to 2020. These
            include separate price controls for wholesale and retail arms to
            spur competition in the retail market by allowing non-household
            customers to choose suppliers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lower Offer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pressure on the selling shareholders to offload their
            stakes before the price review may prompt the prospective buyers
            to offer a lower valuation multiple, Elkins said by e-mail. 'We
            expect this deal to be the last sizeable deal in the regulated
            water utilities space in the U.K. until after the results of the
            next price review are known,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Utilities have until Dec. 2 to submit their business plans
            and Ofwat will make final decisions on prices in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other U.K. water companies have been subject to takeover
            talk. The Daily Mail in April said state-owned Abu Dhabi
            Investment Authority was considering a bid for Pennon Group Plc (PNN),
            while the Times said United Utilities Group Plc (UU/) hired Goldman
            Sachs amid speculation of a possible takeover. Severn Trent Plc (SVT)
            rejected a takeover offer in June, saying it was too low. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The few expected changes to the regulatory regime over
            the next few years do not seem to detract from the
            attractiveness of stable, long-term returns that water
            investments offer investors,' Andrew Cox, KPMG LLP's global
            head of energy and natural resources for transactions and
            restructuring, said today by e-mail. 'There are a limited
            number of such investment opportunities available.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Deutsche Bank Said Near Deal for Buyout Firm</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The private-equity units of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) are nearing an agreement
            to purchase the buyout arm of National Bank of Greece SA,
            according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management and DB Private Equity are in
            talks to pay Greece's largest lender about 300 million pounds
            ($506 million) for NBGI Private Equity Ltd., about a third less
            than the bank originally invested, said the people, who asked
            not to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak
            publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NBGI's management, headed by Chairman and Chief Executive
            Officer Pavlos Stellakis, is in negotiations to remain with the
            London-based unit after the deal is completed, though no final
            decision has been made, two of the people said. The business has
            underperformed similar buyout firms, with 10 of its 11 funds
            projected to lose about 25 euros for every 100 euros invested,
            according to an April document outlining the sale seen by
            Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're in the final stage, but there hasn't been any
            decision,' Dimitris Spyropoulos, a spokesman for Athens-based
            National Bank, said yesterday. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs,
            Deutsche Bank and NBGI all declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Bank, majority owned by Greek taxpayers after a
            8.5 billion-euro bailout last year, is selling assets to boost
            capital before European stress tests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stellakis has presided over the buyout arm for more than a
            decade and received a $3.8 million bonus in 2009 -- the same
            year National Bank got its first state rescue. He has properties
            in London, New York and the south of France, and has had luxury
            cars including a Bentley and two Porsches, Bloomberg previously
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Dibelius and Scherrer to New Industrials Roles</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named Alex Dibelius and Clare Scherrer to new leadership positions at
            a
            unit that provides strategic and financial advice to industrial
            clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dibelius was appointed chairman of the global industrials
            group and Scherrer co-head, alongside Dusty Philip, according to
            an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News, whose contents were
            confirmed by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is No. 3 in global
            industrials deals this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The bank advised on transactions including
            Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP's sale of German energy-metering business Ista International GmbH to CVC
            Capital
            Partners Ltd. in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scherrer, currently chief operating officer of the global
            industrials group, is the third female executive to be promoted
            to a management role at the investment bank this year. The
            others include Kate Richdale, who was named the head of
            investment-banking services in Asia, and Christina Minnis, who
            last month was appointed co-head of healthcare Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dibelius is currently co-head of the global industrials
            group and has overall responsibility for the firm's business in
            Germany, Austria, and Central and Eastern Europe, the memo says. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which gets
            the largest share of revenue from trading among U.S. banks,
            promoted sales executive Stacy Bash-Polley to expand its
            relationships with those clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bash-Polley, 45, will take on a newly created role as head
            of client relationship management and strategy in the Americas,
            according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.
            Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the New York-based firm,
            confirmed the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, has been
            trying to win market share from rivals that are pulling back
            from trading businesses amid revenue declines and higher capital
            requirements. Goldman Sachs's trading revenue fell 12 percent in
            the first half of the year, the fifth consecutive first-half
            decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bash-Polley is currently head of sales for all U.S.
            interest-rate, currency, mortgage and emerging-market products.
            In her new role, she'll oversee the firm's institutional client
            group, which is run by Valentino Carlotti, and will report to
            Tom Cornacchia, 51, global head of fixed-income, currency and
            commodity sales, and Paul Russo, the co-head of the firm's
            equities-trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She currently manages the bank's trading relationship with
            BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's largest asset manager. Richie Prager, head of trading and liquidity
            strategies at New York-based BlackRock, credits her with changing the interaction
            between the two firms from transactional to a more strategic
            bond. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Iron Ore Rout in 2015 as Supply Growth Quickens</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore will extend a drop through
            2015 when an increase in seaborne supply that's spurred a global
            glut is set to accelerate, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the expansion in supply will probably moderate in the
            second half of 2014, the trend rate of growth in seaborne
            cargoes exceeds demand by a ratio of three to one, the bank said
            in a report dated today. Goldman kept its forecast for the
            steelmaking raw material at an average of $80 a metric ton in
            2015 from $106 this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices have tumbled 29 percent in 2014 as companies from
            Rio Tinto Group to BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) increased output, betting
            higher volumes will more than offset falling prices. Deutsche
            Bank AG and Morgan Stanley see lower rates through 2016.
            Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. has said it's completed a $9.2
            billion expansion to boost annual output to 155 million tons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The shift to oversupply started barely six months ago and
            the adjustment phase is far from over,' said Goldman analysts
            Christian Lelong and Amber Cai. 'Seaborne supply is set to
            accelerate again in 2015 while Chinese steel production growth
            slows further.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Tianjin increased
            0.4 percent to $95.90 a dry ton today, according to data from
            The Steel Index Ltd. Prices entered a bear market in March and
            dropped to $89 on June 16, the lowest level since September
            2012. China buys 67 percent of global seaborne supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Labor Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While mining companies plan to boost shipments, a labor
            dispute over leave and wages threatens to disrupt cargoes at
            Australia's Port Hedland, the world's largest bulk terminal.
            Tugboat engineers intend to strike for four hours each on Aug.
            9, Aug. 11 and Aug. 13, says Teekay Shipping (Australia) Pty,
            which is contracted by BHP Billiton Ltd. to tow vessels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The action would mean that 'half of the day's shipping is
            lost,' Ian Roper, a Singapore-based analyst at CLSA Ltd., said
            by phone, estimating the strike would disrupt about 2.2 million
            tons of supply. 'That's not a great amount. Fundamental wise,
            there's still an awful lot of supply.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortescue and BHP estimate such a disruption may cost users
            about $93 million a day. Port Hedland shipments made up 55
            percent of Australia's total ore exports last year and about a
            quarter of global seaborne trade, Bloomberg calculations based
            on Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics data show. Iron ore
            is the country's biggest export earner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Tide &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given the short duration of the stoppages and the glut, the
            strike will probably not materially impact the seaborne market
            or prices, Morgan Stanley said in a report today. If conducted
            at high tide, each four-hour stoppage could affect as much as
            500,000 tons, or 1.5 percent of monthly volumes, analysts
            including Joel Crane said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The outlook from Goldman contrasts with the view from
            Westpac Banking Corp.'s senior economist Justin Smirk, who said
            prices will rally and peak at $123 in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are likely to see softer near-term growth in ore
            supply overall as Chinese and other sources of ore moderate
            production,' Smirk wrote in a report today. 'Any near-term
            upside surprise in demand will be a positive for prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore rose in July for a second straight month on
            speculation that China's demand for imports was improving,
            helping to absorb a global surplus as local supplies in the
            largest buyer are displaced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. predicted a dramatic recovery in
            prices in second half, saying that it's now cheaper for steel
            mills in China to buy seaborne supply rather than domestic
            material. Citigroup Inc. said in June prices will rebound as the
            daily closure of mines supplying high-cost output in China
            boosts demand for seaborne shipments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Hires Goldman Currency Co-Head as Managing Director</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, the world's biggest
            currency trader, said it hired Gaurang Chadha as a managing
            director in its North American foreign-exchange investor sales
            team in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chadha was co-head of foreign-exchange hedge fund sales for
            the Americas at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he worked for
            five years, according to a Deutsche Bank statement. Chadha, who
            was also employed at Citigroup Inc. and ABN Amro Bank NV, will
            report to Liza Duke and Daniel Swasbrook, co-heads of investor
            sales, North America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Themes in the market have been supportive of our business
            franchise this year, specifically the interest in Japan and the
            strong dollar story as macro themes that people have gotten
            behind,' Hans Ephraimson, managing director and head of foreign
            exchange, commodities and short-duration sales for the Americas
            at Deutsche Bank in New York, said in a telephone interview.
            'Gaurang's expected contribution, and hires like this, are much
            longer lasting than any one interim-year increase in flow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yen has fallen 10 percent this year against the
            greenback. The dollar has rallied against 13 of its 16 most-traded peers during that span. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency trading volumes in the U.S. and U.K. rose to
            records in April, according to the Foreign Exchange Committee's
            twice-yearly survey. The average-daily-volume of U.S. currency
            trading rose 27 percent since October to $1 trillion, the
            committee said July 29 in a statement. U.K. volume rose 26
            percent to $2.55 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Bank Hires Goldman Sachs Banker as Australia CEO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) hired James McMurdo
            from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as chief executive officer for its
            Australian and New Zealand business to replace John Macfarlane,
            who retires in early 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McMurdo was most recently a partner at Goldman Sachs in
            London, where he headed the financial sponsors group for Europe,
            the Middle East and Africa. He will report to Gunit Chadha and
            Alan Cloete, co-chief executive officers for the Asia-Pacific
            region, Deutsche Bank said in an e-mailed statement. McMurdo's
            appointment is effective from February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is on course to finish outside the top three
            for advising on mergers and acquisitions in Australia and New
            Zealand for a third straight year, ranking ninth in 2013,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Frankfurt-based
            bank is the fifth-biggest arranger of bond deals in Australia,
            trailing the four largest domestic lenders, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'James McMurdo is one of the most respected bankers in
            this key growth market for Deutsche Bank,' Chada said in
            today's statement. 'He brings great depth of experience to this
            important role and is best suited to help grow our strong
            position across all our client businesses.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Slowing MA &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australian MA volume dropped 31 percent this year from the
            same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as the
            fading mining boom sapped the economy and consumer confidence.
            The government on Aug. 2 cut its growth estimate for the year
            ending June 2014 to 2.5 percent from 2.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Turkish Bonds and Lira Drop as Goldman Says Economy Vulnerable</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Turkey's benchmark yields climbed for
            the first time in five days and the lira depreciated against the
            dollar as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said pressure on the economy
            may continue given the nation's external imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on two-year benchmark notes rose 16 basis points, or
            0.16 percentage point, to 8.83 percent at the close and the
            Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100) index fell 0.7 percent. The lira
            weakened 0.3 percent to 1.9317 per dollar, the lowest since Aug.
            1, at 12:42 p.m. in Istanbul. Turkish Markets closed at 12:40
            p.m. local time and will reopen Aug. 12 as the nation celebrates
            Eid, which marks the end of the Islamic month of fasting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Turkish economy may have to go through a significant
            adjustment as the U.S. economy continues to normalize over the
            next couple of years,' Ahmet Akarli, a London-based economist
            at Goldman Sachs, said in a report dated yesterday. The
            adjustment may come 'through a combination of a weaker exchange
            rate, as well as higher domestic rates,' he said, citing the
            economy's shortfall, a source of 'vulnerability.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The current account deficit widened an annual 42 percent to
            $7.52 billion in May, according to central bank data published
            last month. The gap may reach 6.9 percent of gross domestic
            product in 2013, up from 6.04 percent last year, according to
            the median estimate of 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Re-appreciation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two-year yields have surged 404 basis points, or 4.04
            percentage points, from a record low of 4.79 percent on May 17.
            The lira has weakened 7.7 percent against the dollar this year,
            the biggest decline after South Africa's rand among emerging
            markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We may see a partial re-appreciation in the lira, with
            perceptions of inflation turning positive this month,' Inanc Sozer, an economic-research manager at Odea
            Bank AS, the Turkish
            unit of Lebanon's Banque Audi SAL-Audi Saradar Group, said in e-mailed comments today. 'If food prices
            remain subdued,
            inflation in August might even drop to 7.5 percent,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Annual inflation in July rose to 8.88 percent, the highest
            level since September, from 8.3 percent the previous month,
            according to data released by the statistics office this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Core inflation, which strips out energy, food, beverages,
            tobacco and gold, accelerated to 6.09 percent from 5.57 percent
            in June, the largest monthly pickup since October 2011.
            Publication of this month's inflation data is scheduled for
            Sept. 3. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;3i Group Plc (III), the U.K.'s oldest
            private-equity firm, has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to
            advise on a potential sale of Agent Provocateur Ltd., a person
            familiar with the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3i has appointed the investment bank to find a buyer for
            the lingerie retailer, which is expected to fetch about 200
            million pounds ($336 million), said the person, who asked not to
            be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Agent Provocateur is projected to generate earnings before
            interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about 14
            million pounds this year, the person said, up from 6.2 million
            pounds on revenues of 39 million pounds for the year ending in
            March 2013, according to filings at the U.K.'s Companies House. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3i bought a majority stake in Agent Provocateur in November
            2007 in a deal that valued the company at about 60 million
            pounds. The luxury lingerie maker was founded in 1994 and has
            stores or franchise partners in 31 countries globally, according
            to 3i's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for 3i declined to comment, and spokesmen for
            Agent Provocateur and Goldman did not immediately respond to
            telephone and e-mail requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Cooperating With U.S. Credit-Swaps Inquiry</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it's cooperating with
            the U.S.
            Department of Justice's four-year-old antitrust probe into the
            credit-default swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm has received civil investigative demands related
            to the investigation, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
            regulatory filing today. The bank was among more than a dozen
            financial institutions accused by the European Union last month
            of colluding to curb competition in credit derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. also said in filings last
            week that they were cooperating with the probe. The Justice
            Department sent civil investigative notices in July 2009 to the
            banks that own London-based Markit Group Ltd., a provider of
            data on derivatives and bonds, to find out if they had unfair
            access to price information, three people familiar with the
            matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markit's shareholders included Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), Bank of America Corp., and Royal Bank of Scotland
            Group Plc, according to filings with the U.K.'s Companies House
            at the time. Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News, competes
            with Markit in selling information to the financial-services
            industry. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Lost on Six Days in Second Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
            posted losses from that business on six days in the second
            quarter, unchanged from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's traders made more than $100 million on 10 days
            in the quarter ended June 30, compared with four days in the
            year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
            regulatory filing today. While the largest one-day loss was
            between $75 million and $100 million, none of the firm's losses
            topped its value-at-risk estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $4.31 billion from its trading
            division in the second quarter of 2013, an increase of 11
            percent from the year-earlier period. The total was down from
            the first quarter amid a drop in bond prices sparked by
            indications that the Federal Reserve may ease economic-stimulus
            measures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Macro concerns emerged again toward the end of the
            quarter and were reflected in lower activity levels and risk
            appetite in certain businesses,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a conference call last
            month. 'In addition,
            the market volatility created more challenging periods within
            the capital markets for managing client flows.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. lost money on seven days during the
            quarter, including a $54 million misstep on one of them. Morgan
            Stanley posted losses on 12 days, including one that topped $50
            million, while Wells Fargo Co. reported five negative days.
            Citigroup Inc. doesn't disclose money-losing days. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's European Insurance Business Up for Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it probably will sell a majority stake in its European insurance
            business in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent capital rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rothesay Life
            Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, had $9.66 billion in assets as of
            June 30, Goldman Sachs said today in a regulatory filing. The New York-based bank sold about 80 percent of
            Global Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in Bermuda, to institutions and high-net worth
            clients in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is planning the sale of Rothesay, which it set up in
            2007, in part because new rules require banks to hold more equity to absorb potential losses on their
            assets, according to a person briefed on the discussions. The sale of Global Atlantic boosted Goldman
            Sachs's Basel III Tier 1 common ratio by 0.5 percentage point, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said
            last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our reinsurance business -- good business, we like the business -- but with
            the new Basel rules it was clear that business was better held outside of Goldman Sachs,' Schwartz, 49, said
            at an investor conference in May. 'If something's better outside of Goldman Sachs, we'll make an
            adjustment.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pension Hedging &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Tier 1 common equity
            was equal to 9.3 percent of the bank's risk-weighted assets at the end of June under new Basel III rules,
            according to the filing. The bank has said it wants to maintain a ratio of about 9.5 percent, or 1
            percentage point higher than regulators will require. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm's Tier 1 common equity
            was reduced by $9.87 billion because of investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions, according to
            the filing. That brought its Basel III figure to $55.8 billion, compared with $61.9 billion under current
            rules. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures more than 10 billion pounds ($15.5 billion) of pension
            liabilities for companies including IAG SA's British Airways and General Motors Co.'s U.K. division. Firms
            such as Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a certain age and then use derivatives to
            try to hedge the risk. The insurer typically receives a portion of the pension plan's assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothesay had pretax operating profit of 266 million pounds in 2012, according to the unit's
            website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Greek Derivative &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The unit's assets included corporate
            bonds, non-U.S. government debt and $1 billion of over-the-counter derivatives, according to the filing. The
            business had $10.6 billion of liabilities as of June 30. The total asset and liability figures exclude
            inter-company assets and liabilities, which are expected to be included in the sale, according to Goldman
            Sachs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loudiadis, 50, who joined Goldman's European derivatives marketing group in 1994
            from JPMorgan Chase Co. and was named partner in 2000, rose to be one of the bank's top European sales
            executives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2001 she helped sell Greece a derivative that masked the country's
            growing debt so the country could improve its finances to meet European Union fiscal targets. The derivative
            later cost Greece billions of euros. Goldman Sachs wasn't accused of wrongdoing related to the transaction.

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank Said to Fund Debt on 650 Madison</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche
            Bank AG (DBK) are funding the acquisition of New York's 650 Madison
            building with an $800 million loan, according to two people with
            knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lenders plan to package the debt on the Manhattan tower
            into bonds to sell to investors, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the negotiations are private. A $150
            million portion may be carved into riskier mezzanine loans that
            pay higher yields, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal signals Wall Street's conviction that bond buyers
            will snap up the commercial-mortgage backed securities even as
            concern that the Federal Reserve may begin to reduce stimulus
            efforts next month roils markets. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche
            Bank beat out Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
            Chase Co. and Wells Fargo Co. to land the assignment,
            according to four people with knowledge of the talks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Amanda Williams of Deutsche Bank, both in New
            York, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A partnership between Crown Acquisitions and Highgate
            Holdings Inc. agreed to pay a record $1.3 billion, or $2,100 a
            square foot, for the tower at Madison Avenue and East 59th
            Street in June. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) and Oxford Properties Group
            have joined the consortium of buyers, Vornado Chairman Steven Roth said on an Aug. 6 conference call with
            analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase, from Carlyle Group LP, is the largest for an
            entire building in the U.S. since Google Inc.'s $1.8 billion
            acquisition in 2010 of 111 Eighth Ave., a former warehouse in
            Manhattan's Chelsea section. It exceeds the record $1,583 a
            square foot paid for 450 Park Ave. in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have arranged $49.1 billion of bonds
            linked to everything from strip malls to skyscrapers this year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance is forecast to
            climb to $70 billion in 2013, more than double last year's
            total, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former Goldman Sachs Managing Directors Plan Asia Hedge Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Three former managing directors of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Japan business plan to start an
            Asia multi-strategy hedge fund early next year, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Koji Gotoda and Takayuki Kasama have incorporated Golvis Investment Pte in Singapore, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private. The fund will invest in all asset
            classes with an initial focus on Japan, they added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Japan-focused hedge funds have
            historically traded stocks, making a company staffed by a large team of former Goldman Sachs employees and
            capable of investing in multiple asset classes a rarity, one of the people said. The New York-based bank,
            once Wall Street's most profitable securities firm, generated about half of its revenue from trading last
            quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The pedigree of the principals will guarantee they at least get a good hearing
            from prospective allocators,' Peter Douglas, principal of Singapore-based GFIA Pte, which advises on
            hedge-fund investments. 'After many years of slow death or exile for the Japanese hedge fund industry, it
            does feel as if the industry, like the country, could be on the verge of a renaissance.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gotoda
            most recently led Asia convertible bond trading at Goldman Sachs before leaving in July, said the other
            person. Kasama, a former co-head of Japan credit trading, left the New York-based bank in June. Both were
            among 272 promoted to managing directors in 2009, according to an internal memo at that time. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Expertise Can't Help Momentum Funds Gain Momentum</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;There are simple exchange-traded
            fund strategies ('buy gold') and more-ambitious exchange-traded fund strategies ('dynamically allocate
            across a basket
            of assets based on historical price momentum and volatility.') &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ALPS Distributors Inc. offers simple ETFs like the U.S. Oil
            Fund (strategy: buy oil, basically) as well as the more-ambitious varieties, such as those of the
            dynamically allocating
            persuasion. Except investors weren't allocating funds to those
            ambitious ETFs in a dynamic fashion, even though they were
            advertised as a way to gain 'access to Goldman Sachs'
            expertise.' As a result ALPS is euthanizing them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So here is their obituary: The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder
            Index ETF series, an ambitious group of securities that
            attempted to outsmart the market by licensing Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. strategies based on historical price momentum,
            volatility and correlation, died this month after a lifelong
            battle with investor disinterest. They were less than 2 years
            old. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;None of the four ETFs has more than about $3.4 million in
            assets. While not all of them performed terribly, neither did
            they perform, uh, dynamically. Which is kind of sad, really, if
            you believe in old-fashioned notions like the powers of math and
            that the biggest brains on Wall Street can outfox the mailman
            who puts his whole 401(k) into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wet Screens &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now, some may shake their fists in the air and curse at a
            market perceived to be hypnotized into marching in a straight
            line by the magic wand of the Federal Reserve. And maybe that's
            a fair reaction, but at the end of it all you're left with is
            tired fist and maybe some spittle on three or four of your
            computer screens. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's what the back of the baseball cards would
            look like for the Goldman-inspired funds (for comparison, note
            that the SP 500 -- arguably not the best benchmark to compare
            each of these to, but let's do it anyway -- has returned about
            40 percent including dividends since these ETFs started trading
            in December 2012): &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;*The ALPS/GS Risk-Adjusted Return U.S. Large Cap Index ETF (GSRA)
            did the best since inception, returning 38 percent, less than
            the 41 percent gain in the Russell 1000 Index from which it
            picks its stocks. Selection criteria included average analyst
            price estimates adjusted by volatility, with sectors showing
            lower anticipated risk getting a higher allocation. Its expense
            ratio is 0.55 percent, compared with 0.15 percent for the
            iShares Russell 1000 ETF. Top holdings: Pharmacyclics Inc.,
            Cameron International Corp., Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and
            Madison Square Garden Co. (Goldman's risk modelers are,
            presumably, not Knicks fans.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Baseball Cards &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Multi-Asset Index ETF (GSMA)
            returned 9.5 percent since inception and had an expense ratio of
            0.68 percent. This is an 'ETF squared' since it only holds
            four other ETFs tracking real-estate, emerging markets stocks,
            Treasuries maturing in more than 20 years and Latin American
            equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Growth Markets Equities and
            U.S. Treasuries Index ETF. This baseball card will not be a
            collector's item: the fund has returned negative 11 percent
            since inception. It holds ETFs tracking stocks in India, Brazil,
            Turkey and Indonesia and just a dash (0.2 percent) of long-maturity Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Asia ex-Japan and U.S.
            Treasuries Index ETF lost 2.7 percent on a total-return basis
            since inception. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'On consideration of current market conditions, as well as
            prospects for growth in the funds' assets, the board determined
            that it was in the best interests of the funds and their
            shareholders to liquidate the funds' shares,' ALPS said
            yesterday in statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For sure, the ALPS/GS offerings aren't the only momentum
            funds struggling to catch lightning in a bottle from past high-flying stocks. The $12.4 million SPDR SP 1500
            Momentum Tilt ETF (MMTM)
            has returned 42 percent since its inception in 2012, which is
            pretty sweet but not as sweet as the almost 44 percent return
            for the SP 1500 itself. Neither have the $313 million iShares
            MSCI USA Momentum Index ETF or the AQR Momentum Fund blown the
            doors off large, mid and small-cap benchmarks since their
            inceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 16 U.S. momentum ETFs have a total of $3.7 billion in
            assets yet have only taken in $57 million this year, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lesson to take away, if it's not obvious by now, is
            that catching lightning in a ETF jar is not easy no matter how
            dynamically you allocate. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Hire EU Bank Specialist From U.K. Treasury</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired
            European financial policy specialist Martina Garcia from the
            U.K. Treasury, according to a person with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Garcia will become the firm's only Brussels-based employee
            when she starts in September, said the person, who declined to
            be identified because the appointment has not been made public.
            Garcia is currently a deputy director in the Treasury's
            financial services group with responsibility for developing
            policy on European Union banking reform and financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission and European Council are based in
            Brussels, making it the main center for originating and
            discussing financial rules in the 28-nation bloc. The EU
            agencies are in the process of overhauling banking and
            securities markets rules, from derivatives trading to bonuses
            and capital requirements, in a series of reforms that began in
            2010 after the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Garcia will report to Martine Doyon, the bank's head of
            government affairs for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said
            the person. Doyon also joined Goldman Sachs from a public role,
            leaving Britain's Financial Services Authority in 2011 to head
            the bank's EU government affairs department. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials for the Treasury and Goldman Sachs declined to
            comment. Garcia didn't return a call to her office. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Lowe's Said to Hire Goldman to Find Brazil Acquisitions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lowe's Cos. (LOW) is seeking acquisitions
            in Brazil, two people with knowledge of the matter said, in a
            move that would help it penetrate a fragmented industry to take
            advantage of a growing pool of home owners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lowe's is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as it
            searches for targets, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified discussing private information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Options for the Mooresville, North Carolina-based company
            include buying part of BR Home Centers, the home-improvement
            holding company valued at about 500 million reais ($220.1
            million) that is working with Rothschild to study strategic
            options, one of the people said. Also exploring a sale is
            Curitiba-based Balaroti Materiais de Construcao SA, which is
            working with Morgan Stanley, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Lowe's and rival Home Depot Inc. have built a
            presence in Mexico, the U.S. construction-materials super stores
            have yet to expand into most of Latin America. An acquisition in
            Brazil would have Lowe's entering a market where the formal
            home-improvement industry still competes with corner hardware
            stores, even as rising incomes present compelling prospects for
            sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although economic growth is slowing this year, retailers
            still see a market in which tens of millions of Brazilians
            entered the middle class in the past decade. The government has
            also encouraged home ownership with its low-income housing
            initiative dubbed Minha Casa, Minha Vida -- or My Home, My Life
            -- which has delivered more than a million homes, with more on
            the way. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Construdecor Stake &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, Santiago, Chile-based SACI Falabella bought a
            majority stake in Brazilian home-improvement chain Construdecor
            SA, which runs stores under the Dicico brand, for 388 million
            reais ($171 million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lowe's, Balaroti, Goldman Sachs and BR Home Centers
            declined to comment. Morgan Stanley and Rothschild didn't
            respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lowe's is the second-largest home-repair retailer in the
            U.S., with $53.4 billion in revenue last year, behind Home
            Depot's $78.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both companies missed estimates for same-store sales in the
            first quarter as a harsh, prolonged winter forced people to put
            off renovations. &lt;/p&gt;

            Financial Services AG through the credit crisis and became
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s lead independent director, has died.
            He was 68. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He died on Aug. 13, according to an e-mail sent today to
            employees of New York-based Goldman Sachs by Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn. Schiro
            died of multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, at his home in
            Princeton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2002, Schiro became CEO of Zurich Financial Services,
            which had been the worst-performing European insurance stock the
            previous year. Under his leadership, the company returned to
            profitability, and Barron's magazine included him in its Top CEO
            list in 2008 and 2009. The company, Switzerland's biggest
            insurer, changed its name to Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following his retirement from Zurich Financial in 2009,
            Schiro joined Goldman Sachs's board and in 2012 was named lead
            director and chairman of the Corporate Governance, Nominating
            and Public Responsibilities Committee, according to the bank's
            biography. He retired last month to undergo medical treatment
            for his disease. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jim was an outstanding board member and an exceptional
            individual who made an invaluable contribution to our firm and
            to all those who worked with him,' Blankfein and Cohn wrote.
            'We will remember him for his unfailing commitment to Goldman
            Sachs and to our shareholders and for the example he set as a
            leader and mentor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Navigate Uncertainties' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He also served as a director at PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), based in
            Purchase, New York, and Royal Philips Electronics NV, located in
            Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jim will be remembered as one of the finest business
            leaders of our generation,' Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, said
            today in an e-mailed statement. 'He could see beyond the
            horizon and set a vision for the future, yet he also had the
            discipline, focus and agility to navigate uncertainties along
            the way. He was as respected for his knowledge and intellect as
            he was for his character and integrity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James J. Schiro was born on Jan. 2, 1946, in Brooklyn, New
            York, one of two children born to Joseph and Mary Schiro. He
            attended a local school, St. John's University, on a scholarship
            from the Knights of Columbus and Citibank, graduating in 1967.
            He received a master's in business administration from Dartmouth
            University, according to the Goldman Sachs (GS) biography. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 1967 Schiro joined Price Waterhouse and held various
            positions, including managing partner of the New York office
            from 1991 to 1995. He rose to chairman of Price Waterhouse and
            when the firm merged with Coopers Lybrand in 1998, he served
            as CEO of New York-based PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, one of the
            world's four biggest accounting firms. He retired in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Survivors include his wife of 46 years, Tomasina; their

        <headline>Cantor Hires Two From Goldman Sachs for Currency Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cantor Fitzgerald LP hired two
            former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. salesmen for its foreign-exchange group in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joseph Pinto, previously head of Americas electronic
            foreign-exchange sales at Goldman, was hired as a senior
            managing director, and Stephan McElreath, a Goldman vice
            president of foreign-exchange sales, was hired as vice
            president, Cantor said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two were added to boost market-making operations and
            will report to James Reilly, senior managing director and global
            head of foreign-exchange sales and trading, said the brokerage
            run by Howard Lutnick. Cantor is one of 22 primary dealers that
            trade with the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the things I've been tasked with in my remit is
            basically to build out a number of different capabilities,'
            Reilly said in a phone interview. 'That includes our electronic
            footprint, that includes our voice-agency execution business and
            obviously that includes our trading business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign-exchange volumes have dropped amid policies by the
            biggest central banks that have depressed volatility and as
            officials around the world probe trading activity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's an opportunity for us as a full-scale institution,'
            Reilly said. 'Where maybe some of the smaller market
            participants who can't weather what is just a bad year are
            having troubles, and where some of the larger market
            participants who have maybe been caught up in headlines around
            the world, we find ourselves building out a longer-term
            vision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average daily currency turnover in North America was $811.1
            billion in April, a 20 percent drop from a record $1 trillion in
            April 2013 and a 0.6 percent decline from October, the Fed-sponsored Foreign Exchange Committee said last
            month, citing a
            twice-yearly survey. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Drops Bid to End Libyan Wealth Fund Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) abandoned
            its bid to get a U.K. court to throw out a $1 billion lawsuit by
            the Libyan Investment Authority that alleged the New York-based
            bank made about $350 million selling it investments that turned
            out to be worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had asked a London judge in April to decide
            that the case didn't have a realistic chance of success and to
            issue a so-called summary judgment dismissing the suit, the
            sovereign wealth fund said in a statement today. The bank has
            withdrawn the request, LIA said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'application was misconceived and issued purely for
            tactical reasons, including a desire to delay the determination
            of the LIA's claims,' the fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libya's sovereign wealth fund is one of dozens of small
            companies and government agencies that have sued lenders over
            deals the investors claim were too complicated to understand. It
            also sued Societe Generale SA (GLE) in a $1.5 billion lawsuit, saying
            that the French bank paid about $58 million to a friend of the
            Qaddafi family to secure investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to believe this case is entirely without
            merit and intend to contest it vigorously as it moves through
            the legal process,' Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A London court hearing is scheduled to take place in early
            October, the fund said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is: The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman
            Sachs International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice,
            Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Credit Sales Co-Head Shaffer to Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;John Shaffer, a former Penn State
            University quarterback who's spent more than two decades on Wall
            Street, is departing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as co-head of New
            York credit sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shaffer, 49, will leave at the end of the year after
            joining in 2007 as a managing director, according to an internal
            memo obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by Tiffany Galvin,
            a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Avanish Bhavsar, head of cross-asset sales, and Jon Meltzer, who's now co-head of investment-grade,
            high-yield and
            municipal bond sales, will become co-heads of U.S. credit sales,
            according to another internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has shuffled its sales leadership as trading
            revenue fell 12 percent in the first half of the year, the fifth
            consecutive first-half decline. The New York-based firm this
            month named Stacy Bash-Polley, 45, to lead management of its
            client relationships across trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meltzer and Bhavsar, who will also continue to oversee
            cross-asset sales, will report to Tom Cornacchia, 51, global co-head of sales for fixed-income, currency and
            commodities.
            Salespeople typically call on trading clients to pitch products
            and ideas and help manage orders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;National Championship &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shaffer, who previously worked at Merrill Lynch Co. for
            17 years, was known to customers and traders partly because of
            his background as a football player for Penn State. In 1986, he
            quarterbacked the team to a 12-0 season, winning the national
            championship with a 14-10 victory over the University of Miami
            in the Fiesta Bowl in January 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said that playing on the team under Joe Paterno was
            tougher than working on Wall Street, according to an October
            2011 article. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That pressure, that competition I tried to replicate on
            Wall Street, but I just couldn't,' he said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He joined Goldman Sachs as head of the high-yield and
            distressed sales group and was named to his current role in
            2012, according to one of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Shaffer was promoted to partner, Goldman Sachs's
            highest rank, in a nod to its history as a private partnership
            before going public in 1999. Meltzer and Bhavsar were also named
            partners four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the fourth-most active underwriter of U.S.
            corporate bonds this year, up from fifth last year, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(An earlier version of this story corrected the spelling of
            Merrill Lynch.) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Goldentree to Acquire 144 U.K. Travelodge Hotels</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Goldentree
            Asset Management LP and Avenue Capital Group LLC, which acquired
            Travelodge Hotels Ltd. in a debt restructuring in 2012, agreed
            to buy 144 U.K. hotels leased to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hotels, located in London and southeast England, are
            owned by Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), Prestbury Investment Holdings
            Ltd., West Coast Capital and Aldersgate Investments, Travelodge
            said in an e-mail today. The deal is valued at about 500 million
            pounds ($830 million), the London-based Times reported today
            without saying where it got the information. A spokeswoman for
            closely held Travelodge wouldn't comment on the price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Travelodge is adding properties and renovating its
            buildings in an effort to improve profitability. A group of
            creditors comprising Goldman Sachs, Avenue Capital and
            GoldenTree took ownership of the company in 2012 from Dubai
            International Capital in a debt-for-equity swap. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are well on our way to building a new Travelodge,'
            Chief Executive Officer Peter Gowers said in the e-mail. 'In
            the past 18 months we have invested 57 million pounds in
            modernizing our hotels, helping us attract more business
            customers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The budget-hotel chain, based in Thame, England, operates
            500 hotels and 38,000 rooms in the U.K., Ireland and Spain,
            according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Boost Salaries for Junior Staff About 20%</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which cut the portion of revenue set aside for pay the past two
            years, will increase 2015 salaries for junior employees in the U.S. by about 20 percent, according to a
            person briefed on the decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The raises will apply to employees in all divisions with
            the title of analyst, typically recent college graduates, said the person, who asked not to be identified
            speaking on personnel matters. The increase won't affect bonuses, which are based on the firm's and
            employees' performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms have been cutting
            hours and attempting to improve working conditions for junior bankers as the companies seek to prevent
            defections to competitors such as private-equity funds. Investment banks including Credit Suisse Group AG
            and Bank of America Corp. have encouraged analysts to take time off on weekends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is raising salaries for associates and vice presidents in its investment-banking and
            underwriting units worldwide by about 25 percent, a person briefed on the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's salary increase will bring some first-year analysts' annual base pay to about
            $85,000, the person said. Such employees typically are paid $70,000 to $90,000 in salary, with bonuses
            bringing total compensation to as much as $140,000, according to New York-based consultant Johnson
            Associates Inc. The junior-banker title doesn't refer to research analysts who recommend stocks to
            investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Weekend Work &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrew Williams, a Goldman Sachs
            spokesman, declined to comment. The New York Post reported on the pay increases earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Goldman Sachs decided to stop offering two-year contracts to investment-banking analysts,
            instead making them full-time employees from the start. Last year, it discouraged them from working weekends
            and pledged to hire more junior workers to prevent overloading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set aside
            37 percent of revenue for pay last year, down from 38 percent in 2012 and 42 percent in 2011. The ratio was
            43 percent in the first half of 2014, the same as a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Friends Life Said to Hire Goldman Sachs for Sale of Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Friends Life Group Ltd. (FLG), the U.K. insurer created by Clive Cowdery, has hired Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) to explore a sale of its international business, according to two people with knowledge of
            the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Provident International, which has offices in Hong Kong, Dubai and
            Singapore, could fetch about $750 million in a sale, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
            the information hasn't been made public. No final decision has been made, they said. Representatives for
            Friends Life and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Life is among U.K. insurers
            exploring asset sales. Chief Executive Officer Andy Briggs earlier this year sold the European
            wealth-management unit for as much as 356 million pounds ($590 million) to Blackstone LP and is doing a
            review of Sesame Bankhall Group Ltd., a financial-advisory company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Provident,
            with almost 7 billion pounds in assets under management, reported a 44 percent slump in the value of new
            business, a measure of future sales, in the first half of the year, citing 'challenging market conditions.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friends Life said in May that it would miss its earnings target this year after
            Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in his budget scrapped rules that pushed retirees to buy
            annuities with their pension savings. The shares have tumbled about 13 percent this year, erasing about 662
            million pounds in market value, which is 4.4 billion pounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RSA Insurance Group Plc
            (RSA) said yesterday that it agreed to sell its businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong after raising more
            than 600 million pounds from disposals in eastern Europe, Canada and China. Direct Line Insurance Group Plc
            is also in talks to sell its German and Italian operations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares rose as much as
            0.7 percent after the report, erasing earlier losses. They closed at 307.60 pence in London, up 0.2 percent
            on the day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Partners' Ownership at Lowest Since 2010</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners
            cut their ownership of the firm to the lowest level since 2010
            by exercising options dating from the financial crisis, as the
            total reaped this year from such awards nears $400 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The partners owned 8.52 percent of the New York-based
            company's shares on Aug. 13, down from 9.45 percent in May,
            according to a regulatory filing today. Individuals exercised
            options from July 16 to Aug. 12 that yielded $107 million after
            covering the cost of the options and some tax withholding, the
            filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The conversions bring the total netted by partners this
            year from the 2008 options to about $390 million, as the
            employees benefited from a doubling in the firm's stock price
            since the financial crisis. The options vested over three years
            ended in January 2012, and shares gained through such awards
            couldn't be sold until this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In December 2008, Goldman Sachs granted 36 million options
            in an effort to give top performers an incentive to stay after
            the bank reduced compensation expense by almost half during the
            credit crunch. More than 34 million of those options were still
            outstanding at the end of 2013. The partners have exercised
            almost 9 million of the options this year, according to filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The awards were granted at an exercise price of $78.78. The
            shares closed this week at $175.47 in New York, after climbing
            more than 38 percent each of the past two years. The partners
            also sold $77.4 million of shares unrelated to the options,
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund managers, it turns out,
            are really like a bunch of grown-up mall rats. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's the conclusion one could draw from Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc.'s report on trends in the alternative-investment
            industry. Managers continue to allocate about 20 percent of
            assets to shares in companies dependent on discretionary
            consumer spending. In the Standard Poor's 500 Index, their
            weighting is only 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That group of 85 stocks, from Walt Disney Co. to Nike Inc.
            and Yum! Brands Inc., was up 2.4 percent this year compared with
            an almost 8 percent gain in the SP 500 as of yesterday. As a
            result, many hedge-fund managers, like teenagers who spent too
            much time in the mall, are bringing home some lousy report
            cards. The industry has returned 1 percent so far this year,
            according to Goldman's Aug. 20 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Consistent large allocations to retail and media stocks
            in the consumer discretionary sector have been headwinds to
            returns,' Goldman strategists including Ben Snider and David Kostin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The smaller dispersion of returns within the group isn't
            helping matters, Goldman notes. There was a 94 percentage point
            gap between the SP 500's best performing consumer-discretionary
            stock this year (Under Armour Inc.) and the worst (Coach Inc.)
            as of today's open. That sounds like a lot, but not really when
            you compare it with the 217 percentage points that separated the
            top winner from the loser at this time of year in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;First, Worst &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still the current dispersion, second only to energy shares
            among the 10 main SP 500 groups, makes it easy to see why this
            is a tough group to quit. And, obviously, not everyone's a bull,
            especially after government data showed consumer spending
            stalled in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another report from research firm Markit this week showed
            demand to borrow shares of retailers in the SP 500 has climbed
            to a one-year high. As the back-to-school season kicks into full
            gear, Abercrombie Fitch Co., Kohl's Corp. and Five Below Inc.
            are among retail stocks showing increases in short interest,
            according to Markit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman serves as sort of a Jane Goodall to hedge-fund
            managers, journeying deep into the Excel jungles to learn more
            about these exotic creatures and report back to us on their
            mysterious ways. The additions and deletions to their indexes of
            most-important longs and shorts shows where the action has been
            in the consumer space. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Longs, Shorts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar General Corp. and DirecTV were added to their basket
            of very-important longs, while News Corp. and Constellation
            Brands Inc. were dropped. In the very important short basket,
            Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were added, while
            DirecTV, Kohl's and McDonald's Corp. were dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perusing the full list, it's clear that hedge-fund managers
            are scattered out across the entire mall, rather than clustered
            at a few stores. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anyway, one theory for their 20 percent weighting in
            consumer discretionary could be that hedge fund managers are
            wisely getting in front of a pickup in spending and subsequent
            rally in the shares. Another theory could be that one is not in
            the best position to gauge retail traffic trends if they're able
            to take a helicopter to the mall. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>DSW Surges After Profit Beats Estimates, Goldman Says Buy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;DSW Inc. (DSW) shares had the biggest
            rally in two years after the discount-shoe chain reported
            better-than-estimated earnings and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            recommended the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock gained 9.2 percent to $30.99 at 4 p.m. in New
            York, for the largest advance since May 2012. All of the
            company's major categories reported higher sales in the second
            quarter, compared with the first, according to a statement from
            the Columbus, Ohio-based company today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DSW reported earnings of 37 cents a share in the three
            months ended Aug. 2 excluding some items, exceeding the 32-cent
            estimate from a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts. Net income fell
            25 percent to $33.6 million, DSW said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A combination of increased focus, new leadership within
            women's and a strong balance sheet give DSW the tools to improve
            fundamentals in the coming quarters,' Taposh Bari, an analyst
            at Goldman Sachs, wrote today in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DSW has struggled this year with steadily declining profit
            and the shares are still down almost 30 percent in 2014. In May,
            it blamed an unusually cold winter and steep discounts for weak
            results in the first quarter and cut its profit forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DSW said today that annual earnings will be between $1.50
            and $1.65 per share. That compares with an average forecast of
            $1.53 a share from analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Partners Bott, Shalett Depart Ahead of New Class</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s list of
            so-called partners dropped to 409, the lowest in almost two
            years as the firm is set to name a new class at the end of this
            year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alison Bott, 58, who ran human capital management in Asia,
            and Lisa Shalett, 48, who led the firm's brand marketing and
            digital strategy, were absent from a list of partners included
            in an Aug. 22 filing. The pair retired earlier this year and
            will become advisory directors, according to a person briefed on
            the matter, who asked not to be identified speaking on personnel
            matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cyril Cottu, who worked in currency sales, also dropped
            from the list. Cottu remains with the firm, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Partner is the firm's highest rank, a nod to its history as
            a private partnership before going public in 1999. Such
            employees typically receive a $900,000 salary and share in a
            special bonus pool. The bank's partnership committee, led by
            Vice Chairman Michael Sherwood, selects an additional class
            every other year, including 70 new members in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of partners will fall further before the new
            class is added. Executives including Canada head Jack Curtin,
            63, and John Shaffer, who ran credit sales in New York, have
            announced their intentions to leave at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shalett worked at Goldman Sachs since 1995, including roles
            in equity sales and as chief operating officer of compliance,
            legal and internal audit, according to her LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cottu didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
            comment, while Shalett didn't answer phone calls to her listed
            number. Attempts to locate a phone number or e-mail address for
            Bott were unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Joins Nomura in Saying Silva Becoming Favorite</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Marina Silva's performance in the
            campaign's first televised presidential debate helped establish
            trust among voters and investors, reinforcing her status as the
            front-runner in Brazil's election, analysts from Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. to Nomura Holdings Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former environment minister showed in the debate aired
            last night on Bandeirantes TV that she would be 'reliable and
            not extreme' in the changes she proposes, Tony Volpon, head of
            emerging markets research for the Americas at Nomura, said by
            phone from New York. 'It makes her the odds-on favorite to win
            the election.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva, who captured the support of Brazilians dissatisfied
            with the political establishment and deteriorating growth when
            she entered the race, now is capturing enough backing from her
            competitors to beat President Dilma Rousseff in a runoff, two
            polls published this week show. Equities rallied on speculation
            Silva would do a better job managing the economy than Rousseff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva has 43.7 percent support in a possible Oct. 26 second
            round vote versus 37.8 percent for the incumbent, according to
            an Aug. 21-24 MDA survey published today, which has a margin of
            error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She has 45 percent of voters' support, against 36 percent
            for Rousseff, according to an Aug. 23-25 Ibope poll published
            yesterday. While both polls show Rousseff leading in the first
            round, she doesn't have the support needed to avert a runoff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stocks Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ibovespa stock exchange index rose 1.9 percent at 5:50
            p.m. local time today and the real appreciated 0.6 percent to
            2.2477 per U.S. dollar, the biggest increase among emerging
            market currencies after the South African rand and Turkish lira. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva criticized Rousseff's handling of the economy last
            night, saying the incumbent has failed on pledges to slow
            inflation and is poised to turn over the country in worse shape
            than she found it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She handled the debate well,' Alberto Ramos, chief Latin
            America economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a phone interview
            when asked about Silva. 'Based on the polls, it's her election
            to lose.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before the debate, Eurasia Group wrote in a note that the
            challenge for Silva will be to transition from being a protest
            vote candidate to someone voters are willing and able to trust
            to govern. The political risk consulting firm wrote today the
            candidate last night took a 'positive step' toward
            establishing her reputation as a credible leader. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Confident, Prepared &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva was confident and prepared in going after Rousseff on
            slowing growth while fielding questions on how she would forge a
            majority in Congress, said Andre Cesar, director at public
            policy and business strategy consulting company Prospectiva. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva said she could tap support from rival parties to form
            a majority. She said she would select for her government some of
            the country's best politicians who have been forced onto the
            sidelines by the ruling Workers' Party and candidate Aecio Neves's Brazilian Social Democracy Party. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She passed the first test,' Cesar said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Silva's campaign team has pledged to slow inflation to 3
            percent from 6.5 percent last month by the end of 2018, support
            formal autonomy for the central bank and undo fiscal policies
            that led to a sovereign debt rating downgrade this year. On the
            social front, she says she would expand the government program
            that transfers money to poor families, known as Bolsa Familia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Faster Inflation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Rousseff said that her policies have shielded the poor
            and workers from the effects of an international economic
            crisis, Silva retorted that faster inflation has undermined
            confidence and purchasing power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Silva would support inflation control, the floating
            exchange rate and cut government spending,' Luciano Rostagno,
            chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brazil in Sao Paulo, said in
            a phone interview. 'That is positive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the debate, Neves showcased his experience as the former
            governor of Brazil's second-most populous state, saying in a
            reference to Silva that voters shouldn't choose a president
            whose proposals are unclear. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Brazil also can't put up with new adventures, with
            improvisation,' said Neves, who is running third in polls. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She responded that voters were tired of the dominance of
            her two rivals' parties, which have ruled Brazil for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will respect the gains that were made in other
            governments,' she said. 'But we will correct the mistakes.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman New Madrid Landlord as Investors Return to Spain</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Marcelino Calvo Sanchez and his wife, Maria Luisa, had never heard of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            until last year, when the global investment bank bought the four-building housing estate where they live in
            Vallecas, on the southern outskirts of Madrid. Marcelino, a 71-year-old retired truck driver, isn't
            impressed by his new landlord. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs picked up the 289-unit complex in August
            2013 as part of its purchase of 3,000 low-income apartments from the regional government of Madrid for 201
            million euros ($269 million). With the sale, some subsidies for tenants disappeared, and, according to
            Sanchez, a small problem with squatters has become a larger one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't want to live
            with squatters,' Sanchez says. 'This has become a business -- it's not a social program anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's exactly right, Bloomberg Markets will report in its October issue. Though the housing estate
            looks like one of the last places in the world smart-money Goldman Sachs bankers would bet on -- glass doors
            are shattered, broken mailboxes hang open, and graffiti mars the courtyard walls -- this is where Goldman
            has touched down in the Spanish real estate market. Blackstone Group LP, the world's largest
            alternative-asset manager, bought a similar low-income-housing portfolio from the city of Madrid in July
            2013 for 125 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Speed Traders Seize NYSE Floor as IMC Takes Goldman Post</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When Scott Knudsen rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange this week, he signaled the
            ceremonial start of the day's session and the conquest of the NYSE floor by high-frequency trading firms.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His firm, IMC Chicago LLC, just finished its takeover of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s NYSE
            unit, giving it rights to manage buying and selling of dozens of stocks including prominent ones like
            International Business Machines Corp., Verizon Communications Inc. and Visa Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC
            joins rival automated trading firms Virtu Financial Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc. facilitating transactions at
            the NYSE in lower Manhattan, a role once filled solely by humans. While these high-frequency traders, so
            named because of the speed with which their computers trade, are often reviled by the people they've
            displaced, they're becoming more dominant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This illustrates how market makers from the
            traditional liquidity suppliers of banks and broker-dealers have been unable to compete in the
            decentralized, fully electronically traded market,' Terrence Hendershott, a professor at the University of
            California at Berkeley's business school, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trading on Speed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            ascent of automated market makers on the NYSE floor represents the latest leg of an evolution that began
            about a decade ago, when investment banks such as Goldman Sachs began to supplant smaller specialist firms.
            As advances in technology and rule changes narrowed profits and transformed stock trading into a volume
            business, computers took over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Best Suited' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Given IMC's
            specialized focus on market making and already extensive exchange-based trading operations, we believe IMC
            is best suited to drive' the NYSE floor operation, Todd Hohman, managing director and global head of the
            quantitative trading business at Goldman Sachs, said in a May 22 statement. IMC hired the investment bank's
            team of 15 floor traders, two technologists and an issuer relations manager. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs was seeking as much as $30 million for the business, a person familiar with the discussions said in
            April. The investment bank, which joined the NYSE in 1896, bought the operations in 2000 as part of a $5.4
            billion purchase of Spear Leeds Kellogg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Goldman Sachs's exit, the only bank at the
            NYSE floor is Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knudsen, managing director and head of trading at IMC in
            Chicago, said the firm's move to the NYSE floor was a natural extension of its business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Can't
            Ignore' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are and have been in the process over the past couple of years of building
            up our equity market-making business, so NYSE is an exchange we can't ignore,' Knudsen said in a phone
            interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IMC was founded in Amsterdam in 1989, and operates both a trading unit and an
            asset-management division. The firm conducts transactions on 100 markets around the world, according to its
            website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a time when high-speed traders face unprecedented regulatory and legal
            scrutiny, IMC, KCG Holdings and Virtu are now three of the largest traders at the NYSE, whose listed
            companies are worth more than any other exchange's. They thrived amid years of modernization and efforts to
            break the grip of NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market on trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average size of
            trades on NYSE Group's exchanges in the first seven months of the year was about 240 shares, compared with
            1,187 in 2000. In 1988, the average was 2,303 shares per trade. Along with that reduction, minimum trading
            increments have fallen from an eighth of a dollar to one cent. In other words, market making isn't as
            lucrative as it once was. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Building Scale' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's all about
            building scale to deal with the narrow spreads,' Chris Concannon, president of Virtu, which has eight
            traders on the NYSE floor, said in an interview. 'If you're a small company with excellent technology, it
            becomes profitable over time.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Designated market makers like IMC are required to offer
            trades at the national best price at least 15 percent of the time in the stocks for which they're
            registered, and are compensated with better trading fees by the exchange. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            electronic trading firms have taken over at the NYSE, their role at the Big Board also sees them employ
            human traders who man the posts at 11 Wall Street, the only stock trading floor in the U.S. Knudsen said
            it's a model that's liked by the corporations listed on the exchange. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We do recognize
            in talking to some of these issuers the real advantages in having people on the floor to help out with the
            IPO process and during any sort of market disruptions that come about, and that's just something we wanted
            to be a part of,' Knudsen said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intercontinental Exchange Inc., based in Atlanta,
            pledged to preserve the trading floor when it agreed to buy the exchange in 2012. ICE Chief Executive
            Officer Jeff Sprecher completed the takeover of NYSE in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We did have a
            conversation with Jeff before we committed to this acquisition, making sure that he was committed to the
            NYSE as well,' Knudsen said. 'We gained a lot of confidence from him that they are committed to this model.
            It is a big distinguishing factor, if you compare it to the different equity markets.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Euro Parity Call Shows Growth Crisis Draghi Confronts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s forecast
            for the euro to weaken to parity with the dollar comes as the
            region confronts escalating deflation and the risk that some of
            its biggest member states are falling back to recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robin Brooks, the New York-based chief currency strategist,
            cut his six-month forecast today to $1.25 from $1.34, saying the
            European Central Bank will need to ease monetary policy further
            to counter falling inflation expectations. The 18-nation
            currency will weaken to parity by the end of 2017, he said.
            Goldman isn't alone in cutting its outlook -- JPMorgan Chase
            Co. also reduced its forecast today to $1.26 from $1.28 by the
            end of June 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The ECB will ease more, I don't know what easing that
            will be, but that the direction of policy is pretty clear,'
            Brooks said in a telephone interview. 'People had doubts
            whether the ECB is going to take low inflation seriously, those
            expectations are being updated.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro had staged a 16 percent rally after ECB President
            Mario Draghi said he'll do 'whatever it takes' to save the
            currency in July 2012. Since reaching the high for the year on
            May 8, the euro has slumped 4.9 percent in the face of the
            weakest inflation in almost five years, a recession in Italy and
            zero growth in France. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut the three-month estimate to $1.29 from $1.35
            and the one-year forecast to $1.20 from $1.30. That's one of the
            most bearish views among banks surveyed by Bloomberg, with the
            median forecast of $1.31 by the end of the year and $1.30 by the
            end of the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inflation Gauge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro has slumped for seven consecutive weeks, the
            longest stretch in more than a decade. The shared currency was
            little changed at $1.3184 at 10:46 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Draghi last week pushed the central bank closer to
            quantitative easing by singling out the five-year, five-year
            inflation break-even rate, his preferred gauge of inflation
            expectations, sliding below 2 percent. Draghi previously said
            that a worsening of the medium-term inflation outlook would
            provide a reason for broad-based asset purchases. ECB officials
            meet Sept. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In contrast, the U.S. is moving closer toward raising
            interest rates. The Federal Reserve has kept the benchmark rate
            at a record-low zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, while
            futures traders saw about a 56 percent chance the central bank
            will start raising rates by July 2015, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The July Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed
            policy makers discussed the possibility that jobs gains may lead
            them to increase rates sooner than anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The longer-term forecast to parity is a pure view that
            growth in the U.S. will outperform that that of the euro-zone,'
            Brooks said. 'In terms of our euro forecast, we're clearly
            signaling growth will be better in the U.S.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Spain's bad bank will sell 437
            million euros ($592 million) of loans to Realia Business SA (RLIA) at a
            46 percent discount to their face value to Fortress Investment

            &lt;p&gt;At least nine funds expressed an interest in buying the
            debt from Sareb, as the Spanish bank is known, one of the people
            said. They both asked not to be identified because the
            information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spain set up Sareb last year to absorb 50.8 billion euros
            in real estate assets from lenders including the Bankia group
            that took state aid. Sareb has raised 1.7 billion euros this
            year, beating its target of 1.5 billion euros, Deputy Economy
            Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at a conference in Madrid
            last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Madrid-based Sareb declined to comment. A
            spokesman for Fortress, based in New York, also wouldn't

        <headline>Travelers Too Expensive to Be Defensive, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Travelers Cos. (TRV), the only property
            insurer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is too expensive to
            be a defensive pick for investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
            while outlining a 'cautious' outlook for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer's rating was downgraded to neutral from buy,
            Goldman Sachs analysts led by Michael Nannizzi wrote in a note
            to clients today. New York-based Travelers has rallied about 80
            percent since September 2011, when it was added to the bank's
            list of stocks to buy in the Americas, compared with the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index's 50 percent gain, the analysts
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earnings at property-casualty insurers were helped this
            year as underwriting margins widened, claims costs from natural
            disasters fell and reserves proved redundant. Such benefits may
            be unsustainable, making the industry less attractive after some
            companies' stock valuations rose, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Leading commercial insurers are at all-time highs,' the
            analysts wrote. 'On a relative-value basis, the sector is
            simply less defensive than at past market highs when valuations
            for the group were depressed relative to other industries, which
            made it a natural defensive choice.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Travelers fell 1.9 percent to $89 at 4 p.m. in New York,
            the biggest decline since July. The insurer ended November
            trading 33 percent above book value, the highest in about six
            years relative to the measure of assets minus liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for Travelers, declined to
            comment on the note. Goldman Sachs also downgraded commercial
            insurer W.R. Berkley Corp. to sell from neutral, citing
            valuation. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Predicts Biggest China H-Share Advance Since 2009</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong
            will post the biggest gain since 2009 next year on prospects the
            economy will stabilize, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), also known as the H-share index, will rally 18
            percent to 13,600 by the end of 2014,
            Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs,
            wrote in a report yesterday. The advance would be the biggest
            since the gauge surged 62 percent in 2009. The measure dropped
            0.8 percent to 11,450.55 at the midday break in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's manufacturing growth beat analyst estimates in
            November, indicating the nation's economic recovery is
            sustaining momentum amid government efforts to rein in credit
            growth. Goldman Sachs's H-share forecast forms part of a trade
            recommendation in which the bank is telling investors to buy
            Chinese stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities
            will lag the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade
            its fourth top recommendation for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Equities are our favorite asset class in an environment
            where growth is moderate but not overheating, while policy
            makers remain accommodative,' Weisberger said by phone
            yesterday. 'For the first time in the last several years, we
            would argue to own exposure to China through the Chinese equity
            market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China last month vowed to allow more private investment in
            state-controlled industries, loosen its one-child policy and
            better protect farmers' rights in the most sweeping reforms in
            two decades. The government also pledged to elevate the role of
            markets in the world's second-largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;H-Share Valuation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Economists estimate gross domestic product will expand 7.5
            percent next year after growing 7.6 percent this year, according
            to the median projection in Bloomberg News surveys last month.
            The government set a target for 7.5 percent expansion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the H-share index closed yesterday at the highest
            level since Feb. 20, it still traded 19 percent below its
            average valuation of the last five years, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg based on estimated earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've been positive for China for quite some time and
            it's an overweight country for us,' Allan Conway, who oversees
            $27 billion as head of emerging market equities at Schroder
            Investment Management in London, said in a phone interview
            yesterday. Chinese stocks account for about 22 percent of his
            portfolio. 'The market is attractively priced.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Copper Bet &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) slipped 0.1 percent to
            2,205.56 today. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in New York lost 0.1
            percent to 108.17
            yesterday while the iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest
            Chinese exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.9 percent to
            $39.79. The Standard Poor's 500 Index dropped 0.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Weisberger said buying the H-share and
            selling copper futures may generate a combined return of 25
            percent next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While stability in China's growth is enough to boost 'risk
            sentiment' after the H-share index fell 12 percent over the
            past three years, it's insufficient to lift demand for copper as
            a supply glut weighs on the market, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think the current context is a little bit different
            whereas whatever growth acceleration we are going to see in the
            coming year is going to be a developed market theme,' said
            Weisberger. 'When the economic growth is driven by the
            developed market, it's going to leave the commodity behind.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Treasury Yields &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weisberger ended a recommendation to buy China's H shares
            in November 2011 after the trade lost 5 percent. The Hang Seng
            China index rallied about 22 percent in the three months after
            he advised clients to exit the bet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The H-share wager is the fourth top trade recommended by
            Goldman for 2014. The other recommendations include buying SP
            500 futures while selling the Australian dollar; betting
            European interest rate swaps will decline while five-year
            Treasury yields will rise; and selling the Canadian dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In yesterday's trading in New York, SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN),
            the nation's biggest real estate website owner, gained the most
            among Chinese companies, surging 11 percent to $71.85. E-House
            China Holdings Ltd. (EJ), a real-estate service provider, rose 6.3
            percent to $11.35. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hollysys Automation Technologies Ltd., (HOLI) an automation system
            manufacturer, declined 5.7 percent to $17.90. The company said
            on Dec. 1 that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Changli Wang
            resigned. Jianfeng He, who was chief operating officer, was
            elected chairman, while Baiqing Shao, a senior vice president,
            will become CEO. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>KKR Said to Hire Goldman Sachs for Turkish Shipping Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co. (KKR), the private-equity firm
            run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, hired Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) to sell its Turkish shipping company U.N. Ro-Ro
            Isletmeleri AS, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York buyout firm, which bought the operator of
            roll-on roll-off transport vessels for about 910 million euros
            ($1.2 billion) in 2007, plans to sell its majority stake in the
            Istanbul-based company next year, the people said, asking not to
            be identified because the matter is confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR's assets include private equity, credit, hedge funds
            and other alternatives to stocks and bonds. The firm has been
            among the most active buyout firms in deploying capital this
            year and last month sold about 1.1 billion-euros worth of shares
            with Permira Advisers LLP in ProSiebenSat.1. Media AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR bought 97.6 percent of the Turkish company, which
            counts 12 vessels in its fleet and operates routes to Italy's
            Trieste, Toulon in France, and to Damietta in Egypt, in its
            first acquisition in Turkey and the biggest private equity
            investment in the country at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.N. Ro-Ro, originally set up by a group of Turkish
            transporters in 1994, increased sales to 221.8 million euros in
            2012, from 218 million euros in 2011, according to its website.
            Sales were 164.5 million euros when KKR bought it in 2007.
            Sailings rose to 627 in 2012 from 609 in the previous year and
            506 in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sued by Singapore Client Oei Over Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong over
            a $34.3 million loss on Brazilian real-yen options trades he claimed the bank misled him into making. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei accused the New York-based bank of fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty,
            fraudulent inducement and unjust enrichment in papers filed yesterday in New York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rejected allegations that it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter
            it wrote to Oei in July and filed in a Singapore court, where the businessman is suing a unit of the bank
            over the same loss. The bank has said it will defend that lawsuit, which it is seeking to halt in favor of
            private and confidential arbitration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A lot of clients are like me, they trust the big
            banks like they trust their doctors,' Oei, 65, said in an interview today. His friends have had similar
            experiences and he is suing for 'justice and fairness' for all clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea
            Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New York, said Oei's lawsuit is without merit and will be
            defended. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei said in the New York lawsuit that he cut dealings with Goldman Sachs in
            2011 after it profited on a losing trade it persuaded him to make. He said he resumed transactions after
            senior executives including President Gary Cohn and Asia head David Ryan visited him in April 2012 and said
            his interests would be placed first. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Suits Over Aluminum Set for Venue Hearing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The bankers are in New York, the
            exchange is in London and the aluminum is stored mostly around
            Detroit. The buyers of the metal suing over allegations of price
            manipulation are scattered across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The roughly 25 cases filed in varying combinations against
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), their
            warehousing businesses and the London Metal Exchange should be
            fought in New York, New Orleans or elsewhere, lawyers for the
            factions argued before a panel of federal judges today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The defendants are accused of constricting aluminum
            supplies to drive up prices in violation of U.S. antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The monopoly allegedly occurred in Detroit,' said
            Christopher Lovell, who filed the first of the lawsuits on Aug.
            1 on behalf of Gwinn, Michigan-based aluminum fabricator
            Superior Extrusion Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The restraint of trade 'emanated' from Detroit, where
            75 percent of the warehoused aluminum in the U.S. is stored,
            Lovell told six members of the federal Judicial Panel on
            Multidistrict Litigation in federal court in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Accusing Goldman and LME of tying up 1.5 million tons of
            aluminum and then charging above-market rates for its storage,
            Superior Extrusion is seeking class status on behalf of buyers
            who faced the same situation and unspecified money damages that
            would be tripled under federal antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Later Complaints &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Later complaints make similar allegations and demands. Most
            of the suits were filed in Detroit, four were brought in New
            York and others in Boston, New Orleans and Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The panel consolidates cases to streamline the pretrial
            exchange of evidence and taking of depositions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The primary means by which defendants accomplished their
            goal was to hoard, stockpile and manipulate the supply of
            physical aluminum stored in their warehouses in Detroit,'
            Lovell argued in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs and Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase,
            have each said the
            cases are without merit. Both banks are based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The center of gravity in the United States, if it's
            anywhere, is in New York,' attorney Margaret Zwisler argued
            before the panel today on behalf of JPMorgan Chase and the
            London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Aluminum Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The issue here is who made the rules and how were they
            made,' Zwisler said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs waived its right to argue before the panel,
            from which appellate Judge Marjorie Rendell was absent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Detroit is the world's second-biggest repository for
            aluminum stockpiles monitored by LME, the world's largest
            industrial metals marketplace. Goldman Sachs's Metro
            International Trade Services LLC has the most LME-approved
            warehouses in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Delays of as long as 16 months in filling aluminum orders
            raised prices for consumer-product makers, according to brewer
            MillerCoors LLC, which hasn't sued, and flashlight maker Mag
            Instrument Inc., which did. Mag, based in Ontario, California,
            named Goldman, Metro International and LME as defendants in a
            complaint filed in Los Angeles federal court in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Garrett Wotkyns, Mag's attorney, described a 'merry-go-round of metal,' as warehouse operators
            shifted inventory from
            one site to another to satisfy output requirements without
            actually relinquishing control of aluminum stockpiles. Other
            lawyers today made similar assertions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Not Simple &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asked by panel member U.S. District Judge Paul Barbadoro
            whether the defendants would dispute that such inventory
            movements occurred in Detroit, Zwisler replied, 'it's not that
            simple.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Whether their truck moved from one warehouse to another
            does not mean there's something wrong with that,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs' lawyer Samuel Rudman, arguing for case
            consolidation in New York, where he sued on behalf of Peterson
            Industries Inc., said truck drivers won't necessarily be
            witnesses in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LME told members last month it was changing its rules to
            accelerate withdrawals from depots where waiting times are
            exceeding 50 calendar days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the changes, slated to take effect April 1,
            warehouses with excessive delays will be required to ship at
            least 1,500 metric tons more metal each day than they take in. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Warehouse Review &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The exchange also said it would review its warehouse system
            every six months and is studying its powers to regulate
            warehousing companies' charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wotkyns, whose client makes the Maglite-brand flashlight,
            asked the panel to have the cases heard in Los Angeles, citing
            the experience of that court's judges and its capacity to handle
            the caseload. Phillip Howard, an attorney for Jacksonville,
            Florida-based pool deck-enclosure maker Master Screens Inc.,
            made similar arguments in support of its preferred venue,
            Tallahassee, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The panel heard about 45 minutes of argument today. It
            didn't immediately rule. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Aluminum Warehousing Antitrust
            Litigation, MDL No. 2481, Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
            Litigation (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MGIC Leads Mortgage Insurer Rally as Goldman Says Buy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and Radian
            Group Inc. (RDN) jumped in New York trading after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. recommended investors buy the shares, citing the potential
            for sales growth amid an improving housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MGIC advanced 2.4 percent to $8.29 at 4:03 p.m. after the
            stock was called a 'top idea' by Goldman Sachs. Radian gained
            1.1 percent. MGIC has tripled this year and Radian has more than
            doubled. Goldman Sachs set a $10 price target for MGIC and said
            Radian can reach $17 in the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers 'have one of the strongest secular
            growth stories among all financials,' Goldman Sachs analysts
            Eric Beardsley and Rachel Meyers said today in a report. 'Their
            pace of credit improvement is underestimated by the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Home prices in 20 cities rose 13.3 percent in the 12 months
            through September, the most since 2006, according to the
            SP/Case-Shiller index. That helped MGIC and Radian, which cover
            losses when homeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup
            costs. The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.6 percent annualized
            pace in the third quarter, the fastest in more than a year,
            Commerce Department figures today showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MGIC and Radian raised cash from investors this year to
            replenish capital drained when housing crashed. Essent Group
            Ltd. (ESNT), a mortgage insurer started after the financial crisis, has
            rallied about 30 percent since an initial public offering in
            October. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Obtains Veto Right Through Minority Stake in Dong Energy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is paying $1.5 billion for a minority stake in Dong Energy A/S,
            will get veto powers enabling it to block strategic decisions, according to a Danish Finance Ministry
            document. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman will be the only minority owner granted broad veto rights over the
            government-owned utility, according to the Dec. 3 dated document, which is due to be presented to members of
            the parliament's Finance Committee next week in Copenhagen. Dong will only be allowed to sell new shares or
            hybrid capital, change senior management or make acquisitions if it gets prior approval from Goldman,
            according to the document. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman and Danish pension funds ATP and PFA agreed on Oct. 2
            to become owners in Denmark's largest utility, which is shoring up its balance sheet after losing money on
            failed natural gas bets. The ministry is also asking the committee to approve a plan to list Dong before
            2021. Should the company seek an initial public offering before 2018, Goldman and ATP would need to approve
            the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry said the government will retain 56.1 percent to 60
            percent of Dong after the sale, valuing the company at at least 42.5 billion kroner ($7.75 billion). The
            current minority investors, which include local power companies, have the option to acquire new Dong shares
            for as much as 2.6 billion kroner to avoid diluting their stakes, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Usiminas Rallies on Goldman Sachs Steel Price Outlook: Rio Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
            SA and Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA rallied as Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. said the chance of steel price increases in the first
            quarter of 2014 has risen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Preferred shares of Usiminas gained 7.2 percent to 13.38
            reais at 2:43 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the highest level on a closing
            basis since March 2012. The steelmaker was the best performer on
            the Ibovespa, which added 1.7 percent. CSN, as Cia. Siderurgica
            is known, rose 4.8 percent to 12.62 reais, the steepest advance
            since Nov. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazilian steelmakers will probably raise prices at the
            beginning of next year as a decline in the currency reduced the
            domestic premium over overseas products, Marcelo Aguiar,
            Humberto Meireles and Diogo Miura, analysts at Goldman Sachs,
            wrote in a note to clients today. The real's decline should also
            discourage imports, helping to create a 'supportive scenario'
            for a domestic price increase, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais-based Usiminas gets about 80
            percent of its revenue from sales in Brazil, according to the
            company's third-quarter earnings statement. 'Usiminas has the
            higher operating leverage to domestic prices,' the Goldman
            Sachs analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The increase in prices will probably 'boost steelmakers'
            results in the first quarter of 2014,' according to the Goldman
            Sachs research note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real has weakened 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter,
            the worst performance among 16 major currencies tracked by
            Bloomberg, on concern Brazil's fiscal deterioration will lead to
            a reduced credit rating and speculation the Federal Reserve will
            curtail stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Kuroda $235,000 Salary Highlights Goldman Concern</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's payslip is 38 percent less than his predecessor's 15
            years ago, underscoring Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s warning that
            wages must rise for Abenomics to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank chief's pay is about 24 million yen
            ($235,000) for the year ending March 31, down from an inflation-adjusted 39 million yen in fiscal 1998,
            based on a BOJ statement
            on Nov. 29. Swaps signal an average inflation rate of 1.2
            percent over the coming five years, compared with 2.03 percent
            in the U.S. and 1.38 percent in the euro zone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's cost of living rose in October by the most in five
            years even as salaries extended declines from June 2012,
            threatening to derail Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to
            sustain a recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
            Goldman's chief Japan strategist Kathy Matsui on Dec. 4 called
            for higher wages, while Kuroda told regional business leaders
            this week that he expects an increase in basic pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Unless wages gain in Japan, higher prices will reduce
            purchasing power, hurting consumer spending and risking a
            slowdown in the economy,' said Akio Kato, the team leader of
            Japanese debt in Tokyo at Kokusai Asset Management Co., which
            manages the equivalent of $38 billion. 'It would be meaningful
            for the BOJ to take the initiative by hiking the governor's
            pay,' which is 'rather low,' Kato said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bernanke's Paycheck &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is set to receive
            $199,700 this year, while European Central Bank President Mario
            Draghi pulled in 374,124 euros ($511,200) last year. Bank of
            England Governor Mark Carney earns a basic salary of 480,000
            pounds ($784,000). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kuroda would need 25 years of his current salary to be able
            to afford a 10-year-old condominium with three bedrooms in
            central Tokyo that was priced at the equivalent of $5.8 million,
            according to a listing on Nomura Real Estate Holdings Inc.'s
            website. A similar-sized home in the city's eastern suburbs 30
            minutes by train from downtown sells for about $672,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 0.9 percent in
            October from a year earlier, government data showed. BOJ policy
            makers forecast the price growth, stripped of the effects of tax
            increases planned starting April, will quicken to 1.3 percent
            next fiscal year and to 1.9 percent in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Modest pay gains are expected considering the recovery in
            the labor market, but we can't anticipate a wage rise that's
            fast enough for the BOJ to achieve its 2 percent price goal,'
            said Toru Suehiro, a market economist in Tokyo at Mizuho
            Securities Co. 'Once it gets clear that the upward price path
            foreseen by the BOJ is unlikely to happen, it will provide a
            catalyst for nominal yields to decline.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's benchmark 10-year note yield rose four basis
            points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.67 percent today, after
            earlier touching 0.68 percent, the highest since Oct. 1. It
            reached a record low of 0.315 percent on April 5, the day after
            Kuroda and his board doubled monthly bond purchases to stoke 2
            percent inflation in two years. The yen has fallen 15 percent
            this year to 102.10 per dollar as of 3:33 p.m. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank cut the governor's salary last year by 30
            percent as a temporary measure to reduce costs while the nation
            rebuilt after the March 2011 earthquake. The decrease wasn't
            reversed this year with the pay kept at the same level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Salaries for the Bank of Japan's officers are determined
            in consideration of the remuneration and other circumstances of
            national public officers, as stipulated by the BOJ Act,'
            Yasutaka Hirata, a central bank spokesman, said without
            elaborating further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Tax Increase &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation's public debt has ballooned to more than 1
            quadrillion yen and is expected by the International Monetary
            Fund to grow to the equivalent of 244 percent of gross domestic
            product this year, the highest ratio globally. Abe approved
            raising Japan's consumption tax to 8 percent from 5 percent in
            April 2014 and will decide whether to increase it to 10 percent
            the following year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Considering Japan's finances, the sales tax may have to
            go higher even after being hiked to 10 percent,' said Maiko Noguchi, a former BOJ official and a Tokyo-based
            senior
            economist at Daiwa Securities Co., Japan's second-biggest
            brokerage. 'It will be a problem if the economy experiences a
            sharp fall every time the sales tax is raised and voters cry out
            in displeasure.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies have the cash to increase wages if they choose.
            Domestic non-financial private companies held 220 trillion yen
            in cash and bank deposits at the end of June, almost the size of
            Brazil's annual GDP, the latest data from the BOJ show. The
            amount reached 224 trillion yen in March, the most on record
            dating back to 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Intensifying Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There won't be many companies that increase base salaries
            unless they can expect sustained earnings growth,' said Daiwa's
            Noguchi. 'Modifying existing products doesn't create large
            demand. Instead, intensifying competition cuts companies' profit
            margins, and this can't be easily changed by Abenomics.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Japanese Trade Union Confederation, or Rengo, plans to
            demand pay increases of more than 1 percent during labor talks
            in spring, according to a statement released in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Household consumption accounted for 58 percent of Japan's
            real GDP last year, according to Cabinet Office data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government needs to fuel domestic consumption to
            boost GDP, and the only way is to raise wages,' said Satoshi Okagawa, a senior global-markets analyst in
            Singapore at
            Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., a unit of Japan's second-biggest
            financial group by market value. 'Policy makers want to convert
            companies' accumulated earnings into consumer spending, but
            businesses won't listen to their plea. That's why Kuroda is
            suffering.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman-Led Hunt for Corpbanca Suitor Spurs Rally: Andes Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bond investors are signaling they
            want Chilean billionaire Alvaro Saieh to sell his bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corpbanca's $800 million of notes due 2018 have returned
            1.9 percent since the Saieh-controlled bank said Nov. 29 that it
            was in preliminary talks with potential bidders. The gain is
            bigger than that of any other high-grade bond in emerging
            markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh, 64, is entertaining offers from Sao Paulo-based Itau
            Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) and Bilbao, Spain-based Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
            Argentaria SA (BBVA) as he looks for cash to plow into his retailer SMU
            SA after it violated debt agreements and restated earnings.
            Colombia-born Saieh, who has a doctorate in economics from the
            University of Chicago, has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
            Bank of America Corp. to sell a controlling stake in Corpbanca,
            two people familiar with the matter said Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Being taken in by a bigger, more diverse bank is
            positive,' Aaron Grehan, who helps manage $4.5 billion of
            emerging-market debt at Aviva Investors Ltd., said in telephone
            interview from London. 'It's a credit-improvement story. The
            headlines last week caused a change in sentiment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Corpbanca's
            benchmark notes instead of U.S. Treasuries fell to a five-month
            low of 3.13 percentage points yesterday after reaching a record
            high of 501 basis points on Aug. 29. The peso gained 0.2 percent
            to 528.7 per dollar at 7:35 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corpbanca declined to comment on its merger talks,
            according to an external press official who asked not to be
            named. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BBVA, Itau &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau, Latin America's biggest lender by market
            capitalization, is one of the banks Corpbanca has approached,
            said one of the two people, who asked not to be named because
            the negotiations are private. Corpbanca, based in Santiago, has
            a market value of $4.22 billion. Saieh and his family directly
            and indirectly own 76 percent of the bank, according to its most
            recent annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau declined to comment, according to an official who
            asked not to be named in keeping with company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Tobin, a spokesman for BBVA in Madrid, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corpbanca's BBB rating from Standard Poor's, the second-lowest investment grade, is in line with
            Itau's and one level
            above that of BBVA. Itau has subordinated bonds in dollars due
            in 2020 that yield 349 basis points more than U.S. Treasuries.
            BBVA's subordinated bonds in dollars due in 2022 yield 336 basis
            points more than Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculation that Itau or BBVA may buy Saieh's Corpbanca
            hasn't helped SMU's bonds. The yield on the bonds rose to 18.58
            percent yesterday from 18.4 on Nov. 29. It reached 21 percent on
            Oct. 30, up from 6.16 percent in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Severe Issues' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh has been selling off assets and has pumped $300
            million into SMU in an attempt to help bring the grocery chain
            into compliance with rules on its bonds that demand lower debt
            ratios. At the end of September, Corpbanca had made more than
            $400 million of loans and other credits tied to sister companies
            owned by Saieh, and the bank accounted for as much as 90 percent
            of his conglomerate's profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SMU 'has had severe issues with working capital and
            consuming all its cash,' said Soummo Mukherjee, an analyst at
            Moody's Investors Service who this week cut the company to Caa1,
            seven levels below investment grade. 'Any hiccup in liquidity
            would lead to an immediate downgrade.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Smart Guys' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh, a former head of research at the central bank,
            started his career in banking when he accepted an equity stake
            to join the management of Carlos Abumohor's Banco de Osorno y La
            Union. Saieh and Abumohor sold 51 percent of Banco Osorno to
            Spain's Banco Santander SA (SAN) in 1996 and used the profit to build
            Corpbanca. In the past 24 months, Saieh has spent $2.5 billion
            buying the Colombian operations of Banco Santander and Helm Bank
            to expand Corpbanca's regional presence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal told analysts
            on an earning conference call on Nov. 12 that Chile is a
            priority market and that the bank is considering acquisitions in
            Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Itau has said it wants to be a Latin American bank, but
            it's hard to grow organically so it needs to buy,' Anibal Valdes, an analyst at Barclays Plc in New York,
            said in a
            telephone interview. 'These are smart guys and they're not
            going to pay just any price but it would make sense to be the
            third-largest private bank in Chile. The banking business is all
            about scale.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even after the rally, Corpbanca's bonds still offer a
            premium to peers. The 4.17 percent yield on its notes compares
            with an average of 3.45 percent for investment-grade banks in
            Latin America, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It trades at a higher spread than the rest of the banks
            so the rationale behind the move makes sense,' Jaime Achondo,
            head trader at Finanzas y Negocios SA Corredores de Bolsa in
            Santiago, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rubicon Project Said to Select Morgan Stanley, Goldman for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Rubicon Project Inc., an online-advertising company that reaches more U.S. Web users than
            Google
            Inc. (GOOG)'s ad network, picked Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. to lead its initial public offering, according to people
            with knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rubicon, based in Los Angeles, is aiming for a market debut
            next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the information hasn't been disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While many newly public ad-technology companies have seen
            their share prices plunge, Rocket Fuel Inc.'s (FUEL) successful
            offering in September and the rally that followed Twitter Inc. (TWTR)'s
            IPO last month have instilled a renewed level of confidence.
            TubeMogul Inc., a maker of software for digital marketing, is
            also planning an IPO for next year, people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ben Billingsley, a spokesman for Rubicon, declined to
            comment. Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman at Morgan
            Stanley, declined to
            comment on their banks' roles in the Rubicon IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rubicon, whose technology automates the buying and selling
            of online promotions for marketers and publishers, topped $100
            million in revenue three years ago and is profitable. Its
            network reached 96 percent of U.S. Internet users in October,
            compared with 95 percent for Google, according to ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Founded in 2007 by Frank Addante, Rubicon has raised at
            least $60 million from investors including Clearstone Venture
            Partners and Mayfield Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Public Debut &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rocket Fuel, a provider of technology to manage, run and
            evaluate online-ad campaigns, has jumped 68 percent since its
            IPO in September. Ad-tech companies that went public earlier
            this year have dropped, including video-ad network YuMe Inc. (YUME),
            which has declined 11 percent since debuting in August, and
            rival Tremor Video Inc., which has plunged 57 percent since its
            June IPO. Marin Software Inc. has fallen 30 percent since its
            March IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Addante told Bloomberg News in August that he was holding
            off on an IPO until Rubicon's numbers could impress Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors in general appreciate companies that are at
            scale, profitable, have high growth rates and are technology
            companies,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tomkins Said to Work With Goldman Sachs on Sale or IPO Next Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tomkins Ltd., a London-based
            producer of auto parts and industrial products, is working with
            banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a sale or initial
            public offering, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Closely held Tomkins could fetch at least $6 billion, said
            two of the people, who asked not to be named because the process
            is private. Goldman Sachs will help Tomkins find a buyer
            starting in February, or lead the IPO if the company decides to
            go public, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tomkins is more likely to go with an IPO, one of the people
            said, because of its size and a relative dearth of competitors
            in its industry. Toronto-based private-equity firm Onex Corp.
            and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board bought Tomkins in
            2010 for $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. would have
            prominent underwriting roles on an initial share sale, according
            to the people familiar with the matter. Credit Suisse Group AG
            and Deutsche Bank AG would also be involved in underwriting an
            IPO, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for the banks declined to comment. A spokeswoman
            for CPP also declined to comment, while a spokeswoman for Onex
            didn't respond to a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gates, Aquatic &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tomkins owns Gates Corp., a provider of power transmissions
            and fluid-transfer products, and Aquatic, a producer of acrylic
            bathtubs and showers, according to the company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gates is the larger of the two companies with $2.9 billion
            in annual sales in 2012 and $551 million in earnings before
            interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the website
            shows. Aquatic had $114.5 million in sales and had negative
            Ebitda of $6.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reuters previously reported that Tomkins was interviewing
            advisers to help in a potential sale. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mixi Slumps After Goldman Sachs Cuts Rating to Sell: Tokyo Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mixi Inc. (2121), a Japanese game and
            social network operator, fell the daily limit in Tokyo trading
            after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its recommendation to sell
            from neutral and said the shares have risen too high. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock fell 17 percent to 7,560 yen as of the close of
            trade. Shares of the Tokyo-based company had risen 661 percent
            from Nov. 19 through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mixi had surged on expectations of profit from its new
            smartphone game 'Monster Strike' and the 'YYC' social app,
            according to the Goldman note. 'Monster Strike,' which allows
            up to four players to participate simultaneously, was ranked as
            the 29th most popular free game on iTunes today, according to
            the AppDB website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two apps would need to earn 26 billion yen ($253
            million) in combined annual revenue to justify the current share
            price, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hiroyuki Osawa, a spokesman for Mixi, declined to comment
            by phone. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) led
            gains in Chinese stocks traded in New York after Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. said the online real estate services provider is
            poised to extend its six-month rally as housing prices soar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg China-US Index of the most traded Chinese
            equities in the U.S. rose less than 0.1 percent to 104.55
            yesterday, after dropping the most in two years the previous
            day. About two stocks rose for every one that fell on the gauge.
            Shanghai-based E-House jumped 6.8 percent while hotel chain
            China Lodging Group Ltd. (HTHT) posted the biggest advance in a month.
            Baidu Inc., China's biggest search engine, capped the largest
            two-day decline since October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The value of homes sold in China increased 19 percent to
            the highest since December 2011, according to government data
            released this week. E-House, which has surged 50 percent this
            quarter to lead gains on the China-US gauge, stands to benefit
            from this trend as a property agent, Shanghai-based Goldman
            analysts led by Yi Wang wrote in a report dated Dec. 11. Goldman
            also raised its estimate for E-House's 2014 adjusted earnings by
            10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Rising home sales signal that the government won't take
            irrational steps to curb growth of China's property sector,'
            Tian X. Hou, the founder of T.H. Capital LLC, said by phone from
            Beijing yesterday. 'Investors didn't consider E-House as an
            Internet company until this year, after it expanded its e-commerce business. Both government policy and its
            own business
            restructuring have helped the stock's performance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETF Retreats &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese
            exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 1.1 percent to $38.11
            in New York, extending its decline to a fourth day. The Standard
            Poor's 500 Index retreated 0.4 percent as improving economic
            data spurred speculation that the Federal Reserve will cut
            stimulus as soon as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;E-House's American depositary receipts soared to $13.80,
            the highest level since February 2011. Trading volume was twice
            the three-month average compiled by Bloomberg. The ADRs have
            gained 237 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company sold $135 million of 2.75 percent five-year
            convertible notes yesterday. The conversion price of the notes
            was about $16.80 for each ADR, a 30 percent premium over the
            closing level Dec. 11, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman lifted its earnings projections for E-House by 11
            percent for 2015 and 12 percent for 2016 to reflect 'potential
            benefits from the sharper focus on online expansion and our
            estimated dilution impact from its convertible bonds issuance,'
            according to the note. It also increased a 12-month price target
            to $16.77 from $14.39. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;SMIC Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN), China's biggest real-estate
            information website, rallied 4.1 percent to $71.82, extending
            its gains this quarter to 39 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Lodging, a budget hotel operator based in Shanghai,
            surged 6 percent to $25.76. Phoenix New Media Ltd., a television
            and Internet news outlet, climbed 4.7 percent to $8.99, rising
            the most in four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (981), a
            Shanghai-based chip foundry, climbed 1.6 percent to $3.72 after
            retreating 10 percent in a six-day slump. BOC International
            Holdings Ltd. analysts led by Cheng Manjiang named the company a
            2014 top pick among shares listed in Hong Kong in a report
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baidu's ADRs slid 1 percent to $171.50 in New York,
            retreating 4.7 percent from a two-year high of $108.77 reached
            on Dec. 10. The ADRs have jumped 71 percent this year, the best
            advance since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mindray Medical International Ltd. (MR), a medical device maker
            based in Shenzhen, tumbled 11 percent to $35.61, the biggest
            decline since August 2010. Volume was four times the 90-day
            average. Short interest on its stock was 23 percent of shares
            outstanding as of Dec. 10, Markit data showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong
            retreated 1 percent to a four-week low of 10,962.18, while the
            Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) fell less than 0.1 percent to 2,202.80
            in a third day of slump. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Earns Most in Hilton IPO With More Than Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) isn't the
            lead underwriter on Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s initial
            public offering. The investment bank still stands to reap more
            than any other firm handling the largest-ever hotel IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will generate more than $117 million in
            proceeds from the $2.35 billion deal as a stakeholder and
            lender, based on a description of the bank's holding in the
            sale's prospectus and Hilton's statement on the final terms.
            That's on top of fees as an underwriter of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The windfall stems from the firm's six-year involvement
            with Hilton's buyout and return to the stock market. The bank
            was among lenders providing $20.6 billion of mortgage and
            mezzanine debt to finance Blackstone Group LP's 2007 purchase of
            the hotel chain. A 2010 debt restructuring gave Goldman Sachs a
            stake in Hilton, and the firm served as a lender in credit
            facilities that are being repaid with IPO proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, isn't alone in having
            multiple roles in the sale.
            New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) also had a stake in the Hilton
            holding company and was set to receive stock in the hotel
            operator or cash from the IPO, the prospectus shows. That
            investment is held by Morgan Stanley's asset management unit,
            according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be
            identified because details of the holding aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Coupons.com Said to Seek IPO, Picking Goldman Sachs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Coupons.com Inc., which took coupon
            clipping from newspapers to the Web in 1998, plans to go public
            next year and has picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lead the
            offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mountain View, California-based company, whose
            customers range from General Mills Inc. to Walgreen Co., makes
            money when a customer downloads a coupon for redemption. More
            consumers using digital coupons spurred RetailMeNot Inc. (SALE) to go
            public earlier this year and Ebates Shopping.com Inc. to seek an
            IPO in 2014, people familiar with the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Patrick
            Crisp, a spokesman for Coupons.com, declined to comment. The
            people familiar with Coupons.com's IPO plans asked not to be
            identified because the information isn't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Internet companies are jumping at the chance to go public
            after Twitter Inc. shares almost doubled following the
            microblogging site's IPO last month. In addition to Ebates,
            Internet-dating site Zoosk Inc. picked banks for its IPO, as did
            online-advertising companies TubeMogul Inc. and The Rubicon
            Project Inc., according to people with knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coupons.com is backed by investors including venture-capital firm Greylock Partners. A $200 million
            investment from
            institutional investors in 2011 valued the company at $1
            billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 100 million adults in the U.S. will use digital
            coupons next year, up from 96.6 million in 2013, according to
            researcher EMarketer Inc. RetailMeNot, an Austin, Texas-based
            provider of digital coupons, priced a secondary offering of its
            stock yesterday at $26 a share, a 24 percent increase over the
            company's IPO price in July. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Goes Against Consensus in Dollar Call</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Thomas Stolper, who correctly predicted the dollar's slide against the
            euro this year, is deviating from the consensus that the
            greenback will be among the best currencies to own in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dollar will weaken through 2014, reaching $1.40 per
            euro for the first time since October 2011, Goldman's London-based chief currency strategist said. The mean
            estimate in a
            Bloomberg survey of 46 contributors is for a 7 percent rally to
            $1.28 per euro from $1.3758 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Firms from BNP Paribas SA to Barclays Plc and Morgan
            Stanley say a strengthening U.S. economy will allow the Federal
            Reserve to pull back on stimulus measures that include printing
            dollars to buy $85 billion of bonds every month. For Stolper,
            that will be offset by the Fed keeping its benchmark interest
            rates at about zero even as it reduces bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Tapering is in the price already, we find it difficult to
            see where the dollar strength would come from,' Stolper wrote
            in an e-mailed response to questions this week. 'There is
            always a risk that stronger growth in the U.S. suddenly pushes
            rates even higher as markets anticipate a stronger Fed response.
            However, our base case is that we see only marginal support for
            the dollar from interest rates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stolper's Calls &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stolper, 45, predicted in December 2012 that the dollar
            would trade at about $1.33 per euro in June. It averaged $1.32
            that month, falling as low as $1.34. He cut his outlook on the
            dollar Sept. 12 when it was trading at about $1.33, predicting
            it would weaken to $1.38 per euro in three months, from a
            previous forecast of $1.34. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of 46 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, 42 expect the
            greenback to gain against Europe's common currency next year as
            rising Treasury yields lure international investors from lower
            returning counterparts. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes yield
            104 basis points, or 1.04 percentage points, more than
            comparable maturity German bunds, close to the biggest premium
            in about seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index has risen 1.8 percent from
            an eight-month low in October as gains in employment added to
            speculation the Fed may slow its quantitative-easing program as
            soon as next week's policy meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Euro &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The euro has strengthened 4.3 percent this year against the
            dollar, making it the best performer among 16 major currencies
            tracked by Bloomberg. It got an added boost after European
            Central Bank President Mario Draghi left interest rates
            unchanged and gave no indication he would take further steps to
            ease monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect all major central banks on hold until at least
            late 2015 -- hence, no immediate catalyst' for further gains in
            the dollar, Stolper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While strategists predict broad dollar gains, investors are
            hedging their bets ahead of the Dec. 17-18 Fed meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures traders reduced net wagers that the dollar will
            gain versus eight peers including the euro, yen and pound to
            $18.9 billion as of Dec. 3, from $19.1 billion a week earlier,
            according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data compiled
            by Societe Generale SA. The net long position on Nov. 26 was the
            most since Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following the end of the first two rounds of quantitative
            easing, the dollar showed little momentum. The Bloomberg U.S.
            Dollar Index rose 0.4 percent the month after what's known as
            QE1 was completed in March 2010, and fell 1.3 percent the month
            after QE2 in June 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inflation Change &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The dollar may stay here for a while as the Fed will get
            away with the story of inflation is nowhere to be seen,' Jose Wynne, the head of foreign-exchange research
            at Barclays in New
            York, said in a phone interview. 'But this may change in the
            second half of next year, when inflation starts to turn
            around.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays forecasts the dollar will rally to $1.27 against
            the common currency by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since reaching a three-year high of 3.9 percent in
            September 2011, inflation has slowed. In October, consumer
            prices rose 1 percent from a year earlier, the smallest increase
            in four years, according to a Nov. 20 Labor Department report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Better economic growth in the U.S. relative to most
            developed nations will support the dollar, according to Morgan
            Stanley. The world's biggest economy will grow 2.6 percent in
            2014, versus 1 percent in the euro area and 2.4 percent in the
            U.K., according to separate Bloomberg surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Key Drivers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In this environment, we believe that relative growth
            differentials will be key currency drivers, and these are
            dollar-supportive, given that the U.S. private sector has
            delevered more than the rest of developed markets,' Morgan
            Stanley strategists led by Hans Redeker in London wrote in a
            Dec. 2 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the same time, a persistent deficit in the current
            account, which is the broadest measure of trade because it
            includes investment, hurts demand for the dollar, according to
            Stolper. The shortfall was $98.9 billion in the second quarter.
            The euro area recorded a current-account surplus in September
            for the eighth consecutive month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A growth story convincing enough to see international
            investors commit more capital to the U.S.' is necessary for a
            breakthrough in the dollar, Stolper said. 'So far, we have seen
            mainly capital outflows from the U.S.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Charter Said to Tap Goldman Sachs for TWC Bid Financing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) added
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) to a group
            of banks prepared to lend it as much as $25 billion for its Time
            Warner Cable Inc. bid, people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group also includes Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Deutsche
            Bank AG and Barclays Plc (BARC), said one of the people, who asked not
            to be named because the discussions are private. While Charter
            hasn't signed a letter of commitment yet, the banks have agreed
            to fund a bid, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charter met with the lenders last week to set financing
            terms, one of the people said. The fourth-largest U.S. cable
            operator is planning to offer less than $135 per Time Warner
            Cable share, a person said last week. At that price, Time Warner
            Cable is valued at about $62 billion, including debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bid will include cash and Charter's stock, and Charter
            may also sell shares in a public offering, one of the people
            said. John Malone's Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA), currently Charter's
            largest shareholder, will contribute cash to maintain about a 27
            percent stake in the new company, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alex Dudley, a spokesman for Stamford, Connecticut-based
            Charter, and Susan Leepson, a spokeswoman for Time Warner
            Cable, declined to comment, as did representatives of Goldman
            Sachs and Credit Suisse. Courtnee Ulrich, a spokeswoman for
            Liberty, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            Sachs Group Inc., as president and chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forst, 53, will take over the positions from Carlo Barel di Sant'Albano, Cushman's chairman, on
            Jan. 6, the New York-based
            company said in a statement today. Di Sant'Albano was interim
            president and CEO for five months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forst's hiring 'will further strengthen Cushman
            Wakefield's ability to capture the opportunities to accelerate
            the firm's growth,' said John Elkann, chairman and CEO of Exor
            SpA, the brokerage's parent company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He will be Cushman's fourth CEO in four years. Di
            Sant'Albano took the job temporarily after Glenn Rufrano left in
            June. Rufrano, former CEO of Australian shopping-center landlord
            Centro Properties Group, joined O'Connor Capital Partners as its
            chairman and CEO last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forst was Goldman's global co-head of investment management
            when he left in 2011 after 17 years there, interrupted by a
            2008-2009 tenure as Harvard University's executive vice
            president. He is a 1982 Harvard graduate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After leaving Goldman, Forst was an adviser to investment
            firm Fenway Partners, Cushman said. In 2007, he served as
            chairman of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
            Association. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Executive Tourre Should Pay Fine, SEC Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the ex-Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) vice president found liable for his part in a failed
            $1 billion investment, should pay $1.1 million in fines,
            disgorgement and interest, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre, 34, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at
            which the SEC claimed he intentionally misled investors in a
            subprime mortgage vehicle called Abacus. The agency alleged
            Tourre lied about the role played by billionaire John Paulson's
            Paulson Co. hedge fund, which helped choose the portfolio of
            securities underlying Abacus then made a billion-dollar bet it
            would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These remedies are appropriate because the conduct that
            the SEC proved at trial was egregious,' the SEC said in a brief
            filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. 'Tourre, a
            licensed securities professional, took the lead in structuring a
            financial product that was secretly designed to maximize its
            potential for failure.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC asked U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest to
            impose a fine of $910,000 and order that he disgorge $175,463 of
            his 2007 bonus plus $62,858 in interest. The agency is also
            seeking an order barring Tourre from violating the securities
            laws in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chris Kittredge, a spokesman for Tourre with the firm Sard
            Verbinnen Co., declined to comment on the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Bond Investors to Flexible Mutual Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is drawing record deposits into a bond mutual fund that's making
            money even as interest rates rise, giving the bank a boost in one of the few Wall Street businesses it
            hasn't dominated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX) attracted $9.8 billion
            in the first 11 months of 2013, more than three times the net new cash taken in by the New York-based
            company's previous best-selling mutual fund in a calendar year, according to Morningstar Inc. (MORN) data
            going back to 1993. The $12.5 billion fund returned 5.3 percent in 2013 through Dec. 13, beating 96 percent
            of rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund has quintupled in size this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strategic Income is raising the bank's profile in the $14.6 trillion U.S. mutual-fund industry by
            standing out among a breed of bond products whose managers can invest across the fixed-income spectrum,
            including bets that pay off when interest rates rise. The unconstrained funds have caught on as investors
            flee conventional fixed-income funds in anticipation of rates climbing further and spurring losses in bonds
            when the Federal Reserve scales back its asset-buying program. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This portfolio has a
            shot at making money in any rate environment,' co-manager Michael Swell said in a telephone interview from
            New York. 'You will see money flowing out of traditional fixed income into products like this one.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Schwartz Owns Stock, Options Worth $75 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Harvey M. Schwartz, who became
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s chief financial officer yesterday,
            owns stock and options in the bank worth about $75 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz owns 175,493 shares of Goldman Sachs, along with
            171,419 restricted stock units that have been awarded over the
            past three years, according to his initial ownership filing as
            CFO today. He also has 302,888 options that expire in 2018, the
            filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At today's closing price of $149.90, the shares and
            restricted stock units, which are fully vested, are worth $52
            million. The options, which have strike price of $78.78, are
            worth about $22.8 million, according to Bloomberg calculations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 48, was one of three global co-heads of the sales
            and trading division before the New York-based firm announced in
            September that he would succeed David A. Viniar as CFO at the
            end of January. Viniar, whose 12 years in the role made him the
            longest-serving CFO on Wall Street, is joining the bank's board
            of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz also owns 30,000 shares, with a value $4.5
            million, in a trust that benefits a family member, according to
            the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's LEG IPO Flat as Property Value Gains Questioned</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG, which completed
            the largest initial public offering for a German property
            company yesterday, unchanged on its first day of trading as
            analysts questioned whether its homes will grow in value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Considering their portfolio, the pricing was very
            ambitious,' said Georg Kanders, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe
            KG. Many of LEG's apartments are in small cities whose
            population is shrinking, he said. Some are in regions with
            struggling economies. 'The quality of the properties' locations
            doesn't justify the price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien, which became Germany's largest publicly
            traded property company by market value through the IPO, closed
            at 44 euros in Frankfurt, giving the company a market value of
            2.3 billion euros. Before the IPO, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            owned 95 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;German property stocks have been in demand as investors
            seeking a safe haven amid the European sovereign debt crisis.
            Stocks of companies that own homes in booming cities such as
            Berlin trade more expensively than those with properties in
            smaller cities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're comfortable with our share price development
            today,' LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in an
            interview. 'Our IPO was clearly oversubscribed. We're a long-
            term product.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Wohnen, Germany's second-largest listed property
            company has about 50% of its apartments in the German capital
            and trades at 19 percent above its net asset value, according to
            data compiled by Warburg Research GmbH. NAV measures the value
            of a property company's buildings excluding debt. By contrast,
            TAG Immobilien AG (TEG), whose holdings are more widely scattered
            among smaller cities, trades at a 5 percent discount, according
            to Warburg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The share is expensive compared to its peers,' said
            Torsten Klingner, an analyst at Warburg Research. LEG's IPO was
            priced at 16 percent above its net asset value, which is higher
            than the average of other German residential companies, he said.
            'I don't see any upside.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;LEG Regions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
            Germany's most populous state. The state's gross domestic
            product is the country's highest, according to data compiled by
            the state government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some cities, especially former mining centers such as
            Dortmund and Essen, have falling populations and declining
            economies, said Ralph Henger, an economist at the IW Koeln
            economic institute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG has about 70% of its apartments in cities with
            shrinking populations, according to data compiled by Warburg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'North Rhine-Westphalia has the highest population density
            in Germany, and it's a place where people rent their homes,'
            Hegel said. 'We have properties in extraordinary locations and
            they're widely spread.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Names Powell to Lead Urban Investment Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, named Dina H. Powell, who
            leads the
            firm's charitable efforts, to also head its urban investment
            group that makes socially minded deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell will retain her role as head of the office of
            corporate engagement and join the management team of the bank
            subsidiary, according to an internal memo sent by Goldman Sachs
            Chief of Staff John Rogers and Esta Stecher, the head of Goldman
            Sachs Bank USA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell has helped Goldman Sachs develop its 10,000 Small
            Businesses initiative that provides training and loans to
            entrepreneurs. The urban investment group, or UIG, has created
            the Goldman Sachs Social Impact Fund, which provided financing
            to a program announced last week to cut recidivism among youth
            in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'UIG has evolved its mission to focus on impact investing,
            deploying more than $3 billion in loans and equity investments
            to revitalize neighborhoods and support underserved
            communities,' Rogers and Stecher wrote in the memo. 'More
            recently, UIG has led the way in developing creative market-based solutions to help address significant
            economic and public
            policy challenges.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2007 and was
            named a partner in 2010. She previously served as U.S. assistant
            secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs in
            George W. Bush's administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Powell's expanded duties were reported earlier today by the
            New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) and VTB
            Capital bought a 50 percent stake in Russian Fitness Group for
            an undisclosed amount to invest in the country's growing
            enthusiasm for working out. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, a minority investor since 2006, will
            'substantially' increase its holding with the deal, managing
            director Anton Schreider said in an an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is 'a further demonstration of Goldman
            Sachs's long-term commitment to investing in Russia as well as
            our flexible investment mandate allowing us to back strong local
            businesses over extended time horizons,' Schreider said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian Fitness Group, which runs the World Class and
            FizKult chains, has grown to 60 clubs in 22 cities in 21 years.
            The clubs have 109,000 members with 2,700 training and
            administrative staff, according to its website. Pop star Madonna
            came to Moscow in 2012 to open a branch of her Hard Candy
            fitness clubs near the Kremlin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Olga Sloutsker, president of World Class and a former
            Russian fencing champion, said the company plans to open nine
            more clubs this year in Russia and the Commonwealth of
            Independent States. Sloutsker, the chain's founder, will remain
            with the company, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, said in 2011 it has made
            more direct investments in closely held Russian businesses than
            any foreign bank, buying stakes in 15 companies totaling more
            than $1 billion since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of those was lender Tinkoff Credit Systems, which did
            an initial public offering in London last year. Goldman helped
            to organize the October IPO and raised $226 million from selling
            stock, cashing out almost two-thirds of its stake. &lt;/p&gt;

            Investment Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'My children hate that BlackBerry,' said Yeung,
            whose clients have been calling amid two weeks of declines that erased $3 trillion from global stocks. She's
            advising calm, noting that profits are rising and shares just got a lot less expensive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Being
            a contrarian and getting in when things seem bad is often a good thing,' she said in an interview today.
            'The companies we are looking into can still deliver attractive margins. Things are getting cheap.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strategists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to AMP Capital Investors and JPMorgan Chase Co. are also
            telling clients to hang on after losses that began with currencies in Turkey and Argentina spread to
            developed markets. The Standard Poor's 500 Index slid 2.3 percent yesterday, capping its first 5 percent
            retreat in eight months, while Japan's Topix index plunged 4.8 percent for its biggest decrease since June.

            e-mail. 'Since we do not see sufficient reason to change our fundamental earnings outlook and stock prices
            have fallen, the market still appears attractive to us.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Along with running Goldman Sachs's Political Action
            Committee, Malan lobbied on the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that
            overhauled U.S. financial regulation. He also worked on the
            bank's defense of subprime loan investigations by the Senate
            Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Securities and
            Exchange Commission. Goldman Sachs settled the SEC case in July
            2010 for $550 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At London-based Rio, one of Malan's first tasks will be
            helping the company in Washington as it seeks to protect an
            estimated $14 billion investment in a Mongolian copper mine that
            has come under fire from the government there. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jake Siewert, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said Malan
            'was an invaluable part of our D.C. team and will be a terrific
            asset for Rio.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman O'Neill to Retire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) economist
            Jim O'Neill, who bound Brazil to Russia, India and China to form
            the BRIC investing strategy, will retire this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill, 55, will step down from his current role as
            chairman of the asset-management division, which he has held
            since 2010, the New York-based firm said today in a statement.
            He joined the company in 1995 as a partner, became head of
            global economics, commodities and strategy research in 2001 and
            was added to the European management committee in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In each of his roles at the firm, Jim has served our
            clients by formulating views on global economic and market
            themes and helping them to be positioned for the most
            significant investment opportunities,' Chief Executive Officer
            Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn wrote in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill said in an e-mail he hadn't decided what he'll do
            when he leaves Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tim O'Neill and Eric Lane will continue to co-head the
            asset-management division, and there are no plans to replace
            O'Neill as chairman, Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs
            spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The position was created for him
            when he joined the unit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill developed the BRICs theory following the Sept. 11
            terrorist attacks, after becoming Goldman Sachs's sole chief
            economist, to reflect the waning influence of the U.S. on the
            world's economy. In the years afterward, it was central to
            Goldman Sachs's economic outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Manchester Fan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He is a frequent commentator for media outlets, appearing
            on Bloomberg Television and CNBC. An Englishman who is the son
            of a postman and graduated from Sheffield University, he has
            also worked for Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before joining Goldman Sachs, O'Neill was head of global
            research for Swiss Bank Corp., a firm he joined in 1988,
            according to his biography. That company bought S.G. Warburg
            Co., the advisory firm founded by Siegmund Warburg, in 1995,
            before joining with Union Bank of Switzerland to form UBS AG in
            a deal completed in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A lifelong fan of Manchester United, the most successful
            soccer club in the U.K., O'Neill once sat on its board and later
            was part of a group considering making a takeover bid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;O'Neill recently published a book entitled 'The Growth
            Map: Economic Opportunity in the BRICs and Beyond.' It updated
            and expanded his theory that the BRIC nations would join the
            U.S. and Japan as the world's biggest economies by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Extremely Overvalued' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So popular has the BRIC term become that its leaders now
            meet for annual summits alongside South Africa. O'Neill remained
            a defender of the theory even as the economies slowed and the
            membership of Russia was questioned by some because of
            governance concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his current role, O'Neill publishes a regular report to
            clients, combining views on the global economic outlook with
            details of his travels and commentary on Manchester United's
            performances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His most recent report, released Jan. 25, cited
            'considerable evidence' that economies are improving around
            the world and suggested the yen is 'extremely overvalued.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He told Bloomberg Television in October that he didn't
            apply to replace Mervyn King as the next governor of the Bank of
            England, saying he didn't think it was 'appropriate.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Blankfein to Join Obama Immigration Meeting</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama is trying to rally business support for his immigration proposals at a White
            House meeting today with a dozen chief executive officers, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Lloyd
            Blankfein and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)'s Marissa Mayer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama is pressuring Congress to act by
            mid-year on comprehensive immigration legislation that would include a path to citizenship for many of the
            11 million undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I couldn't think of a better
            topic that will galvanize a lot of the resources necessary in the country to improve the competitive
            effectiveness of U.S. business,' Motorola Solutions Inc. Chief Executive Officer Greg Brown said as he
            headed into the meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama also is lobbying for the support of unions and
            Democratic-leaning activist groups, telling them in a meeting this morning that rewriting immigration law is
            his top legislative priority for the next few months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are all on the same page,'
            said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor federation. He is working with the
            U.S. Chamber of Commerce to find common ground on the issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Republican Objections &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a sign of the hurdles to passage of a new law, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary
            Committee warned today against a 'rush to judgment' on the issue, saying that there are lots of questions
            about how a legalization program would work. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Turns Negative on Turkish Banks as Earnings Peak Seen</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. turned
            negative on Turkish bank stocks, saying it's concerned that
            central bank tightening will hurt earnings while rising U.S.
            Treasury yields lure funds away from the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turkish bank earnings will probably peak this quarter 'and
            then decline sequentially,' Goldman Sachs analysts Dmitry Trembovolsky and Alexey Butylin said in an
            e-mailed report dated
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yapi Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK), part-owned by Italy's UniCredit
            SpA (UCG), is most vulnerable to a retreat in its share price, the
            analysts said. The Turkish bank stock index has gained 42
            percent in the past 12 months, outperforming the 7.8 percent
            gain by the MSCI Emerging Markets Financials Index (MXEF0FN) over the same
            period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yapi Kredi
            shares surged 93 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The governor of the nation's central bank, Erdem Basci, has
            said he'll limit loan growth to 15 percent this year as he
            attempts to reduce the import-driven current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The bear case for Turkish banks concentrates on three
            points: risks to earnings, sizable outperformance over the past
            12 months and rising U.S. yields,' Goldman Sachs (GS) said. 'As
            U.S. 10-year Treasury yields have moved to 2 percent, the key
            bull argument on fund flows has weakened. Repatriation of flows
            into the U.S. has potential to threaten Turkish macro stability,
            and could ultimately result in a much more hawkish Turkish
            central-bank response.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The value of foreign investors' holdings of Turkish stocks
            and bonds fell by more than $1 billion in the week to Jan. 25,
            according to data published by the central bank on Jan. 31.
            Foreign investors purchased $5.9 billion in Turkish stocks and
            $17.3 billion in Turkish bonds in the year to Jan. 25, according
            to the data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Cohn Bullish on China Banks After ICBC Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn said he's 'bullish' on China even after his firm last
            week sold a $1 billion stake in Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the nation's largest bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You can absolutely still make money off Chinese banks,' Cohn, 52, said in an interview with
            Bloomberg Television's Susan Li in Hong Kong yesterday, without naming specific banks. 'We are very
            positive, optimistic, but cautious, about where China's going.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's sale of
            the stake followed an almost 50 percent advance in ICBC stock from its 2012 low. Investing in local lenders
            in China has reaped bigger profits for foreign banks than operating their own franchises in the world's
            second- largest banking market. BNP Paribas SA in December said it plans to increase investments in Bank of
            Nanjing Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm sold part of an investment first made in January 2006
            when Goldman Sachs and client funds it manages agreed to invest $2.58 billion in Beijing-based ICBC. The
            U.S. bank and the funds have since offloaded ICBC shares at least five times, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show, and the New York- based firm has recorded more than $3.1 billion of gains on its proprietary holding,
            according to company filings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the latest transaction, Goldman sold 1.35 billion
            shares at HK$5.77 each, 3 percent lower than the Chinese lender's HK$5.95 closing price in Hong Kong on Jan.
            28. It continues to hold more than $1 billion of ICBC stock, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Very Happy'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We will continue to be invested in China,' he said. 'It's been an important strategic
            relationship with them for a long period of time and we're very happy being shareholders of ICBC.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global financial firms including Temasek Holdings Pte, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.
            invested a combined $33 billion in Chinese banks from 2001 to 2009, according to data compiled by the China
            Banking Regulatory Commission. Profits at the biggest local lenders, which are controlled by the government,
            have since defied the global economic slowdown and risen to a record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earnings at ICBC,
            the world's biggest lender by market value, probably gained 10 percent to 229.7 billion yuan ($36.8 billion)
            last year, according to the average estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That would mark its seventh
            year of record profit since becoming publicly traded in 2006. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although shares of Hong
            Kong-listed Chinese lenders have rallied since mid-September as the U.S. announced a third round of
            quantitative easing, they continue to trade at close to record-low valuations on concern that non-performing
            loans will rise. ICBC is trading at about 6.7 times its estimated earnings for 2013, compared with 11.2 for
            Goldman Sachs and 9.1 for JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chinese banks are set to report
            fourth-quarter results next month and first-quarter earnings in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Russia Hires Goldman as Corporate Broker to Boost Image</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) has been
            hired by the Russian government to burnish the nation's image
            overseas and attract more institutional investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has signed a three-year agreement with the Economy
            Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to advise on
            issues such as communicating government decisions and setting up
            meetings with investors, according to Sergei Arsenyev, Goldman
            Sachs's managing director of investment banking in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The pool of investors that Russia talks to is the
            dedicated emerging-markets base, and it's been difficult for
            them to break out to a wider investor pool and a global base,'
            Arsenyev, 41, who handles the bank's Kremlin relations, said in
            a telephone interview. 'We think valuations in Russia remain
            very attractive, and there are many interesting opportunities
            for investors on the public and private side.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin last year ordered the government
            to improve Russia's standing in the World Bank's Doing Business
            rating to 20th by 2018. It climbed eight positions to 112 in the
            latest study in October. While that's better than emerging-
            market competitors India and Brazil, Russia remains the worst
            among major economies in graft, Transparency International said
            in December in its annual Corruption Perceptions Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't know how to communicate with investors,' Deputy
            Economy Minister Sergei Belyakov told reporters last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Privatization Push &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy exporter plans to raise a record
            $10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime
            Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an interview with Bloomberg
            Television last month. While corruption continues to be an
            issue, it's less so for foreign investors who have already
            committed to Russia, Shuvalov said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of 23 foreign and domestic banks
            selected to advise Russia on its 1 trillion-ruble ($33 billion)
            privatization program. Last year it helped advise OAO Sberbank,
            Russia's largest lender, on a $5.2 billion equity sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement with the Kremlin 'is similar to a corporate
            broking arrangement, which every FTSE 100 company has,' said
            Arsenyev, who switched to investment banking a year ago after 17
            years in research. 'It's to make sure the market message is
            crystallized. Our work is strictly limited to the investor base
            and making sure the government is meeting the right people.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Promoting Moscow &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;British companies typically hire corporate brokers to serve
            as a liaison with investors and to help them comply with stock
            market rules. The assignments, compensated with a nominal fee or
            sometimes unpaid, can lead to more lucrative business such as
            managing share deals and advising on mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal also includes advising Russia on its bid to
            transform Moscow into an international financial center and to
            attract more capital, Arsenyev said. Moscow ranked 64th on the
            Global Financial Centers Index in September, a survey compiled
            by Z/Yen Group, a London-based consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's premier financial centers have succeeded
            because of 'good rule of law,' Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
            chief executive officer, said at last month's World Economic
            Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You want to go into a place that's fair, where if you
            make an investment you can recover your investment,' he said at
            a panel discussion. 'You can go into the U.K. and sue the U.K.
            government and have a reasonable chance that a court will decide
            that fairly. There are other places where I think people
            implicitly know they can't.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman's Struggles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, who is a member of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's advisory committee for turning
            Moscow into a
            financial center, has struggled to build a business in Russia.
            The New York-based bank scaled back operations in Moscow soon
            after opening an office in 1994 amid a worldwide retrenchment.
            It returned in 1998, managing Russia's sale of bonds a month
            before the country defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.
            That prompted it to withdraw almost entirely before ramping up
            again in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since the default, the bank has been overlooked by Russia
            for three sovereign bond deals in 2010 and 2011 and $7 billion
            in euro bonds last year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Russia could borrow as much as $7 billion this year,
            according to the budget. The government is prepared to wait for
            companies to meet their borrowing needs to avoid crowding the
            market, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in a Dec.
            24 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, along with BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Singapore-
            based Templeton Asset Management Ltd. signed an accord with the
            Russia's sovereign private-equity fund in June to invest in
            Russian companies preparing for initial public offerings. The
            fund is led by Kirill Dmitriev, a former Goldman Sachs banker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. securities firm is led in Moscow by Paolo Zannoni,
            who took over last year from co-heads Chris Barter and Jean Raby. Barter left the firm to set up a
            private-equity group,
            while Raby returned to France with Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zannoni, who had been chairman of Italian investment
            banking, previously worked in the former Soviet Union for Fiat
            SpA. He had been sent to Moscow in the early 1990s by then
            chairman Giovanni Agnelli to buy Russian carmaker OAO AvtoVAZ,
            which was supposed to be privatized. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Moscow Exchange's valuations trail the biggest emerging
            markets, while Russian issuers prefer to sell equities in
            London. Russia's benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) has gained 4.5 percent
            this year, beating the MSCI's Emerging Markets Index's 1.1
            percent advance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrey Kostin, chairman of VTB Group, Russia's second-
            biggest bank, said on Nov. 15 that the country was undervalued
            'because of its image of corruption and lack of necessity to
            comply with law.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies on the Micex Index have an average valuation of
            5.9 times estimated earnings, compared with 16.6 for India's BSE
            Sensex Index (SENSEX), 19.9 for Brazil's Bovespa (IBOV) and 13.4 for China's
            Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP), data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Colombia Says Goldman Seeks to Sell Bonds Backed by Roads</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
            to sell bonds backed by Colombian highways, to help construction
            companies raise money for the country's 47 trillion-peso ($23
            billion) road-building program, a government official said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luis Andrade, head of the Colombian infrastructure agency
            ANI, said in an interview in Bogota that Goldman Sachs is
            proposing the bond sales to supplement the costs that builders
            are willing to bear and what banks are willing to lend. The New
            York-based bank would package the bonds so they're backed by
            future proceeds from the highways, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The bottleneck for these projects is going to be
            financing,' Andrade said. 'Of the investment banks, the one
            that's been most attentive, and has put in time coming up with
            ideas, is Goldman Sachs.' The New York-based firm is talking
            directly with builders, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn't
            respond to an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has promised
            the road projects as a way to stimulate economic growth,
            builders have struggled to line up financing. Last week, ANI
            extended the bid-submission deadline for the first project by a
            month to March 7, after the country's banking association said
            project bidders needed more time to complete their proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the new program, builders must finance projects
            themselves and recoup their investments later through toll-road
            collections and government payments. The country previously had
            made upfront payments to builders, a practice that led to
            allegations of corruption and inefficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Extra Month &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the 10 approved bidders for the first project -- a
            road from Puerto Salgar to Girardot in central Colombia -- were
            ready to submit proposals by the original Feb. 7 deadline,
            according to Andrade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A couple of the firms told us they were ready and even
            that they were interested in going ahead because they knew that
            others weren't,' Andrade said. 'We want ample participation
            and of good quality, and if we see that because of timing we
            won't get it, then we'll give a little bit more time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ANI will use the extra month to make 'small
            adjustments' to the contracts on the concessions, and the
            government is studying whether to increase the fraction it pays
            builders in dollars instead of the local currency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're considering offering to pay more of it in dollars,
            so that they can take on more debt from outside sources,'
            Andrade said. 'It varies from project to project. We're seeing
            how we can get it higher so that more or less 30 percent of the
            project can be financed in dollars.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;World Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's development bank, Fondo de Desarrollo Nacional,
            is also planning to announce by Feb. 14 the prices and
            conditions under which it will lend to the projects, Andrade
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia is expecting banks and institutional investors to
            finance a combined 28 trillion pesos, Andrade said, with the
            government willing to fund 6 trillion pesos through its
            development bank. Another 4 trillion pesos would come from
            multilateral agencies such as the World Bank's International
            Finance Corp., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Colombian development bank may provide subordinated
            loans to the projects for as much as 15 percent of the total
            cost, Clemente del Valle, the bank's president, said last week
            in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold C$600
            million ($541.5 million) of Canadian dollar-denominated debt in
            the year's initial sale of what are known as Maple bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank, which had initially come to market
            with C$350 million of notes, increased the size of its seven-year offering and priced the debt to yield 173
            basis points over
            benchmark Canadian government bonds, according to a term sheet
            seen by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coupon was 3.55 percent and the securities yielded
            3.568 percent with ratings of Baa1 from Moody's Investors
            Service and A- from Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes' yielded more than the 2.3 percent average
            effective yield in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Single-A
            U.S. Banking Index, where the average maturity is 6.1 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It was Goldman's first Canadian issue since January 2013,
            when it's C$650 million of notes were sold with a coupon of
            3.375 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Maple bond market, nicknamed for the nation's maple-leaf flag, regained some investor
            acceptance after deal-making
            froze in 2008 following government bailouts of banks that were
            among the biggest issuers, reaching C$6 billion in 2012 and C$5
            billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian subsidiary of Wells Fargo Co., sold C$1.25
            billion of seven year notes Jan. 23, with a coupon of 3.04
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Currency Traders Cho, Lim Said to Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Steven Cho and Leland Lim, Goldman
            Sachs (GS) Group Inc. partners in its currency-trading business, have
            left the firm, according to a person briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cho was global head of spot and forward trading of G-10
            currencies in New York, while Lim was co-head of macro trading,
            which includes interest-rates and currencies, for Asia ex-Japan,
            said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the
            departures weren't public. Cho and Lim were both named partners
            in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are probing whether traders at the world's
            largest banks colluded through instant-message groups to
            manipulate benchmarks such as the WM/Reuters rates. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined
            to comment on whether the departures were related to any probe.
            Cho didn't return a call for comment, while Lim didn't respond
            to an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
            investment banks declined 6 percent in the first nine months of
            2013, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd.
            Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the
            currency business had 'difficulty managing inventory' in the
            third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income trading
            revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cho worked under Guy Saidenberg, Goldman Sachs's global
            head of foreign-exchange trading, who remains in his role, the
            person familiar with the matter said. Cho joined the firm in
            1996 after previously working at Citigroup Inc., according to a
            biography on the website of the nonprofit organization Apex for
            Youth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswire reported Cho's departure earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Three banks climbed to the top of the merger rankings within 24 hours after landing roles on this
            year's two largest deals valued together at almost $50 billion, as a mergers and acquisition recovery
            gathers strength. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) have taken the lead, displacing Barclays Plc (BARC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) and
            vaulting Goldman to first place from third, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LionTree Advisors LLC,
            a boutique founded last year, won the lead role advising Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) in its $23.3 billion
            takeover of U.K. cable operator Virgin Media Inc. (VMED) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The three large lenders won
            advisory roles on the Liberty Global (LBTYA) deal and the bid to take Dell Inc (DELL). private in a
            transaction valued at $24.4 billion. The equity value of those deals accounts for about one-eighth of the
            $205 billion announced so far this year in an MA recovery that may be gathering speed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I
            am surprised the MA recovery has taken so long,' said Philip Keevil, a partner at New York-based Compass
            Advisers Group LLC, which is merging with Richmond Park Partners to form Compass Partners. 'I do think you
            are going to see an increase in deals where companies in one market want to be in more than one market, or a
            No. 3 player in a particular market is seeking acquisitions to become No. 1.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The head of Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc.'s operations in Germany and the country's second-highest
            ranking bank regulator will testify at the trial of former
            managers of Sal. Oppenheim Jr. Cie this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Alexander Dibelius will give evidence on
            Feb. 12 at the tribunal in Cologne where the case is being
            heard, according to the court's witness list. Frauke Menke, the
            head of banking supervision at Bafin, is scheduled to testify
            Feb. 20, the same day as Thomas Middelhoff, the former chief
            executive officer of Bertelsmann AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former Sal. Oppenheim managers are charged with breach
            of trust over bad investments, including property deals
            prosecutors say resulted in about 150 million euros ($204
            million) of losses. The court is also reviewing loans to
            Arcandor AG (ARO), a German retailer which went bankrupt in 2009, in
            the trial, which began last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ben Fisher, a spokesman for Bafin, said he didn't know what
            Menke's testimony would be about. A spokesman for the Cologne
            court, Achim Hengstenberg, said he couldn't comment on the
            subject of the testimony. The court is reviewing allegations
            over the Arcandor investment at the moment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sal. Oppenheim put itself up for sale after reporting a
            2008 loss of 117 million euros, its first yearly loss since
            World War II, from investments in real estate and companies.
            Deutsche Bank AG bought the family-run lender, founded in 1789,

        <headline>Goldman Workers Back Kashkari Bid for California Governor</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s current
            and former employees, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary
            Henry Paulson, have helped Republican Neel Kashkari raise almost
            $1 million in his bid for California's governorship. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kashkari, a former Goldman vice president who as a Treasury
            official managed the $700 billion rescue of the U.S. banking
            system, reported $976,000 in contributions since announcing his
            candidacy on Jan. 21. The donations included $79,400 from
            Goldman employees and $54,400 from Paulson and his wife, Wendy,
            according to a filing yesterday with the California Secretary of
            State. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our campaign's robust fundraising in these first two
            weeks underscores Neel's strength as a candidate, and it will
            help ensure that we have the resources necessary to share with
            voters his vision for turning California around,' Pat Melton,
            Kashkari's campaign manager, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kashkari, 40, is running in California's June 3 primary,
            where the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advance to
            the November general election. Also running for governor is
            Republican state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, 47, who raised
            $374,000 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat who hasn't said whether
            he'll seek another term, has $17 million in campaign funds from
            donors including Exxon Mobil Corp., Facebook Inc. (FB) and Microsoft
            Corp., as well as porn mogul Larry Flynt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown was elected in 2010 after having previously served as
            governor from 1975 to 1983. Prior to his second stint as
            California's chief executive, he also was elected mayor of
            Oakland and the state's attorney general. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Equity Work &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After his work in the Troubled Asset Relief Program under
            Paulson, Kashkari joined Pacific Investment Management Co. in
            Newport Beach, California, in 2009, where he led the world's
            largest bond fund's expansion into equities. He left in January
            2013 and has said he spent the past year meeting with almost 700
            potential donors from around the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paulson, a former chief executive officer at New York-based
            Goldman Sachs, and his wife each gave the maximum individual
            contribution of $27,200 under California law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs employees who donated to Kashkari's campaign
            include George C. Lee, II, listed as an executive living in
            Tiburon, California, who gave $27,200; Jon Woodruff, a banker
            from Menlo Park, California, who donated $27,200; and Andrew Gordon, an investment banker from Los Angeles,
            who gave $5,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs employee Matthew L'Heureux of
            Kentfield, California, gave $9,000 and O'Malley Miller, a
            partner at the law firm Munger, Tolles Olson LLP, who has
            represented Goldman Sachs, gave $10,000, according to the
            campaign filing. &lt;/p&gt;

            Inc. equity research analyst who covers oil companies including
            Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and ConocoPhillips, will retire after 15 years
            at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Murti, a partner at the New York-based company who served
            as co-head of equity research in the Americas, will become an
            advisory director, according to an internal memo from Steve Strongin, head of global investment research.
            Leslie Shribman, a
            Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, confirmed the memo and declined to
            comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Murti in March 2005 correctly predicted a 'super spike'
            in the price of oil, which almost tripled from that point to a
            record $147.27 in July 2008. Exxon shares hit an all-time high
            last December as Murti raised his rating to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over the course of his career, Arjun has distinguished
            himself as a leading expert in the energy sector,' Strongin
            wrote in the memo. Murti will continue covering the integrated
            oil and refining sectors while the firm makes plans for his
            successor, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Murti joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and was named partner in
            2006. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China Spurs Market Rout Blamed on Fed, Goldman Sachs AM Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;China's policy shifts are a bigger
            driver of the selloff in emerging markets than the Federal
            Reserve's decision to dial back stimulus, according to Goldman
            Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Volatility will rise toward its long-term average and that
            means an increase in risk premiums, said Philip Moffitt, head of
            fixed income in Sydney for Asia and the Pacific at Goldman Sachs
            Asset Management, which had $991 billion of assets under
            supervision worldwide as of September. The risks for different
            emerging economies will become more idiosyncratic and Mexico
            presents a buying opportunity following the rout, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markets from Turkey to South Africa and Argentina were
            roiled during the past month as investors sold off emerging-economy currencies, stocks and bonds, prompting
            emergency
            measures from governments and central banks. The bout of risk
            aversion follows the Fed's decision to scale back asset
            purchases and China's pledge to rein in leverage and give market
            forces a more decisive role in allocating resources. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The selloff in emerging markets has much more to do with
            China than with Fed tapering,' Moffitt said yesterday in an
            interview in Sydney. 'China's such a big source of global
            demand, in particular for other emerging markets, uncertainty's
            going to stay high and risk premiums should be expanding.' &lt;/p&gt;

            Philip Moffitt, head of fixed income in Sydney for Asia and the Pacific at Goldman Sachs Asset Management,
            said investing in Mexico would be his top trade at the moment because the country's fundamental outlook is
            strong even though it has been affected by the global selloff. Close

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Names Varadhan Co-Head of Trading Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, named Ashok Varadhan as the third
            co-head of that division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Varadhan, the 41-year-old chief of macro trading, joins
            Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet in running the securities
            division, according to an internal memo obtained today by
            Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed the memo's contents.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Varadhan will help run the business that generates the most
            revenue and profit among Goldman Sachs's segments and that has
            produced many of its top officers. He takes over as the trading
            unit faces constraints from new capital rules and has seen
            declines in revenue in three of the past four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He joined Goldman Sachs in swap trading in 1998, and was
            named a partner at age 30 four years later. He was chosen to run
            North American interest-rate products in 2001 and became head of
            foreign exchange in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a long-tenured leader in the securities division,
            Ashok has demonstrated dedication to our clients and a deep
            understanding of our business,' Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn wrote
            in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $15.7 billion in revenue from
            equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13 percent from a
            year earlier. While it set a Wall Street record for trading
            revenue in 2009 as other firms took longer to recover from the
            financial crisis, Goldman Sachs has been passed by fixed-income
            giants JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Greenhill Hires Goldman Sachs's Mello for New Brazil Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Greenhill Co. (GHL) hired Rodrigo Mello,
            a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment-banking executive,
            as a managing director to help build its new business in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mello, 39, will work in the Sao Paulo office for the New
            York-based merger-and-acquisition advisory firm, according to
            Daniel Wainstein, a former partner and chairman of Goldman
            Sachs's Brazil investment-banking business who joined Greenhill
            in October. Mello left Goldman Sachs's investment-banking
            division in November after two stints totaling 14 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Rodrigo Mello is one of the most experienced MA
            executives in Brazil and a banker trusted by our clients,'
            Wainstein said in an interview. 'We are very happy he decided
            to join us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greenhill, founded by former Morgan Stanley President
            Robert F. Greenhill, hired Wainstein, 43, to be the country head
            for its first South American branch. The firm is growing in
            Brazil as some international banks pull back. Goldman Sachs
            halted an expansion there last year, and London-based Barclays
            Plc has been reducing staff in Brazil as competition with local
            lenders intensifies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If a region is going through some cyclical economic
            challenges, it can be an even more opportune time for us to
            recruit,' Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok said in a
            statement in October. 'Brazil will certainly have its ups and
            downs, just like the U.S. market does, but Brazil is clearly a
            large market that will see significant economic growth over the
            long term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hiring Plans &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein is building a team to advise Brazilian companies
            on global transactions. The short-term plan is to hire a senior
            vice president, a vice president and three bankers at the
            associate analyst level, he said in the interview. The office
            already employs five executives, including Wainstein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our goal is to build one of the most important MA
            advisory platforms in Brazil using Greenhill's international
            relationship network,' Wainstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Announced mergers and acquisitions involving companies in
            Brazil increased more than 18 percent to $78.8 billion last year
            from 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before Goldman Sachs, Mello was a private-equity executive
            at Banco Santander SA. He also worked from 2005 to 2007 as chief
            financial officer at Monte Cristalina SA, a holding company
            owned by Joao Alves de Queiroz Filho, founder and the biggest
            shareholder of Hypermarcas SA, the Sao Paulo-based consumer-goods maker. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former Goldman Sachs Partner Said to Plan Macro Hedge Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Leland Lim, who retired as co-head
            of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s macro trading team in the Asia-Pacific region outside of Japan, plans to
            start his own Hong
            Kong-based hedge fund, said two people with knowledge of the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new company aims to start an Asia-focused global macro
            hedge fund around mid-year, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified as the information is private. The fund will trade
            mainly currency and interest-rate instruments, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It joins other Asia-focused macro hedge funds that have
            started in the past year or are in the works to capture rising
            investment opportunities. The Eurekahedge Asia Macro Hedge Fund
            Index gained 9 percent last year, the largest annual gain in
            four years, and outperformed the 8 percent return by the index
            that tracks global hedge funds across all strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Asia-based macro hedge funds have a natural advantage in
            taking information gained from their front-row seats and turning
            that information into trade and investment ideas,'said Ed Rogers, chief executive officer of Tokyo-based
            Rogers Investment
            Advisors. 'Asian economies remain the ones to watch as many
            transition from emerging markets to developed markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Large Diversity' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among others, Whiz Rock Global Macro Investment Fund is
            looking to increase assets to $150 million by March, from $50
            million, Naoki Iwami, a former managing director at Millennium
            Capital Management in Tokyo who now runs Whiz Rock, said in
            November. Former HSBC Holdings Plc economist Geoff Barker plans
            to start a new Asian macro hedge fund in March with City
            Financial Investment Co., he said the same month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Asia offers a large diversity of instruments to express a
            macroeconomic view,' said Stephane Pizzo, managing partner of
            Singapore-based Lotus Peak Capital Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A skilled manager will be able to benefit from
            opportunities including the Japanese quantitative easing;
            China's liberalization and internationalization of its financial
            markets, and the controlled appreciation of its currency; and
            the various monetary and fiscal policies from governments in
            Southeast Asia and India, Pizzo added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The HFRI Macro Index dropped 1.1 percent in January, hurt
            by declining emerging markets, and losses for trend-following
            funds and those that trade with computer models, Chicago-based
            Hedge Fund Research Inc. said in a statement dated Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Leaving Goldman &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lim left Goldman Sachs on Jan. 24, according to his
            licensing record with Hong Kong's Securities and Futures
            Commission. He decided to retire from Goldman Sachs after 17
            years with the New York-based bank, according to an internal
            memo. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
            Sachs, confirmed today the content of the memo dated Jan. 21,
            declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lim, 37, joined Goldman Sachs in New York in 1997 on its
            foreign-exchange options desk and moved to Asia in 1999 to work
            on such instruments in Hong Kong and Tokyo, according to the
            internal memo. He managed foreign exchange and interest-rate
            derivatives trading in the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan
            before his appointment to the latest position in 2012, it added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was promoted to managing director in 2006 and made
            partner in 2010, according to the memo from the bank's co-heads
            of sales and trading Isabelle Ealet and Pablo J. Salame. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Politicized Regulation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs named Hidehiro Imatsu to co-head Asia-Pacific
            macro trading, including interest-rate and exchange products,
            with Stuart Riley, according to a separate internal memo also
            dated Jan. 21. Imatsu was head of macro trading in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lim's departure was not related to regulatory
            investigations in possible rate-rigging at various banks, said
            the people. He will lead investments at his own company, said
            the people said, without naming the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders have been leaving various banks to set up their own
            hedge funds amid tighter regulation, said Peter Douglas,
            principal of Singapore-based GFIA Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because of increasingly politicized regulation, it makes
            sense for traders to establish non-banking pools of capital and
            continue to trade, but in a more flexible environment and
            sourced from third parties rather than their banks,' Douglas
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Partners Exercise $77 Million of 2008 Options</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners
            exercised options awarded at the end of 2008, benefiting from a
            doubling in the firm's stock price since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sixty-four partners exercised options last month that
            yielded them $77 million in shares, after covering the cost of
            the options and some tax withholding, according to a Feb. 7
            regulatory filing. Gregory A. Agran, who runs the New York-based
            firm's commodities unit, received $7.1 million of stock, while
            Steve Strongin, 55, head of global investment research, netted
            $4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In December 2008, Goldman Sachs granted 36 million options
            in an effort to give top performers an incentive to stay after
            the bank reduced pay costs by almost half during the financial
            crisis. That grant was more than five times the number of
            options the firm awarded in the three previous years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The options show that Wall Street employees received
            substantial awards even after the largest U.S. banks accepted
            government support amid the worst credit crisis since the Great
            Depression. They also echo regulators' desire to have bonuses
            tie employee incentives to the long-term performance of the
            bank, as partners have had to wait more than five years to reap
            the gains. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MobileIron Inc., whose software
            helps companies protect data that employees access on
            smartphones, is working with banks including Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. as it prepares for an initial public offering, people with
            knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc are also
            working on the IPO, said the people, asking not to be named
            because the information is private. MobileIron plans to raise
            about $150 million in the IPO, for a valuation of $1 billion to
            $2 billion, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for software that manages data on a variety of
            mobile devices is growing as employees bring smartphones and
            tablets from Apple Inc. to Google Inc. into the workplace,
            instead of relying on company-issued devices made by BlackBerry
            Ltd. MobileIron's biggest competitor, AirWatch LLC, agreed to be
            acquired last month by VMware Inc. (VMW) for $1.54 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of mobile-device management, or MDM, software could
            reach $1.6 billion this year, compared with $784 million in
            2012, according to forecasts by researcher Gartner Inc. Alvaro Monserrat, a vice president at Citrix, said
            at a conference in
            December that the company's primary competition in the MDM
            market is coming from MobileIron and AirWatch, 'who are being
            very aggressive on price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't have anything to share at this time,' Clarissa
            Horowitz, senior director of communications at Mountain View,
            California-based MobileIron, said by e-mail about plans for an
            IPO. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank
            and Barclays declined to comment on the MobileIron IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MobileIron, founded in 2007, has raised about $150 million

        <headline>Gilt Groupe Said to Choose Goldman to Manage Web Retailer's IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt Groupe Inc., an online retailer
            of discounted luxury goods, picked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
            manage its initial public offering, according to people with
            knowledge of the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Timing for the IPO has still not been decided, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement
            hasn't been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;E-commerce IPOs have been rare in recent years as
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) expanded its dominance by focusing on growth --
            building warehouses and lowering prices -- while forgoing
            profit. Zulily Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at
            moms, was an exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily
            is now valued at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S.
            e-commerce company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt, founded in 2007, was forced to cut divisions and
            eliminate jobs after competition emerged for its flash sale
            model, which involves offering limited-time deals at steep
            discounts. The company named former Citigroup Inc. marketing
            head Michelle Peluso as chief executive officer last year,
            replacing co-founder Kevin Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an interview in September with Bloomberg Radio, Peluso
            said that an IPO is 'a likely path for us but we're not in a
            rush.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an investor in Gilt and was part of a $138
            million financing round in 2011, valuing the company at about $1
            billion, that included Japan's Softbank Corp. and venture
            investors General Atlantic and Matrix Partners. The company has
            raised a total of at least $240 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Gilt generated $550 million in revenue, excluding
            businesses it discontinued, up from $450 million the prior year.
            The company was expected to generate cash from operations by the
            end of last year, Peluso said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jennifer Miller, a spokeswoman for New York-based Gilt,
            declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. e-commerce market is expected to climb 15 percent
            this year to $300.6 billion, according to researcher EMarketer
            Inc. Revenue at Seattle-based Amazon is projected to rise 21
            percent to $90 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt's current deals include a pair of Elizabeth James
            womens' sandals for $129, down from $198, and a $449 Hickey
            mens' pinstripe sports coat, down from $895. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Leaving Flash &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some Gilt rivals have moved away from flash sales and
            others are stumbling. Fab.com Inc. stopped its flash technique
            last year, opting instead to let customers track departments and
            products they like, and has cut jobs. Rue La La and Lot18 laid
            off employees and scaled back. Totsy, a flash site aimed at
            moms, liquidated its assets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ventee-Privee.com, a French e-retailer that competes with
            Gilt, plans to more than quadruple revenue in the next decade by
            extending the flash model, founder Jacques-Antoine Granjon said
            this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peluso was CEO of Sabre Corp.'s online flight reservations
            unit, Travelocity, which she helped modernize starting in 2003.
            In 2009, the year she joined the board of Gilt, she began
            working for Citigroup and became chief marketing and Internet
            officer, aiming to make banking technology more consumer-friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Join Citadel in Hedge Fund Migration</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managing directors are leaving for Citadel LLC, joining the
            migration of traders leaving Wall Street banks for hedge funds as lenders pull back from riskier businesses.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Uberto Palomba, Goldman Sachs's co-head of emerging markets trading for Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, will join Citadel's Global Fixed-Income Fund in London, Katie Spring, a spokeswoman
            for the Chicago-based hedge fund, said by telephone. Jonathan Tipermas, who led Goldman Sachs's dollar
            swaps-trading desk, will work for the fixed-income fund in New York, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citadel
            is expanding the fixed-income operation it started after hiring former JPMorgan Chase Co. proprietary trader
            Derek Kaufman in 2008 to widen its range of funds beyond Kensington and Wellington, its two biggest pools.
            The hedge fund has built the unit by hiring from lenders including Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse
            Group AG, which have seen traders leave since the financial crisis of 2008 as regulators press firms to cut
            back their proprietary-trading activities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palomba, 39, joined Goldman Sachs in 2007
            from Morgan Stanley (MS), according to his registration with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority. The
            bank named him a managing director in 2009, according to a Bloomberg News story at the time. Tipermas, who
            is based in New York, joined in 2004 and was named a managing director in 2012. Neither could be reached by
            telephone at their offices, while e-mails were returned. Spokesmen for the bank declined to comment on the
            departures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fixed-Income &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citadel's fixed-income fund, which
            manages $2.2 billion, gained 5 percent in January after climbing about 20 percent in 2013, according to a
            person with direct knowledge of the performance who asked not to be identified because the fund is private.
            Hedge funds fell 0.14 percent on average last month and posted a 7.4 percent gain in 2013, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Kaufman's team also manages money for Kensington and Wellington, the person said.

        <headline>Forint Plunges as Goldman Sachs Warns on Hungary Rate Outlook</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The forint declined the most in a
            week as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said further interest-rate cuts
            will make Hungary vulnerable amid a global sell-off in riskier
            assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint weakened 1.3 percent to 311.83 per euro by 4:55
            p.m. in Budapest, the biggest decline among 24 emerging-market
            currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on the government's
            benchmark three-year bonds rose nine basis points, or 0.09
            percentage point, to 4.91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which in January reduced the
            benchmark rate to a record 2.85 percent in its 18th month of
            cuts, said there was room for further easing after government-imposed energy price cuts sent inflation to
            the lowest in more
            than 40 years. Policy makers are moving out of step with peers
            in Turkey, India and South Africa, which increased interest
            rates to help stem outflows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The erosion in real rates has been the strongest,
            Hungary-specific factor differentiating Hungary from other
            countries in the region in this latest sell-off,' Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at Goldman,
            wrote in an e-mailed
            report dated Feb. 7. The policy stance diverging from peers
            leaves Hungary 'exposed,' Polan wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers will reduce the main rate by 10 basis points
            to 2.75 percent on Feb. 18, according to the median of 10
            economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank will probably deliver a 'small,
            symbolic' rate cut next week before adopting a 'very
            cautious' stance, Polan wrote. Further depreciation beyond
            about 320 to 325 per euro would make an increase in the
            benchmark rate more likely, Polan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hungary's slow price growth will probably make the central
            bank 'dangerously comfortable with the ultra-dovish stance,'
            Luis Costa, a London-based strategist at Citigroup Inc., wrote
            by e-mail today. 'The forint looks quite vulnerable, and it is
            the best/most liquid way to express the glaring monetary policy
            risks in Hungary at this juncture.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Data on Feb. 14 will probably show Hungary's inflation rate
            slowed to 0.2 percent in January from 0.4 percent in the
            previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors say the forint's weakness is connected to the
            central bank's commitment to monetary easing,' Gergely Tardos,
            Budapest-based head of research at OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary's
            largest lender, wrote in an e-mailed report today. 'If euro-forint doesn't rise substantially above 315 and
            the pressure to
            tighten subsides, the Monetary Council will probably cut rates
            again this month.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gilt Groupe, MobileIron Said to Enlist Goldman Sachs for IPOs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt Groupe Inc., an e-retailer, and
            MobileIron Inc., whose software protects smartphones, are
            working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on their initial public
            offerings, said people with knowledge of the deals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt's timing is still being decided, while MobileIron has
            enlisted other banks including Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG
            and Barclays Plc, said people familiar with the companies, who
            asked not to be identified because the deals haven't been
            announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coming IPOs are part of a revival in technology
            offerings that includes the debut of Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc.
            and dozens of other Internet and software companies in the past
            two years. The 14 U.S. companies that raised the most money in
            offerings since mid-February of 2012 are all trading above their
            IPO price, a stretch during which the Nasdaq Composite Index has
            jumped 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When you have companies consistently coming to market and
            performing well in the after market, more and more companies
            keep coming,' said Sharon Wienbar, a partner at venture-capital
            firm Scale Venture Partners in Foster City, California. 'There
            are a number of substantial technology disruptions favoring
            startups.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even with the surging popularity of technology deals, e-commerce IPOs have been rare as Amazon.com
            Inc. (AMZN) expanded its
            dominance by focusing on growth at the expense of profit. Zulily
            Inc., which runs a shopping site targeted at moms, was an
            exception last year. After its share sale, Zulily is now valued
            at $4.76 billion, making it the third-biggest U.S. e-commerce
            company by market value, behind Amazon and EBay Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New CEO &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt is trying to follow Zulily's lead after new Chief
            Executive Officer Michelle Peluso revamped the company. Founded
            in 2007, Gilt was forced to cut divisions and eliminate jobs as
            competition emerged for its flash sale model, which involves
            offering limited-time deals at steep discounts. The company
            named the former Citigroup Inc. marketing head as chief
            executive officer last year, replacing co-founder Kevin Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an interview in September with Bloomberg Radio, Peluso
            said that an IPO is 'a likely path for us but we're not in a
            rush.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an investor in Gilt and was part of a $138

            declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Devices Galore &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MobileIron, also founded in 2007, has raised about $150
            million from venture investors including Sequoia Capital,
            Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital and Institutional
            Venture Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for software that manages data on a variety of
            mobile devices is growing as employees bring smartphones and
            tablets from Apple Inc. to Google Inc. into the workplace,
            instead of relying on company-issued devices made by BlackBerry
            Ltd. MobileIron's biggest competitor, AirWatch LLC, agreed to be
            acquired last month by VMware Inc. for $1.54 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of mobile-device management, or MDM, software could
            reach $1.6 billion this year, compared with $784 million in
            2012, according to forecasts by researcher Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't have anything to share at this time,' Clarissa
            Horowitz, senior director of communications at Mountain View,
            California-based MobileIron, said by e-mail about plans for an
            IPO. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank
            and Barclays declined to comment on the MobileIron IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012, Gilt generated $550 million in revenue, excluding
            businesses it discontinued, up from $450 million the prior year.
            The company was expected to generate cash from operations by the
            end of last year, Peluso said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. e-commerce market is expected to climb 15 percent
            this year to $300.6 billion, according to researcher EMarketer
            Inc. Revenue at Seattle-based Amazon is projected to rise 21
            percent to $90 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt's current deals include a pair of Elizabeth James
            womens' sandals for $129, down from $198, and a $449 Hickey

            &lt;p&gt;Some Gilt rivals have moved away from flash sales and
            others are stumbling. Fab.com Inc. stopped its flash technique
            last year, opting instead to let customers track departments and

            moms, liquidated its assets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;French Contrast &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ventee-Privee.com, a French e-retailer that competes with
            Gilt, plans to more than quadruple revenue in the next decade by
            extending the flash model, founder Jacques-Antoine Granjon said
            this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilt's offering could boost the New York startup scene,
            which has lacked marquee technology offerings. Video-ad provider
            Tremor Video Inc. (TRMR) has lost more than half its value since going
            public last year, while startups Fab, Foursquare Labs Inc. and
            Etsy Inc. have struggled as private companies. Photo and video
            marketplace Shutterstock Inc. has been the outlier, more than
            quadrupling since its 2012 IPO. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Currency Strategist Stolper Leaving to Form Venture</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Thomas Stolper, chief currency
            strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said he will be leaving
            the firm by early March to set up a venture. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stolper, 45, who joined Goldman in 1999 and became chief
            foreign-exchange strategist in 2009, said in a telephone
            interview that the enterprise will be foreign exchange related. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The London-based managing director said this week the
            dollar will disappoint analysts expecting a broad rally in the
            currency versus major peers as a tapering of Federal Reserve
            stimulus isn't improving the U.S.'s interest-rate advantage. The
            U.S. currency was little changed at $1.3652 per euro at 12:24
            p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stolper correctly predicted the greenback's slide against
            the euro in 2013, and forecasts the U.S. currency will drop to
            $1.40 in six months. That compares with analysts' median
            estimates for a rise to $1.31 by the end of June, and $1.30 by
            the end of the third quarter, according to Bloomberg surveys of
            economists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'During his tenure at the firm, Thomas has developed many
            analytical tools that have become a reference point for

            chief markets economist, and Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of
            macro and markets research, said in an internal memo obtained by
            Bloomberg News. 'He has also helped to elevate the profile of
            Global Markets Research and has served as a mentor to many of
            his colleagues.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
            confirmed the memo's contents and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>A Real Estate Surge Revives Goldman's Doom-Era Bonds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;As they marketed one of the biggest commercial-mortgage bond deals ever in June 2007, just as
            credit markets began to crumble, bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
            (RBS) handed out T-shirts depicting a glass it declared 'half full.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years later,
            after the $7.6 billion of securities plunged in the collapse of the U.S. property market that pushed loans
            included in the deal into default, the glass is filling up. Portions of the deal that have been cut to junk,
            which fell to as low as 16 cents on the dollar in 2008, have jumped about 5 cents in the past month to as
            high as 69 cents, according to traders and investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bonds are rising after
            distressed real estate, including properties in the 2007 deal, sold in an auction for more than their most
            recent appraisals. The sale provides a glimpse of what to expect in the $550 billion market as loan
            servicers work through a pipeline of $66.6 billion of defaulted mortgages funding everything from Manhattan
            skyscrapers to shopping malls in Tennessee. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In many cases the buildings are in fairly
            decent areas -- they were just overleveraged,' said Keerthi Raghavan, a debt analyst at Barclays Plc in New
            York, referring to properties sold in the recent auction. 'This is a chance to wipe the slate clean.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Makes 2014 Aussie Bond Debut as Westpac Plans Issue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is poised
            to become the first U.S. commercial bank to sell bonds in
            Australia this year, while Westpac Banking Corp. is also
            planning a new line of notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is marketing fixed- and floating-rate
            Australian dollar bonds due August 2019 at a yield of about 135
            basis points more than swap rates, according to an e-mailed
            statement today from the issuer. Sydney-based Westpac,
            Australia's second-biggest lender by market value, plans to sell
            five-year securities at a spread of around 95 basis points,
            according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
            be identified because the terms aren't set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
            in Australia with the yield premium over the swap rate on bank
            paper averaging 99 basis points yesterday and 94 on Feb. 7, a
            low unseen since February 2008, according to a Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds in
            Australia since Goldman Sachs's last transaction in July, when
            it priced A$750 million ($670 million) of five-year fixed and
            floating-rate notes at a 170-basis-point spread. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investment banks were one of the strongest performing
            sectors in 2013 and I'd expect the Goldman Sachs deal to perform
            well, although recent emerging-market ructions could damp demand
            a bit,' said Justin Davey, a money manager at BT Investment
            Management Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rabobank, ABN Amro &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dutch lenders Rabobank Groep and ABN Amro NV are the only
            other foreign commercial banks to have come to the Australian
            market so far this year, issuing A$600 million and A$500 million
            of notes respectively last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The August 2018 fixed-rate bond that Goldman Sachs sold
            last year yielded 106 basis points more than the swap rate
            today, Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices show.
            The American bank carries a credit rating of A- at Standard
            Poor's, the seventh highest, and is ranked Baa1 at Moody's
            Investors Service, one level lower. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank Ltd. was the last of the so-called
            four-pillar domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its
            home market, pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures
            in November at a spread of 88 basis points, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Both Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
            ANZ priced five-year securities in October. The last new
            benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac (WBC) was issued in
            January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There haven't been many primary bank issues since the
            latter part of 2013,' BT's Davey said. 'I'd expect there to be
            solid interest for the Westpac transaction given the lack of
            supply and the benign conditions for banks as evidenced by
            recent results announcements from ANZ and CBA.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is managing its own offering along with CBA,
            NAB and Royal Bank of Canada. Westpac is also managing its own
            sale, the person familiar with that matter said. Both
            transactions are expected to price by tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's ReNew in Solar Dash as U.S. Moves WTO: Corporate India</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;India will award permits this month
            to build solar power plants in the first national auction since
            2011 as a trade spat with the U.S. over import curbs deepens. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a company backed by Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., the Tata group, whose businesses span software
            to automobiles, and First Solar Inc. (FSLR), the biggest U.S. maker of
            solar panels, are among 68 bidders vying for projects as India
            seeks clean alternatives to fossil fuels. The winners for the
            750 megawatts of capacity will be announced by the end of this
            month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India plans a sixfold increase in solar capacity that may
            draw $11.7 billion of investment by 2017 as the technology sheds
            perceptions that risks are high. In contrast, banks are slowing
            lending to coal and gas-fired projects hamstrung by a fuel
            squeeze. Rising demand for equipment is also prompting panel
            makers to seek a bigger share of the trade as the U.S. lodged a
            complaint with the World Trade Organization this week against
            India's barriers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The advantage of renewables is that you know that the
            cost is going to be forever,' said Sumant Sinha, chief
            executive officer of ReNew Power, which is backed by a $385
            million investment from Goldman Sachs. 'You lock in the price
            today. You're not impacted by the rupee's depreciation. There's
            no fuel risk.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Yarn Maker &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three years ago, India's first national solar auction drew
            skepticism with record-low bids from a woolen yarn maker and
            animation company. Tata Power Co. shunned that tender, saying
            banks wouldn't loan to projects deemed too risky. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The current tender received bids for more than double the
            capacity available. The offers include 100 megawatts by ReNew,
            150 megawatts by a unit of India's Infrastructure Leasing
            Financial Services Ltd. and 40 megawatts by Tata Power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The growth of the industry has boosted inbound shipment of
            photovoltaic gear, with the value of the purchases reaching $2.4
            billion since 2010 when India started its solar program,
            according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In order to help local makers of solar modules including
            Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI), India is requiring half of the capacity
            being auctioned to be built with locally made equipment. That's
            375 megawatts or about 10 percent of the total capacity India
            has offered in the past year. The U.S. said this rule unlawfully
            restricts access to American manufacturers such as First Solar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India said it will dispute the complaint lodged by the U.S.
            with the WTO against the 'unfair barrier to U.S. exports.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Offsetting Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India is offering as much as 18.75 billion rupees ($302
            million) in grants for the first time to solar developers to
            offset project costs. That will enable the plants to reduce the
            electricity tariff to 5.5 rupees a kilowatt-hour, equal to the
            cost of grid power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That eliminates one of the main investment hurdles the
            industry faced: the risk that cash-strapped state utilities
            buying the power would default, leaving plants unable to sell
            their output elsewhere. At 5.5 rupees, the plants could find
            alternate buyers, including industrial and commercial consumers
            who pay the highest rates for power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Renewables are attracting a different class of investors
            who want stable yields,' said Sunil Wadhwa, chief executive of
            ILFS Energy Development Co., a developer of gas, coal and
            clean-energy projects. 'These are stable cash flows. For the
            investor, the costs are highest in the beginning, but it's more
            predictable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stable Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clean energy projects in Europe are luring institutional
            cash as retirement and insurance funds, including Allianz SE,
            Aviva Plc (AV/) and PensionDanmark A/S seek stable returns to match
            their long-term liabilities. Copenhagen-based PensionDanmark has
            invested about $1.8 billion in renewable energy, while Allianz
            Capital Partners, a unit of Europe's largest insurer, invested
            more than 400 million euros ($545 million) last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In India, investors from Goldman to Morgan Stanley (MS) have led
            about $2 billion of private-equity buyouts, project and company
            acquisitions in the renewable industry since 2010, according to
            Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In the past year, the Government
            of Singapore Investment Corp. invested 100 million pounds ($166
            million) in Greenko Group Plc (GKO), a developer of Indian wind farms.
            GE Energy Financial Services invested 2.57 billion rupees in a
            hydropower plant in northern Sikkim state under development by
            Gati Infrastructure Pvt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Photovoltaic plants in India are likely to earn a 16
            percent return, according to calculations by the central
            electricity regulator to set tariffs. That compares with a yield
            of 8.87 percent offered by India's benchmark 10-year bond. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Thermal Power &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign direct investment in India's thermal power sector
            has collapsed to less than one-third its level two years ago as
            fuel risks, regulatory uncertainties and environmental delays
            hold up projects, according to government data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent of power stations owned by NTPC Ltd.,
            the nation's biggest generator, are running below capacity due
            to a lack of coal supply, NTPC Director A.K. Jha said this week.
            India plans to raise local gas prices by as much as 90 percent
            to $8 per million British thermal units, a level that will be
            unviable for power plants, Oil Secretary Vivek Rae said on Jan.
            12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With coal and gas prices rising and an increasing share to
            be imported, a clean-energy project may already be able to
            supply electricity about 3 percent cheaper over the long term,
            said Wadhwa of ILFS Energy, which is building a 750-megawatt
            gas power plant and is India's second-biggest owner of wind
            farms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Indonesia, the biggest coal supplier to India, banned
            exports of raw ores last month. 'Tomorrow it might be coal,'
            said Wadhwa. 'In thermal, you're never sure.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Eaton Vance Hires Goldman Sachs's Perkin to Run Equity</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Eaton Vance Corp. (EV), the money manager
            known for its focus on tax-efficient investing, appointed
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Edward J. Perkin as chief
            equity investment officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perkin, 42, former chief investment officer for
            international and emerging markets equity at Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management, replaces Duncan W. Richardson, who retired in
            October after 26 years with Eaton Vance, the Boston-based firm
            said today in a statement. Perkin will join April 29 and report
            to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas E. Faust Jr. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perkin 'brings a record as an outstanding value stock
            investor and a skilled leader of investment teams,' Faust said
            in the statement. 'I am confident that, under Eddie's
            leadership, our equity group can deliver superior results for
            the clients we serve.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perkin led a team of 50 investment managers and analysts in
            Goldman Sachs's London office. Eaton Vance is pushing for
            approval from regulators for a product that would combine the
            flexibility of actively managed mutual funds with some of the
            cost savings and ease of trading of exchange-traded funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Suneil Mahindru will take over at Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management as chief investment officer of international equity
            and Prashant Khemka will be CIO of emerging markets equity,
            Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before heading international and emerging market equity,
            Perkin was a money manager and analyst at Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management specializing in finding undervalued stocks. Perkin
            has a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Santa
            Barbara and an MBA from Columbia Business School. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eaton Vance managed $278.6 billion in assets as of Jan. 31,
            the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Joins Westpac With Biggest Australian Bonds in Two Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Westpac (WBC)
            Banking Corp. sold their largest Australian dollar-denominated
            bonds in more than two years today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the first U.S. commercial bank to come to
            the Australian market since July, issued A$950 million ($855
            million) of notes maturing in August 2019 to yield 130 basis
            points more than swap rates, a person familiar with the matter
            said, asking not to be identified because the terms are private.
            Westpac, the third-biggest issuer of bank debt in Australia last
            year, priced A$3 billion of five-year securities at a 94-basis-point spread, according to an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
            in the South Pacific nation with the average yield premium on
            bank paper over the swap rate at 98 basis points yesterday and
            94 on Feb. 7, a low unseen since February 2008, according to a
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. Today's unsecured bond
            sales, the largest in Australia this year, were also accompanied
            by a A$2.5 billion securitized issue from Commonwealth Bank of
            Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'More than A$6 billion of issuance on one day is massive
            for the Australian market,' said Ken Hanton, a director in
            National Australia Bank Ltd.'s debt markets group. 'The level
            of demand we have seen is a clear demonstration of the health of
            the market at the moment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman transaction was split into a A$700 million
            fixed-rate portion and a A$250 million floating-rate component,
            the person familiar said. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds
            in Australia since Goldman's last deal in July, when it priced
            A$750 million of five-year fixed and floating-rate notes at a
            170-basis-point spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based company raised A$600 million in November
            2012 and A$1.25 billion in May 2011, its first Australian
            offering following a five-year hiatus. The American bank carries
            a credit rating of A- at Standard Poor's, the seventh highest,
            and is ranked Baa1 at Moody's Investors Service, one level
            lower. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Westpac's sale was also a two-part deal, comprising A$1.1
            billion of fixed-rate notes and A$1.9 billion of floaters. The
            last transaction from the Sydney-based lender larger than that
            was in January 2012, when Westpac borrowed A$3.1 billion via its
            debut domestic covered bond, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. It's rated higher than Goldman Sachs, with scores of
            Aa2 at Moody's and AA- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Domestic Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NAB was the most recent of the so-called four-pillar
            domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its home market,
            pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures in November at
            a spread of 88 basis points, the data show. The last new
            benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac was issued in
            January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CBA (CBA), the nation's biggest lender, also priced A$2.5 billion
            of residential mortgage-backed securities today. It sold A$1.4
            billion of class A1 floating-rate notes at a yield 80 basis
            points above the bank-bill swap rate, A$610 million A2 class
            floating-rate notes at a 90-basis-point spread and A$300 million
            A3 class fixed-rated securities at a 110 basis-point spread, a
            person familiar with the matter said. Pricing on a further A$201
            million of notes wasn't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Spain Picks Goldman Sachs to Advise on Sale of Bankia Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Spain picked Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. to advise on the sale of Bankia (BKIA), the lender whose collapse
            in 2012 pushed Spain into a European bank bailout, and agreed to
            pay the U.S. bank one euro ($1.37) in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will analyze strategies for divesting the
            government's stake in Bankia, the state bank restructuring fund,
            known as FROB, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
            investment bank, which previously worked on the government's
            plan to recapitalize Bankia in 2012 and 2013, will charge 1
            euro, said three people familiar with the information who asked
            not to be identified because the terms aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Real estate-linked losses at the Bankia group helped push
            Spain into seeking a 41 billion-euro ($56.2 billion) bailout
            from Europe in 2012 as concern mounted that the cost of
            salvaging it and other former savings banks would overwhelm
            government finances. Bankia's Chairman Jose Ignacio
            Goirigolzarri signaled earlier this month that the government
            was preparing to sell off its stake in the lender that was
            recapitalized with 22.4 billion euros of public funds and that
            the process may take more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman Sachs in Madrid, who asked not to
            be identified in line with company policy, declined to comment
            on the fee structure for the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bookrunners for the U.K. government's sale of 3.2
            billion pounds ($5.4 billion) of shares in Lloyds Banking Group
            Plc in September agreed to charge U.K. Financial Investments
            Ltd. no fees for the work, according to the National Audit
            Office. Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase Co. and UBS AG
            were joint bookrunners for that transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bankia group, including its parent company BFA, on Feb.
            3 posted after-tax profit of 818 million euros in 2013, as
            targeted in Goirigolzarri's turnaround plan, compared with a
            loss of 21.2 billion euros in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bankia also sold bonds last month in a sign of renewed
            favor with investors and its shares have gained 20 percent this
            year. The government owns about 68 percent of Bankia. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;8. Barclays 2013 Profit Declines 26%, Missing Analyst Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc reported full-year

            Currencies &lt;/p&gt;

            than half of its revenue from emerging markets, says it's time

            rates to their lowest levels since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;1. Buffett Drives Headline Writers Crazy: Jonathan Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Few things in journalism are more
            amusing than dueling headlines from competing news organizations
            on a big breaking financial news story. And we have some doozies
            to enjoy thanks to a disclosure yesterday by Berkshire Hathaway
            Inc. and Graham Holdings Co., former publisher of the Washington
            Post. &lt;/p&gt;

            Goldberg &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 14 (Bloomberg) -- This is a piece about a photograph I
            took in the gift shop at the Dachau concentration camp a couple

            &lt;p&gt;3. Buffett Pal Munger Is Head of Very Weird Company: Jonathan

            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Charles Munger is the chairman of
            Daily Journal Corp., a small California newspaper publisher. He
            also is Warren Buffett's longtime business partner and Berkshire
            Hathaway Inc.'s vice chairman. So it's understandable why many
            investors would be curious to know what stocks Daily Journal
            owns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Sure Winners in 2020 Tokyo Olympics? Gangsters: William Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Feb. 12 (Bloomberg) -- As Japan bets on a big economic
            boost from the 2020 Olympics, it might be dismayed by what's
            happening right now in Russia. Moody's doubts the Sochi Games
            will be much of a plus for that economy. &lt;/p&gt;

            is arguably the most immediate social and economic challenge

            Yellen delivers her semi-annual report on monetary policy before

            create a mesh gown for Dita Von Teese made of 'articulated

        <headline>Goldman Names Arsenyev, Sedov Russia Investment Banking Co-Heads</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (G) named
            Sergei Arsenyev and Dmitri Sedov as co-heads of its investment
            banking division in Moscow, according to an internal memo
            obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arsenyev, who joined the New York-based bank in 2000, is
            focusing on coverage of the government and family offices, the
            memo said. Sedov, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2007, is 'MA
            captain for Russia' and is focusing on telecommunications,
            media, technology, infrastructure, industrials and healthcare in
            the region, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Sergei and Dmitri will be working closely with Paolo Zannoni and Nick Jordan in their roles of
            co-chief executive
            officers of the Russia/Commonwealth of Independent States
            business,' said the memo, signed by co-heads of investment
            banking Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. Monika Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in
            Frankfurt,
            confirmed the memo's contents by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appointments come a year after Goldman Sachs was hired
            by Russia's Economy Ministry and the Russian Direct Investment
            Fund as 'a corporate broker' to burnish the nation's image
            overseas and attract more institutional investors. Jordan was
            hired from UBS AG as co-head of the Russian business to work
            alongside Zannoni last March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also named Tim Talkington as head of its Russian
            securities unit, according to another memo. Talkington joined
            Goldman Sachs in 2000 in London and rejoined the firm in Moscow
            in 2007. He was named head of equities for Russia in 2012.
            Schaller also confirmed his appointment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Is Outpaced by Rivals as Equity Sales Jump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, lost market share in equities
            revenue relative to the world's top firms last year, according
            to Tricumen Ltd., a financial research company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's share of total operating revenue from
            equities in 2013 dropped 4.1 percent from the previous year,
            while sales by the bank's peer group rose a combined 15 percent,
            Tricumen said in a report published today. UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland's
            biggest bank, expanded its share by 1.4 percent, the largest
            gain in the group, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost ground in equity derivatives due to its
            limited range of services and products compared with No. 1
            competitor JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), said Darko Kapor, a partner at
            London-based Tricumen. Goldman Sachs fell to sixth from the
            second rank by revenue in equity derivatives last year, and to
            third from second in servicing hedge funds, according to
            Tricumen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, reported $15.7 billion in
            revenue from equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13
            percent from a year earlier, hurt mostly by interest-rate and
            currency trading. In stocks, it remained the leader for cash
            equities last year and is also the No. 1 in proprietary trading
            by revenue, Tricumen data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tricumen uses corporate filings and its own industry data
            to compile the rankings. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Export Rise Slims Rate Cut Odds: Israel Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A rebound in Israeli exports is
            signaling to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) that central bank Governor
            Karnit Flug will resist manufacturers' calls to cut interest
            rates to weaken the shekel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect growth in total exports to pick up to around 4
            percent in 2014,' Kasper Lund-Jensen and Ahmet Akarli, London-based economists at Goldman Sachs, said in a
            report last week.
            Imports will grow by a similar amount, making net impact on the
            shekel 'fairly neutral' and reducing 'the risks of a near-term rate cut,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers say the strength of the shekel, which
            outperformed 30 other major currencies Bloomberg tracked last
            year, was a major reason exports slipped 0.1 percent in 2013.
            They kept their demand for a rate cut even after exports began
            rebounding late last year and the shekel's appreciation stalled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales abroad rose to $4.2 billion in January from $4
            billion in December, according to government data. The currency,
            which gained 7.5 percent last year against the dollar, has
            declined about 1 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of Israel, which has held the rate at 1 percent
            since October, is scheduled to announce its next decision on
            Feb. 24. Sixteen of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
            the bank will hold the rate again, with the rest predicting a
            quarter-point cut. The shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.5090
            per dollar at 5:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Upturn &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's monetary policy committee cited an economic
            pickup and rising home prices when it kept the rate unchanged
            last month. The Manufacturers Association of Israel called the
            Jan. 27 decision 'disappointing' and said borrowing costs
            should be cut to 0.25 percent to weaken the shekel and make
            goods sold abroad more competitive. The Israel Export
            International Cooperation Institute said on Dec. 10 that the
            currency's appreciation dealt exports a 'mortal blow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Davos
            last month that Israeli exporters must adjust to the stronger
            shekel because policy makers have limited options to curb it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government today announced measures to aid exporters,
            including raising the ceiling on export guarantees, expediting
            approvals of export risk insurance and allocating 50 million
            shekels ($14.2 million) to market goods abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While exports have rallied in recent months, imports have
            climbed more, widening the trade gap to $1.5 billion in January
            from $1.2 billion a month earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Benefit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rise in exports, if maintained, will benefit equity and
            bond markets, said Jonathan Katz, a Jerusalem-based economist at
            HSBC Holdings Plc. 'The export figures were pretty broad-based
            and varied, not limited to one sector like pharmaceuticals or
            technology,' Katz said. 'So although so far it's just one
            robust number, if exports and domestic demand continue trending
            upwards, it will be good for companies and the whole economy and
            eventually the markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank has tried to weaken the shekel by stepping
            up its purchase of foreign currency reserves. It bought $1.7
            billion in January, after buying $630 million the previous
            month, bringing its reserves to a record $83.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stabilization of the dollar-shekel rate in recent weeks
            makes it probable the bank will pare its currency purchases this
            month and hold the key rate, said Tal Zohar Avda, chief
            executive officer of the Tel Aviv branch of FXCM Inc. (FXCM) U.S.
            Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen's Feb. 11 comment that she
            intends to maintain the policy of gradually reducing bond
            purchases, also support this view, Avda said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Less Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the dollar continues to strengthen globally, mainly
            against the euro, it will get stronger in Israel, too,' Avda
            said. 'As long as the dollar continues to stabilize or
            strengthen, there will be less pressure from the exporters on
            the Bank of Israel to cut the rate.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman forecasts the bank will hold the rate through the
            first half of 2014, until a continued improvement in exports, a
            gradual quickening of inflation and rising housing prices
            trigger 'a hiking cycle' in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund, in its annual report on
            Israel's economy released Feb. 12, urged the government to rein
            in housing costs by limiting loan-to-value ratios on mortgages
            and raising the property purchase tax for secondary homes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If global growth prospects improve sharply' or
            appreciation pressures on the shekel ease, 'the monetary policy
            stance should be gradually normalized,' the IMF said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Asset Buys Rupee to Join William Blair on Deficit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management and
            William Blair Investment Management are buying the rupee as
            India reins in a current-account deficit that drove the currency
            to a record low in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee, which slid 21 percent in the past two years,
            looks 'cheap' relative to India's improving external finances,
            according to Goldman Sachs Asset, which opened a 'small long'
            position on the currency this year. William Blair has boosted
            the currency to about 20 percent of its foreign-exchange
            holdings for its higher yield and inexpensive valuation, said
            Chicago-based fund manager Brian D. Singer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee has rebounded more than 10 percent from last
            year's all-time low of 68.845 per dollar as India curbed gold
            imports to shore up the current account and the central bank
            acted to spur dollar inflows. Only Indonesia's rupiah has fallen
            more than the rupee among Asian emerging markets. While India's
            finances have improved since last year, the nation needs a
            coordinated plan to respond to volatility in global currency
            markets as the U.S. reduces stimulus, the International Monetary
            Fund said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'current-account numbers have been the key driver
            because it's a very transparent measure of whether the policy
            prescriptions are having an impact,' Philip Moffitt, Sydney-based head of fixed income for Asia-Pacific at
            Goldman Sachs
            Asset, which oversaw more than $1 trillion on Dec. 31, said in
            an e-mail interview yesterday. 'If you can find something
            that's relatively cheap and the fundamentals appear to be
            improving, it's usually a good mix.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Principal Risk' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade will shrink
            to $45 billion in the year through March from an unprecedented
            $88 billion the previous period, the government said Feb. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The principal risk facing India is the inward spillover
            from a tightening of global liquidity interacting with domestic
            vulnerabilities,' the IMF said in the report. Pressures
            associated with India's 'still-significant external financing
            need' could lead to higher borrowing costs, fund outflows and
            'disorderly adjustments' in the exchange rate, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Any plan should make rupee flexibility the key defense and
            include measures to raise the benchmark interest rate, impose
            cash curbs, open foreign-exchange swap windows and raise diesel
            prices, the Washington-based lender said in an annual review of
            India's economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Current Account &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar-based investors will earn 9 percent including
            interest by holding the rupee until the end of 2014, the second-biggest return in Asia, according to
            Bloomberg data based on
            appreciation estimates and deposit rates. Two-year government
            bonds pay 8.67 percent in India, compared with 0.31 percent in
            the U.S. and 3.70 percent in China. The rupee was at 62.23 per
            dollar yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's current-account shortfall decreased to $5.2 billion
            in the third quarter of 2013, from $21.8 billion in the previous
            three months, after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
            raised tariffs on gold in the world's largest bullion-consuming
            nation. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan lured $34
            billion of foreign-currency inflows by offering discounted swaps
            for dollars raised by banks, one of his first steps on taking
            office on Sept. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rajan has also raised interest rates three times so far,
            helping curb consumer-price inflation to 8.79 percent last month
            from as much as 11.2 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Confidence &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Options are signaling increased confidence in the rupee as
            external balances improve and price pressures cool. One-month
            implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
            rate used to price options, has eased to 8.17 percent from last
            year's peak of 22.4 percent in September, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Carry traders, who borrow in currencies with lower yields
            and buy those with higher rates, have earned 4.1 percent on
            rupee investments using dollars since Sept. 30, the most among
            23 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Favorable
            policies will help the rupee and Indonesia's rupiah perform
            better than currencies of other nations with current-account
            deficits such as Brazil, Turkey and South Africa, Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. economist Fiona Lake wrote in a Feb. 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appointment of Rajan, an economist credited with
            presaging the 2008 global financial crisis, as the RBI's head
            encouraged William Blair, which oversaw more than $72 billion as
            of Dec. 31, to boost bullish positions on the rupee, according
            to portfolio manager Singer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The rupee is a cheap currency with significant carry,'
            he said in an interview in Melbourne yesterday. It 'has
            deviated from fundamentals and should not be included in the
            fragile five,' he added, referring to a description used by
            Morgan Stanley last year to describe currencies most vulnerable
            to capital flight. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Turkish Air Said Hires Goldman, Citi to Sell Jet-Backed Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Turkish Airlines has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) to sell debt backed
            by aircraft as it builds a fleet capable of taking on Europe's leading carriers, three people familiar with
            the plan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company aims to sell the enhanced equipment trust certificates this
            year, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the plan is confidential. The amount of
            debt to be sold could approach $1 billion, one person said. Chief Executive Officer Temel Kotil said Feb. 11
            that the company is working on a plan to sell EETCs, without elaborating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EETCs allow
            airlines to issue investment-grade debt at lower yields and transfer the burden of financing fleet orders to
            the bond market. Purchases employing such instruments, which give investors a claim on planes if a carrier
            goes bankrupt, generally involve funding from multiple parties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The securities will
            allow Turk Hava Yollari AO, as the carrier is formally known, to tap EETC investors in the U.S., two of the
            people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Istanbul-based company aims to double its fleet to about 450 planes by
            2020 after last year ordering 117 single-aisle planes from Airbus SAS and 95 from Boeing Co. (BA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turkish Air has embarked on an expansion as it builds its home airport into a long-haul transfer
            hub linking Europe and North America with Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The carrier will boost transit
            traffic to 70 percent of the international total by 2020 from about 40 percent today and should double its
            passenger tally to 100 million, according to Kotil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gulf carriers such as Emirates
            employing a similar model are already capturing traffic from hubs operated by carriers including Air
            France-KLM Group (AF) and Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevnihal Ciftci, a spokeswoman
            for Citigroup in Turkey, declined to comment. Ali Genc, a Turkish Airlines spokesman, wasn't immediately
            available for comment, while Goldman Sachs spokesman didn't reply to calls. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turkish
            Airlines (THYAO) fell as much as 2 percent to 6.77 liras in Istanbul. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman's Gmelich Likens Junk Loans to One-Way Freight Train</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors who have been pouring
            money into funds that purchase leveraged loans need to be wary
            of a reversal in demand, according to Justin Gmelich, the head
            of credit trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's been a bit of a one-way freight train,' Gmelich
            said in a question and answer session, posted on the company's
            website yesterday. 'I would just caution those that are
            involved in the loan space to be mindful of the fact that
            they've been beneficiaries of inflows for 88 straight weeks and
            the tide can turn.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The floating-rate debt, which offers a shield for investors
            from rising rates, has seen unprecedented demand with the funds
            that purchase the debt receiving deposits every single week
            since the summer of 2012. That enabled speculative-grade
            companies to raise $676 billion last year of bank debt, with
            more than 80 percent of that used to escape maturing debt
            deadlines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans in the U.S. have returned 1.2 percent this
            year, after gains of 5.3 percent in 2013, according to the
            Standard Poor's/LSTA Leveraged Loan index. Loans, which are
            ranked higher up in the capital structure than junk bonds in
            case of a bankruptcy, are better protected from rising interest
            rates since they are generally pegged to floating-rate
            benchmarks. The value of a fixed-rate security diminishes with
            an increase in rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rate Protection &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Folks have been shrewd enough to try to protect against
            some of the rate shock,' Gmelich said. 'When you see fund
            flows reverse, irrespective of whether or not the credit quality
            is good, you see a risk retracement.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Retail inflow into loan mutual funds exceeded $63 billion
            last year and have already netted $4.6 billion this year,
            according to a Feb. 20 report from Bank of America Corp.
            Companies have been able to find willing lenders as the assets
            managed by mutual funds investing in the debt swelled to more
            than $150 billion from about $70 billion at the start of last
            year, according to data from the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds
            are rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and lower than
            BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Egol Retires After Heading Team That Made Abacus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Egol, a Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. trader whose desk produced the security that prompted the
            Securities and Exchange Commission to sue the firm, has retired. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egol, 44, left the New York-based bank earlier this year,
            said Michael DuVally, a company spokesman. He joined the firm in
            1998 and was named a managing director in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid a then-record $550 million in 2010 to
            settle an SEC suit over the marketing of a synthetic
            collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. The firm
            created a committee that year to review its business standards
            and practices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Fabrice Tourre, 35, one of the employees under
            Egol, after dropping a plan to file claims against Egol,
            according to interviews with SEC enforcement staff conducted by
            the agency's inspector general. Tourre was found liable in a
            jury trial last year in which the SEC claimed he intentionally
            misled investors in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egol testified in Tourre's trial in July that he was 'not
            aware of any' disclosures to investors that Paulson Co.,
            which stood to make money from the failure of the transaction,
            helped select the assets underlying it. Egol said Tourre did
            tell a superior that the hedge-fund firm run by billionaire John Paulson helped pick the portfolio of 90
            subprime mortgage-backed
            securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the departure earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Posted Losses on 27 Days Last Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generated 46 percent of revenue from sales and trading last
            year, recorded losses from that business on 27 days in 2013, up
            from 16 the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;None of the daily losses exceeded the firm's value-at-risk,
            an estimate of potential losses with 95 percent confidence, the
            New York-based company said today in a filing with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. Traders made more than $100
            million on 34 days, down from 41 days a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's trading revenue fell 15 percent to $16
            billion in 2013, excluding accounting charges, as the firm
            generated less from bond trading and sold a reinsurance unit
            that reported its results in the firm's equities segment. The
            bank's net income climbed 6 percent as Chief Executive Officer
            Lloyd C. Blankfein set aside a lower portion of revenue for pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world's biggest brokerage,
            reported this week that it lost money in its trading business on
            33 days last year, down from 37 in 2012 and the fewest since
            2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, revised its
            gauge of market gains and losses to incorporate new regulatory
            requirements, resulting in a jump in the frequency of losses
            last year. Under the new method, JPMorgan posted gains on 177 of
            the 260 trading days in 2013, while the old measurement showed
            losses on zero days. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's 'Reasonably Possible' Legal Losses Drop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which more
            than doubled the amount it set aside for litigation costs in
            2013, said 'reasonably possible' legal losses beyond those
            reserves were $3.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The figure dropped from $4 billion at the end of the third
            quarter, while rising from $3.5 billion a year earlier, the New
            York-based bank said today in an annual regulatory filing. The
            estimate doesn't include potential claims from investigations by
            the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the
            U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs added some items to its list of activities
            that are subject to current regulatory investigations and
            reviews, including 'allocations of and trading in fixed-income
            securities,' its financial-advisory services and interactions
            between the bank's research analysts and third parties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $962 million of net provisions for
            litigation and regulatory proceedings in 2013, primarily tied to
            mortgage-related matters, up from $448 million in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Awards Employees $2.3 Billion of Restricted Stock</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
            employees restricted stock worth $2.3 billion for their 2013
            performance, the smallest amount in two years as the firm cut
            costs by lowering the portion of revenue it set aside for pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm granted 13.8 million restricted shares that vest
            over several years, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in
            its annual regulatory filing. The value, down from $2.4 billion
            a year earlier, is based on the closing price on Jan. 28, when
            senior executives were given their awards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
            compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the firm went public in
            1999. That
            contributed to a 6 percent increase in net income even as
            revenue was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks have been seeking to balance regulatory pressure to
            tie awards to long-term performance with shareholders' desire
            for flexibility to cut pay costs if needed. Goldman Sachs Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz, 49, has said the firm is
            reluctant to ramp up the amount of pay it defers because it is
            'a bit of mortgaging the future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said about 70 percent of the restricted stock
            awards were recognized as expenses immediately. The cost
            recorded by the firm is probably lower than the current value of
            the shares because the bank accounts for the fact that employees
            can't immediately sell the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world's largest brokerage,
            gave employees $2.72 billion in deferred awards for 2013
            performance, including $1.25 billion of restricted stock and
            $1.47 billion of deferred cash. About $100 million of the awards
            were expensed in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn't disclose any deferred cash awards, and
            the firm hasn't typically given such bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Tesla Consuming Up to 17% of Lithium Output</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla Motor Inc. (TSLA)'s planned battery
            factory may consume as much as 17 percent of current lithium
            output, easing a forecast oversupply and benefiting producers
            like Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The battery plant that Tesla co-founder Elon Musk has
            called a 'gigafactory' could require the equivalent of 15,000
            tons to 25,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually at full
            capacity, Goldman analysts led by Robert Koort said in a report
            today. That estimate exceeds a Feb. 26 Bank of America Corp.
            prediction the facility would use 9,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla today sold $2 billion of convertible notes to fund
            the factory intended to lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries
            used in its vehicles and for power storage. The increasing
            popularity of Tesla's electric cars, which use larger battery
            packs than competing models, should help narrow the coming
            lithium oversupply, Koort wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to see a near-term oversupply scenario as
            likely,' Koort, who rates Rockwood neutral, said in the note.
            'An inflection in pure battery electric vehicles may help ease
            oversupply of lithium around 2020.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Galaxy Resources Ltd. (GXY)'s decision not to resume production
            in Mt. Cattlin, Australia, also contributes to the tighter
            supply outlook, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While companies like FMC Corp. don't get a big portion of
            earnings from lithium, Rockwood is 'positioning for an electric
            vehicle inflection,' Koort said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rockwood is divesting units to focus on lithium products
            and surface treatments. The Princeton, New Jersey-based chemical
            maker gained more access to lithium supplies with its December
            agreement to form a joint venture with China's Chengdu Tianqi
            Industry Group Co. to get a stake in Talison Lithium Pty. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tokyo Bar Heartland Favored by Goldman Bankers Shuts Down</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Heartland, the bar in Tokyo's
            Roppongi Hills complex where bankers from Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. partied before the 2008
            financial crisis, has shut its doors after more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bar, downstairs from the Japan headquarters of Goldman
            Sachs and Barclays Plc (BARC) as well as the former Japan head office
            of Lehman, is closed as of today, Kan Yamamoto, a spokesman for
            Kirin Holdings Co. (2503), said by phone. The Tokyo-based brewer opened
            the bar in 2003 to promote its Heartland-brand beer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The brand has gained enough support from our customers
            now,' with sales growing at more than 10 percent annually in
            recent years, Yamamoto said. There are no plans to move or
            reopen the bar in the immediate future, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Once an exuberant party venue where the champagne started
            flowing at 5 p.m., Heartland suffered a 30 percent drop in
            revenue after Lehman went bankrupt and Goldman Sachs cut back
            staff in Japan, leaving it with fewer customers. The bar in
            recent years saw an influx of new patrons from Google Inc. (GOOG) and
            Apple Inc. (AAPL), both of which moved their Japan headquarters to
            Roppongi Hills as financial firms vacated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heartland and Goldman Sachs were both original tenants in
            Mori Building Co.'s Roppongi Hills development, a complex
            including offices, shops, restaurants, apartments, a hotel, an
            art museum and a movie theater. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, bankers from upstairs would
            order as many as 100 champagne glasses for parties and offer
            them to bar staff and strangers, Mai Shioya, a manager at
            Heartland, said in April last year. After the crisis, customers
            drank less even with new tenants such as the tech companies
            moving into the complex, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In April 2009, after overseas financial companies cut about
            16 percent of their Japan workforce in 15 months, or 4,300 jobs,
            Heartland hosted a 'pink-slip party' to help unemployed
            bankers network and find new jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Sell Won as BOK Easing Likely: Korea Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
            selling the South Korean won and the most-accurate forecaster
            Scotiabank sees possible interest-rate cuts, as exporter
            earnings are wrecked by currency appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman yesterday predicted a 3.1 percent drop in the won
            against the dollar, after a 9.8 percent gain in the past two
            years against the greenback and a 50 percent rally versus the
            Japanese yen. Seven large exporters based their 2014 forecasts
            on an average exchange rate of 10 won per yen, 12 percent
            stronger than last year's 11.23, according to a December survey
            by Korea Trade Insurance Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. reported today fourth-quarter
            profit missed analysts' estimates, after Hyundai Motor Co. last
            week predicted the slowest sales growth in eight years. Bank of
            Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the benchmark rate by a
            quarter-percentage point as early as Jan. 9 to mitigate the
            won's gains and spur growth, Goldman forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Exporters are starting to feel the pinch from the
            exchange rates,' Kwon Goohoon, Goldman's Seoul-based economist,
            said by phone yesterday. 'There seems to be no other immediate
            policy options than a rate cut to support growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Korean exports will see a 'significant' impact should the
            yen fall further, while currency volatility poses the biggest
            risk to Asia's fourth-largest economy, according to minutes of
            last month's central bank board meeting released on Dec. 31.
            Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said on Jan. 3 that the
            authorities are closely monitoring the yen's volatility and
            President Park Geun Hye said the Japanese currency's weakness
            was a burden eroding South Korean companies' competitiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Samsung Earnings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seoul's main bourse got off to the worst start since 2007
            after Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors Corp. on Jan. 2 predicted a
            4.1 percent increase in 2014's combined deliveries, the slowest
            since 2006, and as analysts cut estimates for profit at Samsung
            Electronics. The Kospi index fell 2.6 percent since Dec. 30 as
            foreign investors sold more shares than they bought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won touched 9.96 versus the yen on Jan. 1, the highest
            since September 2008, and fell 0.3 percent to 1,068.46 per
            dollar at 10:16 a.m. in Seoul, having reached a five-year high
            of 1,048 last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares in Samsung Electronics, which got 85 percent of
            sales from outside its home market in 2012, slid 4.8 percent
            this year. Operating profit was 8.3 trillion won ($7.8 billion)
            in the final quarter, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said
            in a statement today. That compares with the 10 trillion-won
            average of 32 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Currency Fluctuations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Samsung Electronics is paying close attention to global
            foreign-exchange trends and strives to protect its interests
            against currency fluctuations,' the company said in a Jan. 3 e-mailed statement in response to questions. It
            couldn't confirm a
            Nov. 29 report by the Korea Economic Daily that the company has
            based 2014 plan on a rate of 1,050 won per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign investors bought a net 3.1 trillion won of Kospi
            stocks last year, while dumping Indonesian and Thai shares,
            exchange data show, as South Korea is positioned to benefit from
            a recovery in the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas shipments, which account for about half of Korea's
            economy, will increase 6.4 percent in 2014, after an estimated
            2.2 percent gain last year, the trade ministry said on Jan. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A stronger won brings down import costs, helping companies
            counter falling overseas income. Steel giant Posco is seeking a
            natural hedge by paying for imports of raw materials in foreign
            currency earned abroad, spokesman Jeong Yong Min said in a Jan.
            3 e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Crying Foul' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smaller exporters with fewer hedging tools are 'crying
            foul over what they see as an unfair advantage Japanese rivals
            are gaining from the retreating yen,' Oh Joo Hyun, Korea
            Trade's head of foreign exchange risk management, said Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. will post a record operating
            profit of 2.4 trillion yen for the year ending March 31,
            according to a Dec. 30 report from the Sankei Newspaper. The
            Bank of Japan, which has embarked on an unprecedented stimulus
            and debased its currency, has scope to expand purchases even
            more, according to 71 percent of economists polled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rising Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Korean policy makers may now become more vocal as risks
            rise in respect to an erosion of Korea's external position,'
            Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Scotiabank, said
            yesterday. 'Risks are rising and I'd be looking for the won to
            weaken off for a bit, particularly given the weaker levels of
            the yen. There is also the rising risk that the Bank of Korea
            eases policy as a counterweight to won strength.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won will decline to 1,070 versus the dollar by the end
            of March, Tihanyi forecasts. That's weaker than the median
            estimate of 1,064 in a Bloomberg survey of 37 strategists. He
            predicted the won will strengthen to 9.54 against the yen at the
            end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman recommended selling the won with a target of 1,100
            per dollar, without specifying a timeframe. The yield on five-year sovereign debt fell five basis points
            this week to 3.26
            percent, amid speculation the Bank of Korea will trim the key
            rate from 2.5 percent. The yield added 26 basis points in 2013.
            All 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no change
            this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer inflation has stayed below the BOK's target range
            of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent since May 2012. South
            Korea's current-account surplus will narrow to $38 billion this
            year after reaching $63 billion last year, while the economy
            will expand 3.8 percent from an estimated growth of 2.8 percent
            in 2013, according to central bank projections. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Korea is a victim of its own success as the economy is in
            better shape than most Asian neighbors,' Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, regional currency strategist in Kuala
            Lumpur at CIMB
            Investment Bank Bhd., said in a Jan. 3 interview. 'The won's
            strength has become a problem for exporters like Samsung. It can
            be quite dangerous and policy makers can't intervene or engage
            in a race to the bottom without causing a reaction elsewhere in
            the region.' &lt;/p&gt;

            division, will report to Adam Silver, the NBA's deputy

        <headline>Goldman Plans IPO of German Homes Unit With $6.1 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
            that sold its stake in Germany's largest department store last
            month, plans to sell shares in a unit that owns homes valued at
            4.7 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An initial public offering of LEG Immobilien GmbH is
            planned for the first half, LEG said in a statement today. The
            sale may raise as much as 1 billion euros, said two people with
            knowledge of the plan. Another person familiar with the IPO said
            it will probably take place in early February. Both people asked
            not to be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG would be Germany's biggest property IPO if it raises 1
            billion euros. The Dusseldorf-based landlord owns 91,000
            apartments in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most populous
            state. Goldman Sachs' Whitehall Street Real Estate fund holds
            about 95 percent of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fundamentals for the segment are very good,' said
            Thomas Martin, an analyst at HSBC Trinkaus Burkhardt AG. (TUB)
            'Because some of their competitors are trading expensively,
            this could be an interesting way for stock investors to get
            in.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Baubecon Bid &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
            in German property. In April 2011, Whitehall Street and Cerberus
            Capital Management LP raised 468 million euros in an IPO of
            Berlin-based residential landlord GSW Immobilien AG. Whitehall
            Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy Baubecon, the
            residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC) agreed to sell
            to Deutsche Wohnen AG in May in a deal valued at 1.24 billion
            euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and LEG co-owner Perry Capital, which bought
            the company from the state government for about 3.5 billion
            euros in 2008, are seeking to profit from a boom in German
            residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit index of German
            property stocks has gained 42 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers
            and bookrunners for the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Annington Immobilien GmbH, Germany's largest owner
            of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington, which has
            186,000 apartments, is controlled by Guy Hands' Terra Firma
            Capital Partners Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in 17 German
            department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the country's
            largest, in December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SocGen Rates Goldman, Deutsche Bank Sell Amid Bond Bear Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should sell Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) because a bear market in bonds
            will hurt trading revenue, analysts at Societe Generale SA (GLE) wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should buy UBS AG (UBSN), while Morgan Stanley (MS) and
            Credit Suisse Group AG were given hold ratings, analysts
            including Andrew Lim wrote in a note today that began coverage
            of the five firms. Fixed-income trading revenue will drop by
            'low-single-digit' percentages, while equity trading climbs by
            the same amount, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve's decision to taper its monthly bond
            purchases probably will lead to lower prices for similar assets,
            the analysts wrote. Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and
            commodity trading, or FICC, probably fell to $73 billion at the
            10 largest global investment banks in 2013, about half the level
            of 2009, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect FICC weakness to be an ongoing structural theme
            -- not a temporary issue -- in a rising U.S. long interest-rate
            environment,' the analysts wrote. More money will move into
            equities 'as investors veer away from the bond bear market,'
            they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulatory limits on leverage will force Goldman Sachs to
            curtail its capital return policy and Credit Suisse (CSGN) to take more
            actions to boost its ratios, the analysts wrote. Goldman Sachs
            and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, probably will show
            they hold more risk-weighted assets after regulators review
            their trading books, pushing down their capital ratios,
            according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, named Dan Dees co-head of the
            global technology, media and telecom group and shuffled managers
            in its Asia-Pacific operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;George Lee, current head of the TMT group, will become the
            unit's chairman, as well as chief information officer for the
            investment banking division, the New York-based firm said
            yesterday in memos to the staff. David Wells, a spokesman for
            the company, confirmed the authenticity of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dees will move from Hong Kong to San Francisco and become
            co-head of TMT alongside Anthony Noto. A former Internet analyst
            and chief financial officer of the National Football League,
            Noto works out of New York. He helped Goldman Sachs win the lead
            underwriting spot on last year's initial public offering of
            Twitter Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dees and Noto will run a group that ranked first in
            advising technology, media and telecom companies on mergers and
            acquisitions. Those industries accounted for more than a quarter
            of deal volume last year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The TMT sectors continue to evolve rapidly on a global

            John S. Weinberg, Goldman Sachs's co-heads of investment
            banking, said in a memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Deutsche Bank Said to Hire Goldman's Malaysia Head Yusof Annuar</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG recruited Yusof Annuar Yaacob, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Malaysia chairman for
            corporate finance, as its country head, according to four people
            with knowledge of the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar, 48, will start work as the German bank's
            chief country officer and head of Malaysian corporate banking
            and securities from the end of February, said one the people,
            who asked not to be named because the information is private.
            His appointment was approved by the nation's central bank last
            week, one of them said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank is building its presence in Southeast Asia as
            economic growth in the region outperforms developed nations. The
            firm handled 208 million ringgit of equity-linked deals in
            Malaysia last year, ranking it sixth among foreign lenders,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The amount is about a
            quarter of second-placed Goldman Sachs's share, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar, a former chief financial officer at Malaysian
            mobile-phone company Axiata Group Bhd., joined Goldman in
            November 2010. The New York-based bank helped manage some of the
            country's biggest initial share sales last year, including
            offerings by Westports Holdings Bhd. and UMW Oil Gas Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman also made about $500 million arranging three bond
            sales for state-owned 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a person
            familiar with the matter said in May 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Candice Sun, a Deutsche Bank spokeswomen in Hong Kong,
            declined to comment by e-mail. Reuters first reported on the
            appointment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yusof Annuar is the latest in several recent key
            appointments by Deutsche in Southeast Asia over the past year.
            It also tapped Tan Boon-Kee, another former Goldman employee, as
            head of client coverage in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Phumchai Kambhato, a former country head of investment
            banking at UBS, joined as head of Thai corporate banking and
            finance. Philip Lee, a former head of Southeast Asia investment
            banking at JPMorgan Chase Co., is now the German bank's vice
            chairman for Southeast Asia and Singapore head. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Swap Fees for Stake in Cantab Hedge Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has taken a
            stake in Cantab Capital Partners LLP after the two firms revised
            the terms of a licensing agreement the hedge fund had used to
            pay the New York-based bank for using its technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cantab paid Goldman Sachs fees as part of a deal when the
            firm started in 2006, according to two people with knowledge of
            the matter who declined to be identified because Cantab is
            private. They restructured it last year, with Goldman Sachs
            giving up the fees in exchange for a minority ownership stake in
            Cantab, they said. Cantab, based in Cambridge, England, told its
            investors of the change in a letter earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As you are aware, we have been spending 2012 building our
            own' information-technology system, Cantab Chief Investment
            Officer Ewan Kirk said in the letter, which was obtained by
            Bloomberg News. 'As part of this, the existing profit-share
            arrangement with Goldman Sachs has been amended and as from
            December 31, Goldman Sachs will become a partner.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kirk, who has a doctorate in mathematics from England's
            University of Southampton, led a team of 120 employees at
            Goldman Sachs focused on quantitative investing before he
            founded Cantab with $60 million. The hedge fund, which relies on
            computers and mathematical algorithms to spot trades, has grown
            to manage $4.7 billion, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Quant Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials at Cantab and Goldman Sachs declined to comment
            on the size of the bank's stake in the hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn't invested in Cantab or paid any money
            for the stake as part of the restricting of the licensing deal,
            one of the people said. The Cantab position isn't held by
            Goldman Sachs' Petershill unit, which uses client money to buy
            stakes in hedge funds, the person added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cantab, which has stopped accepting money from new
            investors, gained 15 percent last year and 13 percent in 2011,
            according to the client letter. Others have lost money as
            political announcements whipsawed markets and broke up the
            trends in asset prices that quant funds try to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Newedge CTA Trend Sub-Index, which tracks the
            performance of the largest computer-driven hedge funds, fell 3.4
            percent in 2012 and 7.9 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Secret Goldman Team Sidesteps Volcker After Blankfein Vow</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sitting onstage in Washington's Ronald Reagan Building in July, Lloyd C. Blankfein said Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) had stopped using its own money to make bets on the bank's behalf. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We
            shut off that activity,' the chief executive officer told more than 400 people at a lunch organized by the
            Economic Club of Washington, D.C., slicing the air with his hand. The bank no longer had proprietary traders
            who 'just put on risks that they wanted' and didn't interact with clients, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
            may come as a surprise to people working in a secretive Goldman Sachs group called Multi-Strategy Investing,
            or MSI. It wagers about $1 billion of the New York-based firm's own funds on the stocks and bonds of
            companies, including a mortgage servicer and a cement producer, according to interviews with more than 20
            people who worked for and with the group, some as recently as last year. The unit, headed by two 1999
            Princeton University classmates, has no clients, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team's survival
            shows how Goldman Sachs has worked around regulations curbing proprietary bets at banks. Former Federal
            Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker singled out the company in 2009, saying it shouldn't get taxpayer support
            if it focuses on trading. A section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker rule, drafted to prevent
            banks from taking on excessive risk, limits short-term investments made with firms' capital. &lt;/p&gt;

            Group Inc. (GS) partner, co-head of Asia Pacific excluding Japan
            securities distribution, and head of structuring in the region,
            will retire, according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, James Houghton, also a partner, will become
            head of Asia Pacific ex-Japan fixed income, commodities and
            currencies distribution, according to a separate memo seen by
            Bloomberg. The contents of both documents were confirmed by
            Connie Ling, a spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kavvathas joined Goldman Sachs in 2001 on the interest rate
            hedge fund sales desk in London and in 2008 became co-head of
            Europe, Middle East and Africa credit flow sales. He took over

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Publish Daily Values for Its Mutual Funds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
            largest U.S. bank by assets, will begin disclosing the daily net
            asset value for its U.S. commercial paper money-market funds as
            regulators are debating an overhaul that would make the vehicles
            safer for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management expects to expand the daily
            disclosure next week to money funds that invest in municipal and
            government debt, the New York-based company said today in a
            statement. The values of the funds as of 3 p.m. will be
            disclosed the following day, Goldman Sachs said in an investor
            update on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a leading provider of liquidity solutions, we believe
            that more frequent disclosure and greater transparency will
            benefit investors,' Goldman Sachs said in the statement. 'This
            will have no impact to how fund shareholders transact or the way
            the funds are managed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators led by former U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro have worked to impose tighter
            restrictions on money funds since the September 2008 collapse of
            the $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund. Proposals to make the
            funds stronger have included abandoning the $1 fixed share
            price, an idea that providers have said would destroy the appeal
            of money-market funds. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Israel Said to Hire Goldman, Barclays to Lead Euro Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Israel is considering selling its
            first euro-denominated bonds since 2010, following Poland,
            Slovakia and Ireland in taking advantage of historically low
            yields as the Federal Reserve begins tapering stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government hired Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to arrange the transaction, according
            to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be
            identified because the information isn't public. The sale may
            take place in the next few weeks, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nations are being drawn by low yields before the Fed
            further reduces its $85 billion monthly bond-purchase program
            after deciding to trim its buying by $10 billion at its most
            recent meeting Dec. 18. Israeli two-year yields were 1.25
            percent today compared with a 10-year average of 3.44 percent.
            Poland sold 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) of 2024 bonds
            yesterday, Ireland issued 3.75 billion euros of 10-year bonds
            Jan. 7 and Slovakia is selling 15-year euro securities today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For European-based investors, it has a nice
            diversification element,' Michael J Roche, an emerging-market
            strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said in a telephone interview
            from New York yesterday. 'It has the faster growth of an
            emerging market, offers extra yield and it is an improving
            credit.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Israel's euro-denominated bonds maturing in
            2020 was little changed at 2.06 percent at 5:42 p.m. in Tel
            Aviv. The country sold the debt on March 2010 to yield 4.7
            percent. The yield on the country's euro-denominated bonds due
            in 2015 rose for the first time in six days, advancing one basis
            point, or 0.01 percentage point to 0.91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corporate Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Israel last tapped international bond markets 12 months
            ago, when it issued $2 billion of 10- and 30-year paper. The
            country is rated A+ by Standard Poor's, the fifth highest
            investment grade, and equivalent A1 by Moody's Investors
            Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shlomi Bidani, a spokesman for Barclays in Israel, and a
            public relations representative for Goldman Sachs who couldn't
            be identified because of company policy, yesterday declined to
            comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Calls made to Citigroup and
            an e-mail sent to the Finance Ministry seeking comment weren't
            returned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate issuers have also been selling Eurobonds, defined
            as securities sold in a currency other than that of the issuer.
            Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil's state-run oil company, issued
            3.1 billion euros of notes Jan. 7 in the company's biggest
            offering in that currency. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BAIC Said to Hire Goldman, Morgan Stanley to Oversee IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Beijing Automotive Group Co., which
            makes vehicles in China with Daimler AG (DAI) and Hyundai Motor Co. (005380),
            hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) for the Hong
            Kong initial public offering of its car unit, three people with
            knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Beijing-based company, known as BAIC, may seek more
            than $1 billion in the IPO as soon as this year, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified because the information
            is private. The IPO would be the biggest by an automaker since
            General Motors Co. (GM)'s $18.1 billion offering in 2010, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BAIC would use IPO proceeds to develop its own brand,
            Chairman Xu Heyi said in September. The state-owned company,
            which traces its roots to making sidecar motorcycles used in the
            Korean War, has said it wants to make 'world-class' cars by
            2025 and hired Ferrari designer Leonardo Fioravanti to help
            improve its brand appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IPO may get pushed into 2014 as BAIC restructures the
            car unit, said one of the people. A press official at BAIC said
            he couldn't immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New share sales by Chinese companies in Hong Kong have
            slowed along with growth in the world's second-largest economy.
            Chinese companies raised $6.4 billion in Hong Kong IPOs last
            year, the smallest amount since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's De Mallmann Buys NYC Apartment for $13 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, a
            London-based partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., bought an
            apartment on Manhattan's Park Avenue for $13 million, 13 percent
            less than what its owners initially sought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal for the four-bedroom co-op at 730 Park Ave., near
            71st Street, was completed on Dec. 26, according to New York
            City property records made public today. The apartment was once
            home to Richard Mack, chief executive officer of AREA Property
            Partners LP's North America division. Mack transferred the
            property in 2011 to his wife, Christine, who was listed as the
            seller, property records show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 4,300-square-foot (400-square-meter) property includes
            a library, a staff room and a hallway 'ideal for displaying
            your art collection,' according to the Corcoran Group brokerage
            listing posted on StreetEasy.com. 'An outstanding layout with
            spectacular entertainment space and grand rooms.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal was completed amid a surge in year-end luxury-home
            transactions made before an expected jump in capital-gains taxes
            on Jan. 1. There were more sales of Manhattan luxury property in
            the last three months of 2012 than in any other fourth quarter
            since at least 1989, when New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc.
            began tracking the data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luxury sales, defined as the top 10 percent of transactions
            by price, jumped 29 percent from a year earlier to 260, based on
            data Miller Samuel collected from public records through Dec.
            31. The figures capture 85 percent of all such deals in the
            quarter and will climb higher as purchases completed in the
            final days of last month are reported with the city finance
            department, said Jonathan Miller, the appraiser's president. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Price Cut &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mack declined to comment on the deal. De Mallmann, Goldman
            Sachs's head of investment banking services in Europe, the
            Middle East and Africa, didn't return an e-mail. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The apartment de Mallmann purchased was first listed for
            sale in April for $15 million, according to StreetEasy. The
            asking price was reduced to $13.5 million in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;De Mallmann, 42, joined Goldman Sachs in 1993 and became a
            partner in 2004, one year after being named a managing director.
            He was head of the European financing group before taking his
            current job in 2011. He has French and Swiss citizenship,
            according to a Goldman Sachs filing in November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jose Fernandez, a managing director
            at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s prime brokerage, joined S3
            Partners LLC, a provider of services to financial firms, as head
            of business development. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fernandez, 47, left Goldman Sachs in April, where he had
            worked for 26 years and was responsible for co-managing the
            prime-brokerage client services team in the U.S., New York-based
            S3 Partners said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;S3 Partners provides services and advice on counterparty
            risk and financing costs to financial institutions, including
            asset managers, banks, pension plans, insurance companies and
            hedge funds. Fernandez will focus on getting new clients and
            serving existing ones, Bob Sloan, managing partner of S3, said
            yesterday in a telephone interview. Fernandez will report to
            Sloan in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;S3, which Sloan founded 10 years ago, advises clients with
            more than $140 billion in assets, he said. Investment banks and
            securities firms provide a range of prime-brokerage services to
            hedge funds, including securities lending, leveraged financing
            and introductions to investors. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Denies Singapore Stock Dump, Countersues</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit
            denied dumping a Singapore private wealth client's shares it
            held as collateral and said it's still owed money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quah Su Ling sued Goldman Sachs International in London,
            accusing it of breach of contract for selling her shares in
            Blumont Group Ltd., Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. and
            depressing their prices. Goldman Sachs International countersued
            for $12.3 million it says it's still owed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International sold the shares in an 'orderly
            and measured manner -- consistent with industry practice and
            accepted standards -- over the course of three weeks,' the bank
            said in court papers filed in London and made available this
            week. The lawsuit is Quah's 'attempt to delay or avoid
            repayment of debt.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the three Singapore companies tumbled with
            Asiasons falling 62 percent on Oct. 4, while Blumont declined 56
            percent and LionGold was down 42 percent. Over three days from
            Oct. 4, the declines erased $6.9 billion from Singapore's bourse
            value. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the city's stock
            exchange said they would probe activities around the shares of
            the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Quah, the Chief Executive Officer of IPCO International
            Ltd., claimed Goldman Sachs demanded she repay $48 million
            within 1 1/2 hours on Oct. 2 and started selling her shares. The
            bank hadn't informed her previously of any shortfall in her
            margin loan or give her reasonable time to make payment, Quah
            said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Quah didn't respond
            to two e-mails or a call to her office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also been sued in London by James Hong,
            an executive director at Blumont. Hong claimed the bank breached
            its duties by 'arbitrarily' selling his shares in the three
            Singapore commodity companies held as collateral, according to
            the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators around the world have stepped up oversight of
            capital markets after the global financial crisis in 2008.
            Singapore's central bank established a 13-member council in 2010
            with the goal of boosting corporate governance standards and
            investor confidence. The Singapore Exchange, Southeast Asia's
            biggest bourse, said after the decline of the three stocks it
            plans to add circuit breakers in 2014 to halt trading for 10
            minutes when shares move 10 percent in either direction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Quah Su Ling v Goldman Sachs International.

            of 4 percent to 5 percent over the next five years as the
            industry struggles amid low interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody hopes to get the five hedge funds, all of whom
            are going to have 15 percent returns,' Sharmin Mossavar- Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs
            Private
            Wealth Management's Investment Strategy Group, said at a press
            briefing today. 'People need to be more realistic.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $2.19 trillion hedge-fund industry last year trailed
            global stocks for the fifth time in seven years, posting a 6.7
            percent gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The MSCI
            All-Country World Index (MXWO) returned 17 percent in 2012, and the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) rose 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve officials said last year they will keep
            interest rates near zero as long as the jobless rate is above
            6.5 percent and inflation is forecast to be 2.5 percent or less.
            Previously they said they will keep rates low through at least
            mid-2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mossavar-Rahmani said investors are 'overestimating' how
            much hedge funds can return in excess of market indexes. While
            some managers may do well, the low-interest-rate environment
            makes it difficult to produce double-digit returns, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They don't walk on water,' Mossavar-Rahmani said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equity funds and event-driven funds, those that invest in
            companies undergoing transactions such as mergers or spinoffs,
            may benefit if stock markets rise next year, she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Tops Other Banks in Analyst Pay: Chart of the Day</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The base salaries of analysts at
            three major U.S. investment banks have declined since 2009,
            while increasing 15 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows that from 2009 to 2012, the base
            pay of analysts at Goldman Sachs increased to $76,250 on average
            from $66,000 according to data provided by Glassdoor, a San
            Francisco-based career website. The combined average pay at Bank
            of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Co. over
            the same period fell to $58,226 from $62,105. The data, which
            exclude bonuses and other forms of compensation, were gathered
            from verified surveys of analysts with one to three years of
            experience at each firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower salaries are 'consistent with what we're hearing, so
            it suggests to me that until there's a turnaround in the banking
            sector, until the next period of real growth, we may see more of
            the same,' said John Challenger, chief executive officer of
            Chicago-based Challenger Gray Christmas Inc., an employment
            consulting firm. 'Goldman has continued to go out and pay for
            and be the place that the very top talent wants to go. It's a
            conscious choice that they've made to not lose that position.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and
            Citigroup declined to comment on the Glassdoor survey. Morgan
            Stanley is planning to eliminate 1,600 jobs in the coming weeks
            according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. This
            accounts for 6 percent of the company's investment banking
            division. The nine largest investment banks announced more than
            30,000 job cuts in the first nine months of 2012 according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Tells Jury Dragon Rushed Toward Doomed Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) portrayed speech recognition pioneer Dragon Systems Inc. as rushing
            to close a $580 million deal without sufficiently vetting its buyer in a doomed union that triggered a
            negligence suit and landed the bank in Boston federal court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beginning its defense this
            week, Goldman Sachs made its case to jurors who have spent weeks hearing how the 2000 all- stock deal was
            quickly followed by an accounting scandal that led to the collapse of suitor Lernout Hauspie Speech Products
            NV. Goldman Sachs, which advised Dragon on the deal, called witnesses to counter allegations by Dragon
            founders Jim and Janet Baker that its negligence cost them their life's work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testifying
            Jan. 9 for Goldman Sachs, former Dragon president John Shagoury agreed with a bank attorney that Dragon's
            board of directors was focused on 'speed and certainty' in the months leading to the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Because
            the company's financial situation was getting worse instead of better, and at the same time we felt it was
            creating a huge distraction for the employees, we needed to get something done, or decide how the company
            was going to continue,' Shagoury testified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Do you blame Goldman Sachs that the stock
            options became worthless in the merger?' Goldman Sachs attorney Paul Vizcarrondo asked. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'No,'
            said Shagoury, who became president of Lernout Hauspie Holdings USA when the deal closed, and is now
            president of health care communications technology company Eliza Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Gross Negligence
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dragon's founders, who are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, claim
            that four Goldman Sachs bankers assigned to the transaction committed gross negligence by failing to pursue
            questions about Belgium-based Lernout Hauspie's finances that should have led them to avoid the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They alleged in court papers that they lost their company and access to the technology they had
            spent their careers developing, including Dragon NaturallySpeaking dictation software, when Lernout Hauspie
            filed for bankruptcy in November 2000. The deal closed in June of that year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs claimed its team gave Dragon competent advice and said it urged company management to press their
            accountants at Arthur Andersen LLP to probe Lernout Hauspie's finances. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Bakers, who
            started Dragon in 1982, claim the bankers failed to do due diligence and never advised them to back away
            from the sale despite lingering questions about LH's unusual revenue spikes in Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Due
            Diligence &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for New York-based Goldman Sachs have argued that due diligence
            wasn't the bank's responsibility under a five-page engagement agreement. Several members of the banking team
            who worked on the deal said in court testimony that Goldman Sachs properly shepherded the transaction to a
            final sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dragon paid Goldman Sachs $5 million for its advice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With
            the sale moving ahead in February 2000, Goldman Sachs sent Dragon an unsigned memo recommending the company
            have Arthur Anderson perform due diligence on Lernout Hauspie, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catherine
            Moy, who worked on the Dragon account for Arthur Anderson, testified Jan. 7 that her firm's work was 'very
            limited' on the deal. She said the accounting firm was never hired to do any of the tasks Goldman Sachs
            described in its Feb. 29 memo to Dragon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former Dragon President Shagoury testified that
            he remembered both Dragon's chief financial officer, Ellen Chamberlain, and Goldman Sachs's team wanted
            further due diligence. He said Chamberlain eventually declared it done. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recalls
            Completion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I recall she said the due diligence was completed,' Shagoury told jurors.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chamberlain, who testified Dec. 18, told the jury that Dragon expected Goldman Sachs to
            conduct due diligence. She said no one from the bank ever expressed reservations about moving forward with
            the sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I had a level of expectation of bankers driving a process, making due
            diligence happen, being very active, detailed and that was not the way Goldman Sachs operated,' she said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chamberlain also testified that no one on the Goldman team ever mentioned that the
            bank's own investment division had investigated LH in the late 1990s, under work labeled internally as
            'Project Sermon,' and decided not to invest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a videotaped deposition played for the
            jury Jan. 4, Goldman Sachs analyst Luca Velussi, who worked on Project Sermon, said he couldn't remember
            specific reasons why that project didn't move forward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Abandoned Projects &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We abandon the vast majority of projects,' Velussi said under questioning by the Bakers' attorney,
            Alan Cotler. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;T. Otey Smith, a former member of the Goldman Sachs team who worked on the
            Dragon deal, testified in a taped deposition that the team's leader, Richard Wayner, didn't press the issue
            that there were unanswered questions about the merger when Dragon's board of directors met and voted to
            approved it in March 2000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wayner testified last month that Goldman Sachs had unanswered
            questions about Lernout Hauspie's suspicious surges in sales in Asia -- revenue that turned out to be
            fictitious -- but never sought to stop Dragon from selling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wayner told the jury that,
            after informing Dragon that Goldman Sachs didn't receive satisfactory answers from LH, it was 'the client's
            decision whether or not they want to do the deal.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Inadequate Standards &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A former investment banker testifying on behalf of Dragon this week told jurors Goldman Sachs's
            team 'didn't provide the level of standards Goldman sets for itself,' nor did it meet industry standards.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Their failure to do that gave the folks at the March 27 meeting a flawed and inaccurate
            picture of what a merger with LH would actually look like,' said Donna Hitscherich, a former investment
            banker with JPMorgan Chase Co. who now lectures at Columbia Business School, referring to the board meeting.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said she spent more than 700 hours reviewing records from the case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I
            was shocked,' she said. 'It was grossly subpar and inadequate for the type of engagement they were assigned
            to.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said she would have expected Goldman Sachs to take additional action after
            sending Dragon the February 2000 memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In my mind, that's a showstopper,' Hitscherich
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next Week &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testimony in the case, presided over by U.S.
            District Judge Patti Saris, is scheduled to resume Jan. 14. Goldman Sachs Vice President Chris Fine, who was
            chief technology strategist for the bank's high-tech group during the Dragon sale, is to return to the
            witness stand. Goldman Sachs also said that it plans to call Wayner to testify again. Closing arguments are
            expected to begin at the end of next week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 9, Fine testified the Goldman Sachs
            team working on the deal developed a list of questions that needed answers in the months prior to the sale,
            and advised Dragon to obtain an accounting firm with knowledge of accounting regulations in Belgium. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Did Dragon follow up on the recommendation to do more due diligence?' a Goldman Sachs's lawyer
            asked Fine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Not that I recall,' he responded. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another case against
            New York-based Goldman Sachs filed by Paul G. Bamberg and Robert Roth, two other Dragon founders who held
            minority shares in the company, is being heard at the same time before Saris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lernout's
            Collapse &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lernout Hauspie
            created bogus customers, booked circular transactions with shell companies and recorded loans as sales from
            1996 to 2000. The company was forced to restate $373 million in earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The suit
            against Goldman Sachs was put on hold by agreement of both sides for years while the Bakers sued other
            participants and advisers in the deal. They've reached a total of about $70 million in settlements, their
            lawyer, Cotler, has told Saris. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the value of Dragon at the time of the sale,
            the Bakers' lost as much as $288.8 million in the deal and its aftermath, they said in court papers. Bamberg
            and Roth have said they lost as much as $50 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In court filings, Goldman Sachs
            said the plaintiffs' damages are less than the amount they've already recovered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan.
            2, Bamberg, now a senior lecturer on mathematics at Harvard University, testified he initially opposed the
            merger and was shocked when the deal became an all-stock offering. In one conversation with Dragon board
            members, he said he compared partnering with Lernout Hauspie to joining the Serbian Army. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bamberg
            said the Goldman Sachs team never raised any concerns about the deal at the board of directors meeting. He
            said he would have rejected the sale if they had. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Anything significant I would have
            said I'm not signing until we get more information about this,' Bamberg said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case
            is Baker v. Goldman Sachs Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman 10% Return Tied to CEO Pay Too Low for Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investors want a target for annual returns -- as long as it's higher
            than the one that pays a bonus to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and his top deputies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the New York-based firm set to report a fourth straight year of lower profitability than it
            had in the decade before the financial crisis, shareholders are waiting for Goldman Sachs to end its status
            as the only major investment bank that won't declare a public profitability target. The company's board of
            directors set a 10 percent return-on-equity target for top executives to earn their long-term bonuses, a
            level that even Blankfein has called 'hardly aspirational.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the lack of a target
            hasn't prevented Goldman Sachs's stock from almost doubling in the past two years, executives have been
            asked for a goal by analysts and investors during six of the last seven earnings calls and conference
            presentations. The most recent request came after third-quarter trading revenue dropped the most among the
            nine largest global investment banks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It does come up a lot with investors, how long do
            they have?' said Roger Freeman, a Barclays Plc (BARC) analyst in New York. 'It's a question of time --
            whether the environment for dealers gets better fast enough to avoid being in a difficult position of having
            to put a target out there that's meaningfully higher than where they're at.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees New Commodity Cycle as Shale Oil Spurs U.S. Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The commodities cycle that sent
            prices rising almost fourfold over 10 years is reversing and
            will eventually drive raw materials into a structural bear
            market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growth in shale oil output will keep U.S. energy prices
            low, reinforcing economic growth and leading to more tapering of
            government stimulus, the bank said in a report dated yesterday.
            That will cut raw-material demand in emerging markets and lead
            to weakened currencies that will encourage more production. The
            new cycle is the opposite of the 'super cycle' that ran from
            2002 through 2011, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I can't tell you about one commodity out there that has a
            bullish supply-side story,' Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
            research at Goldman, said at the company's investor conference
            in London today. 'A decade of higher commodity prices generated
            a supply response.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities posted the first annual drop in five years in
            2013 as supply exceeded demand for corn to sugar to nickel and
            investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value amid
            signs that economies are improving. As higher prices spurred
            miners and farmers to boost production at time when China's
            economic growth slowed, Citigroup Inc. said the 'super cycle'
            of gains has ended. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The rotation away from emerging markets and towards
            developed market demand as well as the supply increase,
            particularly the U.S. shale revolution, are creating a new
            commodity cycle,' Currie said in the report. 'On net, this new
            commodity cycle eventually suggests a structural bear market in
            commodities, but we believe that is still in the distant
            future.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Weakening Currencies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new cycle will lead emerging market nations to increase
            production to raise cash to make up for weakening currencies,
            which will further weaken prices and reinforce the U.S.
            recovery, Goldman said. A 'structural' bear market is only in
            the future because of transportation, processing and
            distribution bottlenecks, Goldman said. Surging U.S. oil output
            is largely trapped in the country and copper smelters are
            failing to process rising supplies from mines, according to the
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodity cycles last about 25 to 30 years, with the first
            half spent on building production capacity to meet demand and
            the next 10 to 15 years spent on building capacity to consume,
            Currie said. Returns in the last 10 to 15 years will be positive
            for industries such as petrochemicals, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Precious Metals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's Enhanced Commodity Index will fall 3
            percent in the next 12 months, with precious metals dropping 15
            percent on top of last year's 30 percent decline and agriculture
            falling 11 percent after sliding 18 percent in 2013, Goldman
            said. Industrial metals are forecast to decrease 5 percent and
            livestock 3 percent, according to the report. Energy will lose 1
            percent, after gaining 5.6 percent in 2013, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold prices will fall to $1,050 an ounce in 12 months from
            $1,246 an ounce now, while copper will be at $6,200 a metric ton
            from $7,283 a ton now as the market moves into surplus, the bank
            said. A record soybean crop in South America will send prices to
            $9.50 a bushel from $12.7325 a bushel now. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Brent will be at $100 a barrel in 12 months and West
            Texas Intermediate oil at $90 a barrel, price risk is 'skewed
            to the downside,' Currie said in the report. Uncertainty about
            oil supplies due to geopolitical risks in Libya and South Sudan
            means the bank is neutral commodities over the next three
            months, with prices forecast to return 3 percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Raw Sugar Falls in as Goldman Cuts Price Forecast; Cocoa Rises</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sugar fell in New York as Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut the sweetener's price forecast for the next
            three, six and 12 months on ample global supply. Cocoa rose. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw sugar traded on ICE Futures U.S. in New York will be at
            18.50 cents a pound in three and six months, down from a
            previous estimate of 22 cents, Damien Courvalin, an analyst at
            the bank in the city, said in a report dated yesterday. Sugar,
            which slid 16 percent last year, will be at 19 cents a pound in
            12 months, according to the bank's forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Going forward, we expect the global sugar market to
            remain in a surplus for the third consecutive year in 2013-14,'
            said Courvalin. 'We expect a further build in global
            inventories.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw sugar for March delivery retreated 0.6 percent to 19.06
            cents a pound by 6:04 a.m. in New York. The price gained as much
            as 1.2 percent in the previous trading session on Jan. 11.
            White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid 0.4 percent to
            $512.90 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sugarcane in Brazil's center south, the main growing region
            of the world's biggest producer, will keep expanding as farmers
            continue to plant and because of 'favorable' weather,
            according to Goldman Sachs. The crop will climb to as much as
            590 million metric tons in 2013-14 from 535.7 million tons in
            2012-13, Datagro Ltd. forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This larger harvest will most likely allow for both an
            increase in sugar and ethanol production,' Courvalin said. Both
            ethanol and sugar are made from sugar cane in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cocoa for March delivery gained 0.2 percent to $2,260 a ton
            on ICE. Cocoa for March delivery was up 0.4 percent to 1,444
            pounds ($2,326) a ton on NYSE Liffe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cocoa Consumption &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global cocoa consumption will exceed output by about
            100,000 tons in the season that started in October after two
            years of oversupply, according to Goldman Sachs. Output was
            90,000 tons higher than demand in the 2011-12 season after a
            record surplus of 341,000 tons a year earlier, according to the
            International Cocoa Organization in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee for March delivery rose 0.7 percent to
            $1.5435 a pound in New York. Robusta for March delivery advanced
            0.9 percent to $1,962 a ton in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see limited further downside to prices and expect
            coffee prices to remain rangebound near-term before recovering
            modestly in 2013,' Courvalin said, commenting on arabica beans. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BlackRock Hires Ex-Goldman Executive for China Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's largest
            asset manager, hired Hsueh-ming Wang, a former Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) executive, to head its China operations as it seeks
            to expand in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wang, who had been an advisory director at Goldman Sachs
            and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management in China, will be
            chairman of BlackRock China, responsible for developing and
            executing the firm's business strategy there, Bobbie Collins, a
            spokeswoman for the New York-based firm, said today in an e-
            mail. Wang will report to Mark McCombe, chairman of BlackRock's
            Asia-Pacific operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Laurence D. Fink, chairman and chief executive officer of
            BlackRock, said during a conference call with analysts and
            investors in 2011 that the firm is interested in expanding in
            Asia and investor deposits there are 'slower than we would
            like.' Fink hired McCombe in 2011 and last year hired Philipp
            Hildebrand, the former head of the Swiss central bank, to help
            expand relationships with institutional clients overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wang left Goldman in 2011, Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
            the firm in Hong Kong, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported Wang's appointment earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Opposes ACA Bid to Add Paulson to CDO Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accused ACA
            Financial Guaranty Corp. (MANF) of withholding thousands of audio
            recordings the investment bank wants in its fight against a
            lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs asked a New York state judge in court papers
            Jan. 11 to order bond insurer ACA to produce the recordings,
            pointing to one phone call that it says 'utterly eviscerates'
            ACA's claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'ACA's unjustified withholding of the additional
            recordings impedes Goldman Sachs' ability to challenge, and the
            court's ability to examine,' the claims in the case, the New
            York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's bid for the recordings comes after ACA
            sought court permission to file a revised complaint that adds
            hedge fund Paulson Co. as a defendant. ACA claims Goldman
            Sachs and Paulson conspired to induce it to provide financial
            guaranty insurance for Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA claims it was deceived into believing that Paulson was
            a long investor in the deal when the hedge fund was in fact
            betting against it. Goldman Sachs agreed to a $550 million
            settlement in 2010 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission to resolve claims that it misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Doomsday' Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its filing, Goldman Sachs quotes from a May 2007 call
            between an ACA portfolio manager and a bond trader at Morgan
            Stanley in which ACA is told Paulson was pursuing a 'doomsday'
            strategy and betting against the mortgage market. The recording
            'demonstrates unequivocally' that ACA actually knew of
            Paulson's shorting strategy, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for New York-based ACA, said in
            an interview that the call wasn't about Abacus and was instead
            'anecdotal market chatter' about Paulson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA, which is seeking to recover $120 million in damages,
            cites in its complaint a recording in which a Goldman Sachs
            managing director told ACA that Paulson was a '100 percent
            equity' investor in the deal. ACA has produced 6,900 recordings
            to Goldman Sachs and will turn over more as they become
            available, Kasowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs's specific misrepresentation to ACA about
            Paulson's '100 percent equity' interest in Abacus trumps any
            anecdotal market 'color' by a third party,' Kasowitz said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. v. Goldman Sachs
            Co., 650027-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Is Said to Refrain From Delaying U.K. Bonus Payouts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won't delay
            distribution of U.K. bonuses to help minimize employees' tax
            rates, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm had considered postponing incentive compensation
            due to employees from 2009, 2010 and 2011 until after top
            income-tax rates drop in April. Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said today it's 'depressing' that banks
            may be willing to
            shift bonus payments to minimize workers' tax burden. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Treasury minister Sajid Javid spoke with Goldman Sachs
            representatives today, according to a person with knowledge of
            the discussion. They gave assurances that bonuses would be paid
            in the normal way and that there would be no changes to the
            schedule. The call was set up yesterday, said the person, who
            requested anonymity because the discussion was private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs accelerated delivery of $65 million in stock
            awards last month to 10 executives, including Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, in a move that helped them avoid
            higher U.S. taxes that take effect this year. That change, which
            didn't affect compensation for 2012, was made public in company
            filings at about 8 p.m. New York time on Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This week, the Financial Times and other media reported
            that New York-based Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank
            by assets, was reviewing whether to delay U.K. bonus payments
            due from prior years to help employees pay lower rates. The
            reports were met with criticism from U.K. politicians and King. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Management opted against proceeding with the plan, a
            decision that was ratified today in a regular meeting of the
            board's compensation committee, said the person with knowledge
            of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;British Broadcasting Corp. editor Robert Peston reported
            Goldman Sachs's decision earlier today on Twitter.com. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hochtief Soars on Goldman 'Conviction Buy' Seal: Frankfurt Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hochtief AG (HOT), the German builder
            controlled by Spain's Actividades de Construccion y Servicios
            SA, jumped to the highest level since March after Goldman Sachs
            Group added the company to its 'conviction buy' list. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares climbed as much as 4.4 percent to 47.49 euros in
            Frankfurt trading, and traded 4.3 percent higher as of 11:04
            a.m. That extends the gains this month to 7.9 percent and values
            the company at 3.6 billion euros ($4.8 billion). The 148,235
            shares traded after two hours represent 93 percent of the three-
            month average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hochtief, whose historic projects include Frankfurt's
            Commerzbank Tower, once Europe's tallest building, is benefiting
            from an industry upturn that has resulted in a 12 percent gain
            in the Stoxx 600 Construction and Materials Index over the past
            year. Marcelino Fernandez Verdes, the former head of ACS's
            construction business who became Hochtief's chief executive in
            November, is scheduled to present a plan to increase
            profitability and reduce participation in high-risk projects on
            Feb. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Hochtief has rallied since the new CEO was announced in
            November, but with the rest of the sector up, we believe
            Hochtief can go further,' Goldman said in a research note
            today. 'While execution will likely take time, we believe
            clearer goals could increase investor interest.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Profitability at the Essen-based company may be boosted by
            anticipated process improvements in the coming years, Goldman
            said. The investment bank previously rated Hochtief stock at
            neutral. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Joins Japan Stock Bulls as Abe Advance Seen</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
            America Corp. and Nomura (8604) Holdings Inc. are predicting Japanese
            stocks will extend their longest streak of gains in 23 years as
            extra economic stimulus boost earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Topix Index, Japan's broadest gauge of share
            performance, rose for nine straight weeks through Jan. 11, the
            longest stretch since December 1989 (TPX), when it hit a record
            2,886.5. Goldman Sachs boosted its estimate to 1,000 on Jan. 7
            from 930, while Bank of America increased its 12-month estimate
            to 1,250 from 1,050, according to a Jan. 11 note from Tokyo-
            based chief equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. That's a gain of
            39 percent from the last close of 898.69. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced 10.3 trillion yen ($116
            billion) in additional stimulus measures on Jan. 11 and is
            pressuring the Bank of Japan to double its inflation target to 2
            percent after the third recession in five years. Goldman Sachs
            is buying shares of exporters, financial firms and utilities,
            Hiroyuki Ito, Tokyo-based head of equity investment at Goldman
            Sachs Asset Management Co., said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Abe is not just talk, but is about action,' Jesper Koll,
            head of equity research at JPMorgan Chase Co. in Tokyo, said
            Jan. 11. 'In his first 30 days, it's really quite impressive in
            that you have a concrete supplementary spending.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Koll has a 12-month target of 1,050 for the Topix. Analysts
            surveyed in December said the Topix would rise to 905 by year-
            end, according to the median of 14 estimates. Predictions have
            been revised up after Abe's Liberal Democratic Party was
            returned to power at Dec. 16 elections. The Topix increased 0.8
            percent to 906.22 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All 33 industries on the Topix advanced since Nov. 14.
            Securities companies led, as Nomura, the country's biggest
            brokerage, jumped 72 percent and Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)
            surged 49 percent as the market rallied. Gauges of shipping
            companies and iron and steel manufacturers recorded the second-
            and third-biggest increases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A weaker yen and Abe's stimulus policies will boost
            earnings, according to a Jan. 7 note from Goldman Sachs analysts
            led by chief Japan strategist Kathy Matsui. The yen fell below
            89 to the U.S. dollar last week and is trading at its lowest
            level since June 2010. The currency has declined 11 percent
            since the election was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nikkei 225 Stock Average will advance 9.7 percent to
            11,860 by year end, Jefferies Group Inc. analysts led by Sean
            Darby, chief global equity strategist said Jan. 10, citing
            improving trade ties with China as a catalyst for earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Earnings are forecast to rise more than 20 percent in
            fiscal 2013 and Japanese stocks remain relatively cheap,' said
            Masahiro Fukuda, investment director at Fidelity Worldwide
            Investment in Tokyo. 'Even before talk on Abe-nomics began,
            Japanese stocks could've rebounded to this level without
            counting the impact of a rapid drop in the yen on earnings.
            Valuation justifies further gains when you take a weaker yen
            into account.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1983 Levels &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Income per share on the Topix Index will climb 56 percent
            in the next year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
            That compares with a 13 percent increase for the Standard
            Poor's 500 Index and 27 percent for the Shanghai Composite
            Index, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Topix trades for 1.06 times book value, up from 0.82
            times the value of net assets in June, the lowest ever,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1993. The
            gauge closed at 695.51 on June 4, a level not seen since 1983. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nakayama Steel Works Ltd. (5408), which gets all its revenue from
            Japan, almost doubled in value during the nine-week rally,
            surging 97 percent and leading gains by makers of the material
            on speculation Abe will pursue greater public-works spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Export Prospects &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101), Japan's biggest shipping line by market
            value, added 42 percent as the yen's decline and signs of
            recovery in the economies of China and the U.S. boosted the
            propects for exports. Progress in halting the spread of Europe's
            debt crisis also improved the outlook for the company, which
            receives 39 percent of revenue from routes to the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I'rom Holdings Co. (2372), a supplier of equipment and management
            services to medical institutions, gained the most among the
            Topix's 1,687 members, surging 224 percent from Nov. 14. Kubotek
            Corp., a maker of inspection systems for display manufacturers
            including South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co., recorded the
            second-biggest advance, jumping 178 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time analysts have called for a rally
            in Japanese shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A surge from November 2010 through the start of 2011 was
            cut short by the March 11 earthquake. Forecasts for a recovery
            in share prices on the back of reconstruction spending were
            dashed as the government of former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda
            proved unable to restart the economy. The yen rose as Europe's
            sovereign-debt crisis and an uneven recovery in the U.S
            conspired sent investors in search of safer assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growth Challenge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Expectations for policy action will lead the market, but
            I'm not sure how much impact it will actually have on
            earnings,' said said Shintaro Shinohara, who helps oversee
            about 11 trillion yen ($124 billion) as the head of equity
            investment at Prudential Investment Management Japan Co. 'It's
            not going to be a one-way rally. Globally, Europe's growth will
            be about 1 percent, the U.S. faces uncertainty and China's not
            going to expand as fast as previously.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan faces domestic problems as well. More than 25 percent
            of people are older than 65 and the country's government debt
            has balooned to 185 percent of gross domestic product. The
            country's shares trade about 70 percent below their 1989 level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of the stimulus package announced Jan. 11, about 3.8
            trillion yen will be for disaster prevention and reconstruction,
            with 3.1 trillion yen directed to stimulating private investment
            and other measures, according to a statement released by the
            Cabinet Office. Extra spending will increase gross domestic
            product by about 2 percentage points and create about 600,000
            jobs, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Game Changer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's currency slid below 120 per euro yesterday for the
            first time since May 2011 after Abe said he wanted someone 'who
            can push through bold monetary policy' as the next Bank of
            Japan (8301) governor. The BOJ meets next week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This year may become a game-changing year for Japanese
            stocks,' said Takashi Ito, an equity strategist at Nomura in
            Tokyo. 'The new government are aiming to support corporate
            growth and let Japanese companies lead the Japanese economy.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sparks CTC Jump as Shows to Lift Sales</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) is rebounding from
            the cheapest level versus peers since 2009 as Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. recommends buying the Russian television company on
            prospects a focus on younger viewers will stoke revenue growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of CTC traded in the Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP) jumped
            7.3 percent yesterday to $8.70 in New York, the biggest advance
            since Aug. 7. The Moscow-based company traded for 9.3 times
            estimated earnings, the highest valuation since Dec. 13. CTC's
            rally, the steepest on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
            yesterday, narrowed its discount to companies on the MSCI
            Emerging Markets Media Index (MXEF0MD) to 61 percent, from as wide as 67
            percent Dec. 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CTC's revenue will climb 10 percent next year and about 11
            percent in 2014 and 2015 as it wins more viewers with original
            programming and as the company cuts costs, Goldman analysts led
            by Alexander Balakhnin, wrote in a report dated Jan. 11. CTC,
            which tumbled 11 percent last year as it took on a new chief
            executive officer, is debuting new shows including 'Angel and
            Demon' and 'The Eighties' as it seeks out viewers aged 10 to 45. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The stock is undervalued, it's a clear buy for those who
            want exposure to Russia's growth story,' Konstantin Chernyshev,
            the Moscow-based head of research at UralSib Financial Corp.,
            which has had a buy rating on CTC since May 2011, said by phone
            yesterday. 'CTC Media has a lot of potential for growth as the
            company has a good management team, has stabilized its share of
            viewers and is winning new ones.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Increased Volume &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN) rose 1.1 percent to
            101.38 yesterday and RTS stock futures expiring in March held at
            159,090 in the New York day. Trading volume in CTC Media's stock
            was almost four times the average daily volume for the past
            three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the largest dedicated
            Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 1.3 percent to $30.14
            yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
            swings in the stock futures, decreased 0.3 percent to 20.58. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under CEO Boris Podolsky, who moved from the chief
            financial officer position on June 14, CTC will post an 11
            percent jump in 2013 revenue, after an predicted 2.8 percent
            increase in 2012, according to the mean of 12 analysts'
            estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company's 2013 revenue will
            rise to $872.7 million, according to forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian television advertising will probably rise between
            10 percent and 15 percent in 2013 from 2012, fueled by an
            expanding economy, UralSib's Chernyshev said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ad Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's gross domestic product will climb 3.4 percent in
            2013, according to the median of 25 economists's estimates in a
            Bloomberg survey last month. Economic growth probably
            accelerated 3.5 percent in 2012, the government forecast last
            year, slowing from 4.3 percent expansion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Total spending on Russian TV ads is expected to increase to
            $5.9 billion in 2014, the biggest market in Europe, from $4.4
            billion in 2011, CTC Media says on its website, citing estimates
            by industry think-tanks, including Zenith Optimedia and Video
            International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CTC, which operates television channels in Russia,
            Kazakhstan, Moldova and broadcasts its programs in countries
            including Germany, the U.S., Thailand and Israel, is switching
            its focus to a younger audience beginning this year as it seeks
            to attract more advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The broadcaster will direct its content to viewers aged 10
            to 45 years-old, compared with the previous target of six to 54-
            year-olds, CEO Podolsky told analysts on a conference call Aug.
            7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Local Shows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from advertising accounted for more than 97
            percent of company revenue in 2011, the highest level since
            2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CTC TV, the company's main television channel, has changed
            its strategy and is winning more viewership by broadcasting
            domestically made shows, rather than Hollywood-made
            blockbusters, Goldman's Balakhnin wrote, adding that the new
            strategy also helps to cut costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The largest non-government television broadcaster in
            Russia, CTC said its audience of viewers aged six to 54 for all
            of its television channels increased to 14.8 percent in the
            third quarter, from 14.7 percent a year ago, and was the third-
            biggest after NTV Television and TNT TV. The company cited TNS
            Global as a source for the data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CTC TV's weekly audience of viewers aged 18 years and older
            rose to 6.9 percent in the week to Jan. 6, from 5.3 percent in
            the week to Dec. 30, TNS Global data showed Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;VimpelCom Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The launch of the spring season, with new episodes of
            existing titles and scheduled premieres, should support audience
            share dynamics and unwind inventory erosion concerns,'
            Goldman's Balakhnin wrote. 'The quality of programming has
            improved and the company is able to retain audience share
            through more cost-efficient means.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP), Russia's third-biggest mobile phone company
            by subscribers, rallied 1.5 percent to $10.75 yesterday in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Markus Bjerke, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo,
            raised its recommendation on the shares to buy from hold and
            lifted the price estimate on the shares to $13 from $10.60. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crude for February delivery gained 0.6 percent to $94.14 a
            barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the
            highest level since Sept. 18. It slid 0.5 percent to $93.68 by
            8:25 a.m. today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent oil for February settlement increased 1.1 percent to
            $111.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
            yesterday, before dropping 0.3 percent today to $111.58. Urals
            crude, Russia's chief export blend, rose 1.1 percent to $109.96,
            and was down 0.1 percent today to $109.83 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble added 0.2 percent to 30.2540 per dollar
            yesterday, the highest level since May 11. It was little changed
            at 30.275 today. Ruble futures showed the currency strengthening
            0.2 percent to 30.520 per dollar in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;United Co. Rusal (486), the world's largest aluminum producer,
            dropped 0.8 percent to HK$5.01 in Hong Kong today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Treasuries Gain in '14 as Gundlach to Goldman See Rates on Hold</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Treasuries are having their best
            start to a year since 2010 as investors from Jeffrey Gundlach to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say the Federal Reserve will keep its
            benchmark interest rate at almost zero into 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. government securities have returned 0.7 percent in
            2014 through yesterday, the most for the first two weeks in four
            years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
            Treasuries fell after a report showed a New York manufacturing
            index increased this month more than forecast. Fed officials
            Charles Evans and Dennis Lockhart are scheduled to speak. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors who late last year anticipated stronger U.S.
            data were forced to buy Treasuries this year to cover short
            positions as growth appears to be losing momentum,' said Nick Stamenkovic, a fixed-income strategist at
            broker RIA Capital
            Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh, referring to bets that an asset price
            will fall. 'While we expect the Fed to continue with its
            tapering program, it's unlikely that interest rates will rise
            any time soon.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year note yield rose one basis point, or
            0.01 percentage point, to 2.88 percent at 8:33 a.m. New York
            time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
            2.75 percent security due November 2023 was 98 28/32. The yield
            will be 3.43 percent by year-end, according to the weighted
            average estimate of more than 60 forecasters surveyed by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Jobs Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasuries surged on Jan. 10 after a government report
            showed the world's biggest economy added 74,000 jobs in
            December, versus the gain of 197,000 projected by a Bloomberg
            News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. government securities are rallying after debt due in
            10 years and longer tumbled 13 percent 2013, the biggest loss
            among 144 sovereign bond indexes globally compiled by Bloomberg
            and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gundlach, whose DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (DBLTX) beat 81
            percent of its competitors in the past year with a 0.5 percent
            gain, said short-term interest rates will stay low into 2016.
            Gundlach, who is based in Los Angeles, said he's not so sure
            that Treasury yields are headed higher, speaking yesterday in a
            webcast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said
            yesterday there probably won't be an interest-rate increase
            until early 2016. The Fed will probably conclude its bond-purchase program in late 2014, he said at an event
            in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Strategic Income Fund (GSZAX) gained 4.4 percent
            over the past year, beating 92 percent of its peers, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund is run by Jonathan
            Beinner and Michael Swell in New York, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fed Speakers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, who was among officials who voted in favor of
            reducing stimulus at the Fed's Dec. 18 meeting, said last month
            he wanted to see more signs that inflation would accelerate and
            job-market gains would continue before changing policy. Lockhart
            said two days ago that weak payroll growth last month should not
            discourage policy makers from reducing monthly bond purchases as
            long as the economy continues to strengthen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee last month said it will
            continue to keep interest rates exceptionally low 'well past'
            a decline in the jobless rate below 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed has kept its target for overnight loans between
            banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent for five years. The
            chance of an increase by January 2015 are about 23 percent,
            according to futures contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's rally in Treasuries was interrupted yesterday
            when Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said the economy
            was on 'firmer footing' and the central bank's decision to cut
            debt purchases was a step in the right direction. Plosser votes
            on monetary policy this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Taper Vote &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers in December announced plans to cut their
            monthly bond purchases to $75 billion a month from $85 billion
            starting in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reports today will show manufacturing in the New York
            region climbed to a four-month high in January, while producer
            prices increased in December, based on surveys of economists by
            Bloomberg News. The Fed is scheduled to publish its Beige Book
            business survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The World Bank raised its global growth forecasts, saying
            the easing of austerity policies in advanced economies supports
            their recovery, improving the outlook for exports from
            developing nations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Washington-based lender sees the world economy
            expanding 3.2 percent this year, compared with a June projection
            of 3 percent. U.S. growth will be 2.8 percent, the bank said in
            its Global Economic Prospects report published twice a year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Morgan Stanley Set $557 Million Fed Mortgage Accord</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) agreed to offer a $557 million package of
            cash and other assistance for mortgage borrowers to settle a federal probe into allegations that the banks
            improperly seized homes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sum includes $232 million in direct payments to more than
            220,000 borrowers and $325 million in assistance such as loan modifications, the Federal Reserve said in a
            statement. Eric Kollig, a Fed spokesman, declined to say how much each of the New York-based firms will pay.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal adds to the $8.5 billion settlement announced last week among the Fed, the
            Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 10 of the biggest U.S. lenders, including JPMorgan Chase Co.
            (JPM), Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. Regulators probed allegations that lenders rushed home
            foreclosures by using flawed documents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'With the addition of Goldman Sachs and Morgan
            Stanley, more than 4 million borrowers will receive a total of $3.5 billion in cash compensation while an
            additional $5.5 billion will be provided by the servicers for mortgage assistance,' the Fed said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's share of the accord totals $227 million, consisting of $97
            million in cash and $130 million in other relief, according to two people briefed on the matter. Goldman
            Sachs will pay $135 million in cash plus $195 million in relief, said the people, who asked for anonymity
            because terms weren't publicly announced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Helping Borrowers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cash
            payments in today's deal range as high as $125,000 and cover borrowers whose homes were in foreclosure in
            2009 and 2010, the Fed said. The loans were handled by Litton Loan Servicing LP, which formerly was owned by
            Goldman Sachs, and Saxon Mortgage Services Inc., which was a unit of Morgan Stanley, according to the Fed.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Lake of Morgan Stanley both
            said their firms were pleased to have resolved the probe. Lake declined to say whether the accord will
            result in a charge against fourth-quarter earnings, which are scheduled to be released Jan. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set aside $260 million in the fourth quarter to cover litigation and regulatory
            proceedings including today's settlement, according to a statement today released with the firm's earnings.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Longer List &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs bought Litton in 2007 to get into
            mortgage servicing, and Morgan Stanley bought Saxon in 2006, before a housing market collapse that led to
            the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Litton started 135,586 foreclosures in 2009 and 2010,
            and Saxon initiated at least 60,313 actions in the same period, according to the Fed. Both banks later sold
            the servicers to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The settlement with Goldman Sachs and
            Morgan Stanley expands the industry payouts beyond the initial 14 firms that agreed in 2011 to hire outside
            consultants to review their foreclosures for errors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Inc. (HBC) and Ally
            Financial Inc. (ALLY) are also preparing to sign on to the deal, two people briefed on the matter have said.
            Neil Brazil, a U.S. spokesman for HSBC, said the bank is still in discussions with regulators. Its mortgage-
            servicing operations were regulated by both the Fed and OCC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The OCC continues
            conversations with the remaining servicers,' said Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IndyMac
            Bancorp's successor OneWest Bank FSB and EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER) also haven't reached an accord with
            regulators. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ally, with all its mortgage-servicing affiliates, represented the
            fifth-largest U.S. servicer with 2.5 million loans during the crisis, according to the Fed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Residential
            Capital LLC, the unit of Detroit-based Ally involved in the settlement, supports the idea that bank funds
            'should go toward consumers rather than consultants,' and has been delayed in considering the settlement
            because of its bankruptcy, said Susan Fitzpatrick, a bank spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Boosts Iron Ore View as 'Oversupply' Two Years Away</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore will see another year of
            'exceptional prices' before supplies start to outpace demand,
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today as it increased its forecast
            for the seaborne commodity used in steel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices will probably average $144 a dry ton in 2013, up
            from $140 estimated previously, the bank said in an e-mailed
            report. The ore may decline to $126 in 2014 before averaging $90
            in 2015 and $80 in 2016, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore surged 76 percent since dropping to a three-year
            low in September on optimism China, the biggest buyer, is
            recovering. JPMorgan Chase Co. today increased its 2013
            estimate to an average $130 from $110, while Deutsche Bank AG
            said Jan. 8 prices may climb to $170 in the first half before
            falling below $120. Rio Tinto Group, the second-biggest
            exporter, posted yesterday better-than-expected output for the
            fourth quarter and said it will press ahead with expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'market is headed for a long period of significant
            oversupply, but in our view this is still two years away,' said
            Goldman. 'We expect iron ore producers will see one last year
            of exceptional prices and profit margins' as the 'restocking
            phase continues, supply starts to tighten and market sentiment
            becomes more bullish,' the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
            port of Tianjin declined a fourth day, dropping 1.1 percent to
            $152.90 yesterday, according to data from The Steel Index Ltd.
            Prices climbed to $158.50 on Jan. 8, the most expensive since
            Oct. 13, 2011 after rallying 39 percent in the three months
            through December, the most since at least 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Unwilling Buyers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rally prompted Chinese steelmakers to use more domestic
            supplies, a survey by Mysteel.com showed. Higher prices will
            stop mills from rebuilding inventories, according to Hebei Iron
            Steel Group and Maanshan Iron Steel (323) Co. The country's
            steelmakers are unwilling to buy imported ore at above $150, UBS
            AG analyst Hubert Tang said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices will drop from an average $145 in the first quarter
            this year to $120 in the fourth quarter as new supply comes on
            stream, Fraser Jamieson, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a
            report. The bounce in prices from September while China's
            production was stable suggests restocking, 'which we estimate
            will come to an end around Chinese new year in early February
            when activity typically slows,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Imports last month climbed to a record 70.94 million tons
            from 65.78 million tons in November, customs data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Strong demand growth in China has induced the development
            of low-grade, high-cost operations that require relatively high
            prices in order to remain viable,' said Goldman. 'As long as
            those mines remain in operation, we believe the seaborne price
            will be supported at a high level.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The growth in the China's steel output will accelerate to
            4.9 percent in 2013, while inventory levels in the country's
            ports of 73 million tons are at their lowest since January 2011,
            said Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Cobalt Falls After Goldman, Riverstone Cut Their Stakes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Cobalt International Energy Inc (CIE),
            the explorer seeking oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West
            Africa, fell the most in more than a month after Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) and other backers announced plans to sell 40 million
            shares worth more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cobalt fell 7.1 percent to $24.84 at the close in New York,
            the biggest decline since Dec. 12. The share sale would reduce
            the holdings of Goldman Sachs and First Reserve Corp. as well as
            funds owned by Carlyle Group LP (CG) and Riverstone Holdings LLC from
            about 15 percent each to less than 13 percent, according to a
            filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A successful sale would drop holdings by Cobalt's biggest
            investors below 50 percent, requiring the company to qualify a
            majority of directors as independent within a year to meet New
            York Stock Exchange standards, according to the filing. Cobalt
            won't receive any proceeds from the share sale. The shares have
            climbed to as much as $34.03 since first offered to the public
            at $13.50 in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cobalt, based in Houston, announced Dec. 5 a
            'significant' discovery at its North Platte prospect in the
            Gulf of Mexico. The company announced its second discovery off
            the coast of Angola July 31. It has yet to report a profit as a
            public company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman intends to sell 13 million shares, paring its stake
            to 12.15 percent from 15.33 percent, according to the filing.
            Funds controlled by Carlyle and Riverstone will also offer 13
            million shares, trimming their holdings to 12.15 percent. Funds
            of First Reserve expect to sell 10 million shares to retain a
            12.76 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KERN Fund, with investors that include Stanford University
            and Caisse de depot et placement due Quebec, plans to sell 3.9
            million shares, trimming its stake to 5.61 percent from 6.56
            percent, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Exploration Success &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cobalt's $1.38 billion of 2.625 percent convertible notes,
            which mature in December 2019 and can be swapped for shares at
            about $35.69 each, dropped 3.4 cents to 103.5 cents on the
            dollar and yielded 2.1 percent at 9:52 a.m. in New York,
            according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have had successes in our exploration efforts in each
            of our focus areas,' Cobalt said in the prospectus filed today
            with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Cobalt has
            'long-lived leasehold positions that cannot be replicated,'
            according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) will handle the sale with
            an option to buy as many as 6 million additional shares at the
            offer price, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Profit Beats Analysts' Estimates on Investments</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) climbed the most in 10 months after quarterly profit beat estimates
            and full-year revenue grew for the first time since 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock rose 4.1 percent to
            $141.09 at 4:09 p.m. in New York, the biggest gain since March 13, pushing the year-to-date increase to 11
            percent. The firm said fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $5.60 a share, surpassing even the
            highest estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
            Blankfein, 58, who has undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-2011, cut 900 jobs
            during the year and slashed the portion of revenue allocated to pay. A stock-market rebound and a $500
            million profit from selling a hedge fund-administration unit helped revenue recover from the lowest first
            half since 2005. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is a very cyclical business, highly dependent on capital
            markets,' said Michael Vogelzang, chief investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4
            billion, including Goldman Sachs stock. 'The capital markets were doing well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Return on
            average common stockholders' equity, a measure of how well the firm reinvests shareholder money, rose to
            10.7 percent in 2012 from 3.7 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s compensation expense climbed 6 percent in 2012, the first increase
            in three years, as revenue rose 19 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expense, which includes salaries,
            bonuses, benefits and deferred awards from previous years, advanced to $12.9 billion for the year from $12.2
            billion in 2011, the New York-based company said today in a statement. The cost amounted to 38 percent of
            revenue, compared with 42 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, has sought to lower annual costs by $1.9 billion since mid-2011 as the
            fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets contended with slumping revenue. The pay increase for 2012 contrasts with
            a 3 percent decline in the number of employees to 32,400 during the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pay
            expense averages $399,506 per employee, up from $367,057 in 2011. The average compensation figures are

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won't delay
            distribution of U.K. bonuses to help minimize employees' tax
            rates, a person with direct knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm had considered postponing incentive compensation
            due to employees from 2009, 2010 and 2011 until after top
            income-tax rates drop in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In remarks to lawmakers in London yesterday, Bank of
            England Governor Mervyn King criticized the plan as 'lacking in
            care and attention to how others might react.' He said it's
            'depressing' that banks may be willing to shift bonus payments
            to minimize workers' tax burden. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs accelerated delivery of $65 million in stock
            awards last month to 10 executives, including Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, in a move that helped them avoid
            higher U.S. taxes that take effect this year. That change, which
            didn't affect compensation for 2012, was made public by company
            filings at about 8 p.m. New York time on New Year's Eve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This week, the Financial Times and other media reported
            that Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
            reviewing whether to delay U.K. bonus payments due from prior
            years to help employees pay lower rates. The reports were met
            with criticism from U.K. politicians as well as King. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Management decided against proceeding with the plan, a
            decision that was ratified yesterday in a regular meeting of the
            board's compensation committee, according to the person, who
            asked to not be identified because deliberations were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision by New York-based Goldman Sachs was reported
            earlier yesterday by British Broadcasting Corp. editor Robert
            Peston on Twitter.com. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Appraisal Standards for Higher-Risk Mortgages Approved by FDIC &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. mortgage lenders will get an additional year to
            implement new appraisal standards for higher-risk loans after
            regulators revised the Dodd-Frank Act measure to address
            concerns raised by financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Creditors issuing loans at above-average interest rates
            that don't meet the 'qualified mortgage' standard will need to
            get written reports by certified appraisers who physically
            inspect homes under rules approved yesterday by the Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corp., one of six regulators that must sign
            off. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders will get the full 12-month implementation period
            permitted under the statute, according to John Fairbanks, a
            spokesman for the National Credit Union Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to the initial physical inspection, the rule
            requires a second appraisal when a home is being turned around
            for a quick, higher resale. Fairbanks said the final rule
            doesn't require the second appraisal if the new sale price is
            only slightly higher. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The six U.S. regulators involved in the joint rule include
            the FDIC, NCUA, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller
            of the Currency, Federal Housing Finance Agency and Consumer
            Financial Protection Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BBA Proposes Independent Board to Monitor Banking Standards &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The British Bankers' Association, a financial lobby group,
            proposed creating an independent council to promote a new code
            of conduct for bankers after scandals eroded trust in the
            industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The code would guide banks on pay, what's expected of
            boards and controls to prevent unethical behavior, the London-
            based BBA said in a submission to parliament published
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plan comes after banks set aside about 11 billion
            pounds ($17.7 billion) to compensate customers mis-sold loan
            insurance and for the Libor scandal. Royal Bank of Scotland
            Group Plc, Britain's biggest government-owned lender, may pay as
            much as 500 million pounds in fines next week to settle
            allegations traders tried to rig interest rates, two people with
            knowledge of the matter said. Barclays Plc (BARC) was fined 290 million
            pounds in June for manipulating Libor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed Banking Standards Review Council 'would need
            to be independent of the industry' with a non-banking chairman
            and a majority of non-banking members, including customers, the
            lobby group said in its submission to the Parliamentary
            Commission on Banking Standards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.K.'s Biggest Companies Lower Tax Rate With Overseas Business &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.K. companies paid taxes at a lower rate for
            the fourth consecutive year, partly by garnering more profit
            overseas, and caused public outcry by avoiding levies in
            Britain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The effective tax rate for FTSE 100 companies, the largest
            traded on the London Stock Exchange, fell to 24.5 percent from
            35.8 percent in 2009, according to UHY Hacker Young, a London-
            based accounting company. The firm said in an e-mailed statement
            that reductions in corporate taxes around the world, including
            in the U.K., have helped multinational companies reduce their
            tax payments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable said in December that
            governments should coordinate across borders to make companies
            pay more tax. More than 20 companies left the U.K. for tax
            reasons from 2007 to 2011, according to the accounting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government will be encouraged by tax-law changes that
            prompted a few to return, the firm said. An 'anti-abuse' rule
            that may be considered by the U.K. government to limit tax
            avoidance could drive more companies away, the accountants said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The averages used in the study are taken from effective tax
            rates reported by FTSE 100 companies in their latest annual
            reports or by their investor relations teams in the 12 months
            ended Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EU Lawmakers Back Sovereign-Debt Curbs for Ratings Companies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-ratings companies will face European Union curbs on
            how they update markets about the quality of government debt
            under plans approved by the bloc's lawmakers today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The measures, intended to make it less likely that ratings
            decisions roil markets, will also give investors the right to
            sue if they lose money because of poor quality or deliberately
            distorted credit assessments. European Parliament legislators,
            voting in Strasbourg, France, backed the plans in a compromise
            deal with the EU's 27 governments, which must now rubber-stamp
            the accord before it can take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the EU plan, each credit ratings company would pick a
            maximum of three days a year when they would be allowed to
            publish so-called unsolicited assessments of governments'
            creditworthiness. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unsolicited ratings are those that haven't been requested
            and paid for by a client. Ratings companies will be able to
            issue such ratings outside of their three dates if they can
            justify it to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Siemens Agrees to Pay $10 Million to Settle New York Fraud Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Siemens AG (SIE) unit agreed to pay $10 million to settle
            allegations made by New York prosecutors that the company lied
            about its qualifications to win more than $200 million in
            infrastructure contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical violated New York state law
            by filing false documents with two city departments, the New
            York District Attorney's Office said in a statement on its
            website Jan. 14. Siemens takes responsibility for misconduct
            committed by its former business partner Schlesinger Electrical
            Contractors Inc., Munich-based Siemens said in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York's Department of Environmental Protection awarded
            five contracts to Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical with a total
            value of $234.8 million between Aug. 31, 2005, and Jan. 19,
            2007, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.K. Will Widen Review of Financial Firm Sales Incentives &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K.'s financial watchdog is widening a probe into
            sales incentives at retail financial companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority will investigate practices
            at 'high street banks and other firms in addition to the 22
            firms that were originally assessed,' the agency said in an e-
            mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, the regulator is in talks with banks to set a
            cut-off date for claims arising from alleged improper selling of
            payment protection insurance, the London-based Times reported,
            citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The British Bankers Association has suggested a summer
            deadline in return for agreement by banks to finance an
            advertising campaign making the public aware, the newspaper
            said. The FSA is sympathetic to banks' concern that without a
            cut-off date, there may otherwise be no end to mis-selling
            claims, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The British Bankers Association declined to comment, the
            Times said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Broadband Research's Kinnucan Gets 4 Years in Insider Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Broadband Research LLC founder John Kinnucan, the expert-
            networker who refused to cooperate in a U.S. probe of insider
            trading before admitting to passing tips to hedge-fund clients,
            was sentenced to four years and three months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts yesterday in Manhattan
            federal court also ordered him to forfeit $164,000 he made in
            illegal profit. Kinnucan, who was indicted in February, pleaded
            guilty in July to one count of conspiracy and two counts of
            securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his plea, Kinnucan said he both obtained and gave tips
            to clients of his expert-networking firm, including two in New
            York. Prosecutors said he got inside information about SanDisk
            Corp. (SNDK), F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) and OmniVision Technologies Inc. (OVTI),
            including quarterly revenue numbers, after befriending employees
            of technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kinnucan was arrested Feb. 16 at his home in Portland,
            Oregon. Prosecutors said that in the two months leading up to
            his arrest, he engaged in a 'campaign' of threats and anti-
            Semitic rants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a submission by his lawyer, which hasn't been made
            public and was referred to by the government in their court
            papers, Kinnucan sought a 24-month prison term, saying his
            conduct was 'caused by stress, depression and alcohol abuse'
            after he learned he was the subject of an insider-trading
            investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Kinnucan, 12-cv-163, U.S District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Apple Sued by Belgian Consumer Group Over Product Warranties &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) is being sued by a Belgian consumer group over
            its product-warranty practices, more than a year after the iPad
            maker was fined by an Italian regulator over the same issue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Test-Aankoop/Test-Achats filed a lawsuit at the commercial
            court in Brussels claiming Apple violates laws on consumer
            guarantees, it said in a statement yesterday. It cited customer
            complaints about information provided by Apple and authorized
            distributors about the company's legal warranty, its one-year
            warranty and a warranty extension of as much as three years
            through the AppleCare Protection Plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Italy's competition agency fined Apple 900,000 euros ($1.2
            million) in 2011, saying the Cupertino, California-based company
            misled consumers by 'prominently advertising' that its
            products had a one-year manufacturer warranty and selling an
            extension when consumers have the right to an automatic two-year
            warranty. European Union Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding
            last year asked state governments to check whether Apple
            retailers failed to advertise buyers' right to the two-year
            warranty for products such as the iPhone and the iPad tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple in London, didn't
            immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;United Airlines Skirted Jet-Fuel Taxes, Illinois Agency Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;United Airlines Inc. (UAL) used a 'sham' site outside Chicago
            to avoid paying the full tax on jet fuel, the Illinois Regional
            Transportation Authority said in a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The airline's United Aviation Fuels Corp. unit, which
            purchases jet fuel for United and its regional carriers, used an
            office in Sycamore, Illinois, that has no true sales activity,
            the agency said in the complaint filed Jan. 14 in state court in
            Chicago. The office has one staff member, who doesn't work daily
            and doesn't have a computer, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;United Airlines and its unit have been engaging in the
            sales since 2001, diverting tax money owed to the agency and
            other municipalities, according to the lawsuit. The RTA asked
            for a court order barring the practice, as well as recovery for
            unpaid taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is 'without merit,' said Jennifer Dohm, a
            spokeswoman for Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc.,
            United Airlines' parent company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The operation of our fuel subsidiary in Sycamore has been
            examined by tax authorities in the past and has been determined
            to comply with all applicable laws,' Dohm said in an e-mail.
            She said the company will fight the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Regional Transportation Authority v. United
            Aviation Fuels Corp., 2013CH01023, Circuit Court of Cook County,
            Chancery Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interviews/Hearings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EU's Barroso Expects Bank-Supervisor Regulations Within Weeks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European Commission President Jose Barroso said regulations
            to create a single bank supervisor at the European Central Bank
            are proceeding quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I hope making the final step for formal adoption is a
            matter of weeks, not months,' he said in the text of a speech
            to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. Parliament
            members have worked 'very efficiently' with the council of
            European nations to speed up work on the issue, he said
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank is slated to become the single
            supervisor for euro-area banks around March 1, 2014, a year
            after regulations are set to establish oversight operations. The
            new supervisor is one condition for allowing the 500 billion-
            euro ($667 billion) European Stability Mechanism to lend
            directly to banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Brussels-based commission will move swiftly on other
            banking measures such as capital requirements, deposit-insurance
            standards and how to handle failing lenders, Barroso said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Comings and Goings/Executive Pay &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan Halves Dimon Pay, Says CEO Responsible for Lapses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon
            had his pay cut by half after a review of losses at the bank's
            chief investment office found he bears responsibility for the
            blunders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CEO's compensation for 2012 is $11.5 million, the New
            York-based bank said today on its website, compared with $23
            million a year earlier. The 2012 sum includes a $1.5 million
            salary and $10 million of incentive compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Dimon bears ultimate responsibility for the failures
            that led to the losses in CIO and has accepted responsibility
            for such failures,' the New York-based company said today on
            its website after spending about eight months reviewing what
            Dimon, 56, has called 'egregious mistakes' at the CIO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is working to rebuild investors' trust after
            losing more than $6.2 billion in last year's first nine months
            on derivatives bets by U.K. trader Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the
            London Whale because his positions were so big. The debacle
            fueled legal claims against the company and its executives, and
            regulatory probes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said its review of Dimon took into account his
            decisions to replace senior managers, efforts to claw back their
            pay and the formation of a team to examine what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dijsselbloem a 'Good' Possible Next Eurogroup Head, Faymann Says &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann praised Dutch Finance
            Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem's qualifications as the possible
            next head of the group of euro-area finance chiefs, saying he is
            a 'good candidate.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Faymann made the remarks to reporters yesterday in
            Strasbourg, France. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who has led
            the group of euro-area finance ministers since 2005, is
            preparing to step down. His successor is due to be designated on
            Jan. 21. Faymann said the 17-nation euro area has yet to reach
            an agreement on Juncker's successor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dijsselbloem, a member of the Labor Party in the
            Netherlands, was appointed Dutch finance minister in November as
            part of Liberal Prime Minister Mark Rutte's coalition government
            following elections in September. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Discloses $1.1 Billion of 2012 Reinsurance Revenue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generates the most revenue from equity trading of any bank in
            the world, said $1.08 billion of that revenue comes from its
            reinsurance business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The unit produced $880 million of revenue in 2011, Goldman
            Sachs said today as it disclosed the contribution for the first
            time in its fourth-quarter earnings report. Reinsurance revenue
            accounted for 13 percent of the bank's $8.21 billion of 2012
            equities revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is in talks to sell a majority stake in its
            reinsurance business in a deal that would value the unit at
            about $1.1 billion, The Insurance Insider reported yesterday.
            David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined
            to comment on the potential sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group has a global property and
            casualty reinsurance business as well as a life and annuity
            reinsurance operations primarily in the U.S. The bank agreed to
            in March to buy Ariel Holdings Ltd.'s Bermuda-based insurance
            and reinsurance businesses to expand property and casualty
            coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Increased reserves in the reinsurance unit added to non-
            compensation expenses, the firm said today without providing
            figures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' equities division generated about $2 billion
            more than its closest competitor in the first nine months of the
            year. &lt;/p&gt;

            weighing whether to sell a stake in its reinsurance unit, which
            generated $1.08 billion of revenue last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business may be 'better held in other people's hands
            and we can be a minority owner' after global capital rules take
            effect, Harvey M. Schwartz, who is set to become chief financial
            officer this month, said today on a conference call after New
            York-based Goldman Sachs reported fourth-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It was the first time the bank disclosed the contribution
            of its Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group. Reinsurance revenue
            climbed 23 percent last year from 2011 and accounted for 13
            percent of the firm's $8.21 billion of equities revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is in talks to sell a majority stake in the
            business in a deal that would value the unit at about $1.1
            billion, Insurance Insider reported yesterday. David Wells, a
            company spokesman, declined to comment on the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
            business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
            primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in March to buy Ariel
            Holdings Ltd.'s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
            businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Increased reserves in the reinsurance unit added to non-
            compensation expenses, the firm said today without providing
            figures. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Increase Pay for Some Staff on Cap</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
            to increase fixed pay for some senior staff and traders in
            Europe as regulators prepare to limit bonuses in the region,
            according to a person with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank plans to make so-called role-based payments to
            some senior bankers and traders in addition to their annual
            salaries and bonuses, said the person, who asked not to be
            identified because the plans haven't been made public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are seeking ways to sidestep tougher European Union
            bonus rules, which will apply for the first time to awards given
            in 2015, based on this year's performance. Regulators are
            preparing to outlaw bonuses that are more than twice fixed pay
            in what lawmakers called irresponsible risk-taking that helped
            spark the 2008 global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenders will be able to ask national regulators to exempt
            staff earning as much as 1 million euros ($1.4 million), the
            European Banking Authority said on Dec. 13. The EBA would have
            to approve any such waiver, while senior managers aren't
            eligible for the exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Britain was home to 2,188 investment bankers earning more
            than 1 million euros in 2012, the highest amount in the EU,
            while Spain had 37, according to the London-based EBA. France
            and Germany had 117 and 100 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that fourth-quarter fixed-income,
            currency and commodities trading revenue was $1.72 billion, down
            15 percent from a year earlier. Revenue from the equities
            division dropped 27 percent to $1.68 billion from a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sky News reported the news earlier today. David Wells, a
            spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) fell the most in two months after the firm, which relies more on
            trading than any of its competitors, said revenue from that business dropped 13 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trading generated $15.7 billion in 2013, or about 46 percent of the firm's total, according to a
            statement today from New York-based Goldman Sachs. That was the lowest percentage since 2002. Fourth-quarter
            net income dropped 19 percent, to $2.33 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
            Blankfein, 59, reported a fourth straight year of lower profitability than the firm achieved in the decade
            before the financial crisis. Goldman Sachs's return on equity, a gauge of profitability, was 11 percent last
            year, and the company has struggled to reach 10 percent in the past three years, a level Blankfein has
            called 'hardly aspirational.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            billion in assets under management. 'Higher capital levels and regulatory constraints make it more

            at 4:15 p.m., the biggest decline since Nov. 7. While the shares have doubled since December 2011, they are
            still below their pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut the portion of revenue it
            pays employees to the second-lowest level as a public firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation for 2013, which
            includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, fell 2.6
            percent from 2012 to $12.6 billion, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in the
            same period was little changed at $34.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C.
            Blankfein, 59, allocated 37 percent of revenue for pay in 2013, compared with 38 percent the previous year.
            While the average ratio has dropped by more than 6 percentage points since 2008, compared with the five
            years before the financial crisis, Blankfein has said he's wary of cutting too much and losing top
            performers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's always a war for talent,' Blankfein said at an investor conference
            in November. 'We're always under pressure for good people. I would say this isn't the most intense period of
            that war that we've ever experienced, but it's always there and we're always conscious of it.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reported the highest annual earnings in three years as underwriting
            revenue surged to a record and the firm's reliance on trading fell to the lowest level in more than a

        <headline>Goldman Leading Renewable Offerings Says Slump Is Ending</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top arranger for renewable-energy stock offerings last year, is
            accelerating its funding efforts as it anticipates a rebound in an industry that's slumped every year since
            2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman overtook Morgan Stanley as the biggest lead manager for share offerings
            with three deals valued at $405.6 million, according to an annual ranking by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment bank is backing renewable energy that it expects will gain favor in a
            global shift it says is inevitable. That's why short-term volatility will be trumped by long-term gains as
            emerging technologies first become commonplace and then become indispensable, according to Stuart Bernstein,
            the Goldman partner overseeing its renewables unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It feels like the worst is behind
            us,' Bernstein, 49, said in an interview from his office in San Francisco. 'I'm a contrarian, so when
            everyone else is capitulating, I think it's time to invest.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
            U.S. Clean-Energy Funds Tumble as Europe Takes Lead
            Global Clean-Energy Investment Fell 11% in 2012
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman may boost its financing efforts this year as it seeks to meet a pledge made in May to
            invest and finance more than $40 billion in the industry in the next decade. Worldwide, more than $395
            billion will be invested annually in renewable energy by 2020, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has
            made equity investments in solar developer BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) and Horizon Wind Energy, which it
            sold to EDP-Energias de Portugal SA in 2007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Goldman's Deals &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In
            September, Goldman underwrote a $225 million follow-on offering for the electric-car company Tesla Motors
            Ltd. (TSLA), along with IPOs for the rooftop photovoltaic developer SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) in December and
            the biofuel crop developer Ceres Inc. (CERE) in February. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Backing renewable
            energy isn't just an investment strategy, it's a necessity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is so
            important that when Goldman's top executives visit the West Coast, up to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
            Blankfein, 'they don't just visit our largest market-cap clients, they also spend time with our early stage
            clean-tech companies,' Bernstein said. Clean energy is 'central to the Goldman Sachs franchise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The WilderHill New Energy Global Innovation Index (NEX), known as the NEX, slumped 5.5 percent last
            year, adding to 40 percent and 15 percent declines in the two previous years as investors pared their
            appetite for risk and governments slashed incentives for the industry. The Bloomberg Industries Large Solar
            Energy (BISOLAR) index of 17 companies fell 26 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Renewable Rebound
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable shares have rebounded in the past few months as risk appetite returned. The
            NEX, which tracks 94 clean-energy stocks, has climbed more than 20 percent since Nov. 16, and the Large
            Solar index surged 81 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The market appears to have toughed in the fourth quarter
            of last year and several sectors have rallied meaningfully since then,' Bernstein said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His
            comments coincide with a deal in the U.S. to extend a tax credit that supports wind-turbine installations.
            The policy was due to expire Dec. 31 and lobbying efforts to renew it received a boost after President
            Barack Obama's re-election. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The solar industry is also gaining, with the first
            consecutive monthly increases in polysilicon prices since January 2012. Polysilicon, the raw material in
            most solar panels, has risen 1.3 percent since Dec. 24 to $16.03 a kilogram on Jan. 7, according to data
            from New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman has been investing in renewable energy since at least
            2005, and has a long-term view, said Ethan Zindler, an analyst with New Energy Finance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Credibility'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They have considerable credibility within this sector,' he said in by e-mail. 'They
            have seen the various ups and downs, so they have significant perspective as well.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            last took the top position in 2010, losing the slot to Morgan Stanley (MS) both in 2011 and in 2009. Morgan
            Stanley and UBS AG (UBSN) were co-lead managers on China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916)'s $375 million
            stock offering in December, the biggest fund-raising in the public markets in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"This
            is going to be an extraordinarily large emerging market much the same way we viewed the BRICs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            deals by Goldman last year trumped the $363.8 million managed by Shanghai-based Guotai Junan Securities Co.
            Ltd., according to data compiled by New Energy Finance, a Bloomberg research company. The Chinese company
            handled the secondary stock placement of power-generator Shanghai Aerospace Automobile Electromechanical Co.
            (600151) and Shenzhen Jiawei Photovoltaic Lighting Co. (300317)'s IPO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tesla, based in
            Palo Alto, California, has more than doubled since its June 2010 IPO, and its shares are up 49 percent in
            the past year. SolarCity has gained 77 percent since trading began. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Bring Investors'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The success of SolarCity's IPO may bring investors back to the markets and create
            future financing and MA opportunities,' Bernstein said. 'There will be interesting IPOs in several sectors
            over the next few years.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bernstein, a Goldman partner, has also worked in private
            equity and is on the selection committee for the company's clean technology and renewables group. He spends
            most of his time at Goldman's office on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, California, famous for its venture
            capital culture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment bank created Bernstein's unit about three years ago to
            focus exclusively on renewable energy and take advantage of what it saw as a promising long-term play, he
            said. He compared the industry to the technology market in the 1990s, which was once seen as fraught with
            risky new technologies that are now the backbone of the information age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We have a
            growing global population coupled with an increasing per capita consumption of energy, while fossil
            resources are finite and shrinking,' he said. Backing renewable energy isn't just an investment strategy,
            it's a necessity, he said. 'How can one not consider clean energy and renewable alternatives?' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Purge of Madoff, Goldman Probe Files Upheld by Judge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission doesn't have to restore purged files on Bernard Madoff and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) that
            were sought by a
            government watchdog group, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued
            the agency for allegedly violating federal records law by
            refusing to recover investigative files that had been destroyed.
            The group asked for documents related to the agency's
            preliminary probes under the Freedom of Information Act. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ruled
            today that the government was only required to seek recovery of
            records that were physically removed from the agency's custody
            rather than those that were done away with. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The SEC was under no duty to undertake restoration
            efforts,' the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit sought records of so-called Matters Under
            Investigation, which under a policy dating back to 1998 weren't
            stored as official files of the SEC, according to a Sept. 14,
            2011, letter to Congress from then-SEC enforcement director
            Robert Khuzami. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CREW, as the group is known, sued for materials related to
            the SEC's initial probes of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, Goldman
            Sachs's trades of American International Group Inc. credit-
            default swaps in 2009, insider-trading probes of Deutsche Bank
            AG, Lehman Brothers and SAC Capital Advisors LP, and
            investigations of possible financial fraud at Wells Fargo Co.
            and Bank of America Corp. in 2007 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Early Stages &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group, according to the lawsuit, wanted to know why
            those probes were closed at an early stage without any action by
            the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Darcy Flynn, a 13-year SEC employee, claimed in a letter to
            U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, that the
            agency destroyed documents related to those investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The most troubling aspect of the judge's opinion is his
            conclusion that the SEC is under absolutely no obligation to
            conduct any recovery efforts,' Anne Weismann, chief counsel of
            the group, said. She said the group was considering whether to
            appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group sought recovery of deleted electronic files as
            well as any physical documents that may still exist elsewhere in
            the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Messy Details' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the group filed its lawsuit, Weismann said in a
            statement that 'the public deserves to know all the messy
            details about how these investigations were conducted, and why
            they were closed at such an early stage without taking any
            action against the Bernie Madoffs of the world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the SEC's policy on closed preliminary
            investigations, the only information it retained was the title
            of the matter, its source, general subject matter, the staff
            members involved, the date it was opened and closed and other
            parties related to the inquiry, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In light of Grassley's questions and continuing discussions
            with the National Archives and Records Administration, the SEC
            halted the policy, requiring all documents created or received
            for all enforcement matters to be retained until the agency is
            certain that the policies meet federal standards, according to
            Khuzami's letter to Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in
            Washington v. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 11-cv-
            01732, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Keeping Lid on Pay Amid Rebound Cheers Investors</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
            securities firm that set a Wall Street compensation record in
            2007, is now demonstrating how little it can pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The portion of revenue allotted for salaries, bonuses,
            stock awards and benefits was 38 percent in 2012, down from 42
            percent a year earlier and the lowest since 2009, the company
            said yesterday in a statement. The move helped the bank post a
            fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates and pushed
            return on equity to 10.7 percent for the year, up from 3.7
            percent in 2011. The stock climbed the most in 10 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a better time to be an investor than when bonuses
            are becoming ridiculous,' said Michael Vogelzang, chief
            investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $2.4
            billion including Goldman Sachs shares. 'You're seeing a
            massive amount of overcapacity in the business and it's
            continuing to push down the price of labor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs still may be one of few Wall Street firms
            that pay employees more for 2012 because revenue surged 19
            percent and it cut staff by 3 percent. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the
            biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut total compensation expense at
            its corporate and investment bank 3 percent last year as revenue
            at that division rose 1 percent. The pay expense was 33 percent
            of revenue for the year, down from 34 percent in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Operating Leverage' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which is eliminating 1,600 jobs, will defer
            100 percent of bonuses for some senior bankers and traders over
            three years as it reins in costs, a person briefed on the matter
            said earlier this week. Deutsche Bank AG is weighing 2012 bonus
            cuts of as much as 20 percent for investment bankers in Europe,
            while those in New York will see smaller declines, four people
            briefed on the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anton Schutz, president of Rochester, New York-based Mendon
            Capital Advisors, said control of expenses, which rose 1 percent
            during 2012 even as revenue climbed 19 percent, is something
            Goldman Sachs investors have craved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the things we've been looking for in this space
            for a long time is operating leverage,' said Schutz, whose firm
            has about $150 million under management including Goldman Sachs
            stock. 'That's exciting for shareholders. I don't think it's so
            good for employees unless they own a lot of stock.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 1.7 percent to $143.50 by 10:52
            a.m. in German trading after climbing 4.1 percent yesterday in
            New York to $141.09, the biggest advance since March. The shares
            have gained 11 percent this year on top of a 41 percent advance
            in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank derived about 70 percent of its revenue last year
            from investments with the firm's own money or trading with
            clients. The performance of those businesses is often tied to
            the rise or fall of asset prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A stock-market rebound and a $500 million profit from
            selling a hedge-fund-administration unit helped revenue recover
            from the lowest first half since 2005 as the company booked its
            first annual revenue gain in three years. Revenue in Investing
            Lending, the segment that includes the firm's stakes in stocks,
            bonds, real estate, private equity and hedge funds, almost
            tripled last year to $5.89 billion from $2.14 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy
            Investment Group LLC, said he raised his estimates for Goldman
            Sachs's earnings per share through 2015 because he expects the
            annual compensation ratio to hold below 40 percent. He kept a
            neutral rating on the stock because he expects gains from
            private-equity and debt holdings to be lower this year and
            predicts regulations will limit trading revenue, according to a
            research note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reinsurance Business &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday that $1.08 billion of the
            firm's $8.2 billion of equity trading revenue was from the
            bank's reinsurance business, marking the first time that the
            company disclosed revenue from that segment. The firm is
            considering selling a majority stake in that unit, said Harvey M. Schwartz, who will replace Chief Financial
            Officer David A. Viniar, 57, at the end of this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank still doesn't have enough information on proposed
            regulatory changes to give a target for future return on equity,
            Schwartz, 48, said on a conference call with investors. The 10.7
            percent figure for 2012 was 'not particularly aspirational,'
            he said. 'We'd like to do better.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central bank policies have boosted asset prices, and that's
            likely to continue to contribute to higher profits at firms like
            Goldman Sachs, said Boston Advisors' Vogelzang. He said he
            expects the bank's return on equity to reach the 'mid-teens.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The way we view the ROE target is this is a very cyclical
            business, highly dependent on capital markets,' Vogelzang said.
            'Our outlook for particularly the U.S. equity markets is quite
            strong, and they're going to be levered to that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Better Balance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, has
            undertaken a $1.9 billion expense-reduction effort since mid-
            2011. That helped reduce the compensation ratio, which was part
            of an effort to strike a better balance between rewarding
            employees and shareholders, Schwartz told analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This year we hope we got the balance right,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank employed 32,400 people as of Dec. 31, 900 fewer
            than the end of 2011. It allocated $12.9 billion for
            compensation, up from $12.2 billion in 2011. That averages
            $399,506 per employee. While that's up from $367,057 in 2011,
            it's 40 percent less than the $661,490 average for 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's a reflection of how much the market has changed,
            Vogelzang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a very interesting case study in the supply-demand
            equation for high wage-earning, white-collar workers,' he said.
            'We've certainly seen it in manufacturing, we've seen it in
            lower-level services, but we're now seeing it at places like
            Goldman and Morgan Stanley. (MS)' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MFP's Price Says He Wouldn't Buy Goldman Sachs Shares</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MFP Investors LLC's Michael Price
            said he wouldn't add to his holdings in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            at the current price because the fifth-largest U.S. bank by
            assets is trading at fair value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't buy it here,' Price, said in a 'Bloomberg
            Surveillance' television interview with Tom Keene and Sara Eisen today. 'It's fair value.' He said, 'You buy
            things when
            people are selling and you sell when the sun is shining.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Price, who made his reputation as a value investor in the
            1980s by buying shares of beaten-down lenders, owned a $4.5
            million stake in Goldman Sachs, according to a September
            regulatory filing. The New York-based firm rallied 4.1 percent
            yesterday, the most in 10 months, after reporting quarterly
            profit that beat analysts' estimates and full-year revenue grew
            for the first time since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares are trading at about 10 times earnings
            and 1 times book value, Price said. The bank reported yesterday
            that fourth-quarter earnings more than tripled to $5.60 a share,
            surpassing even the highest estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're the smartest guys in the room,' Price said.
            'When you're looking at financials -- banks, brokers, insurance
            companies -- who's going to be smarter than Goldman? And you
            don't want to pay more than one times book and 10 times
            earnings. That to me is the center point.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dell LBO &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Price doesn't own shares of Dell Inc. (DELL), he said the
            chances of a leveraged buyout for the personal-computer maker
            are greater than 50 percent. The company is in discussions with
            private-equity firms including Silver Lake Management LLC,
            Bloomberg News reported on Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A tender offer for the company could be about $14 to $15 a
            share, Price said. Dell shares have surged 16 percent to $12.61
            this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is the time to do it,' Price said on Dell's
            potential buyout. Hewlett-Packard Co.'s 'probably too big to
            do. Dell is big, but not too big, to do,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Price said he owns shares of Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-
            biggest U.S. bank, and foreign-exchange broker FXCM Inc. He is
            also bullish on McGraw-Hill Cos., the educational publisher and
            financial services provider that is planning on splitting its
            two businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Sachs Head Loan Trader Meeker Joining Allen's Vulcan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sean Meeker, who departed Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. last month as the head of loan and loan credit-default swap trading, is joining Microsoft
            Corp. co-founder Paul Allen's Vulcan Capital fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meeker will start Feb. 15 as a credit specialist on the
            fixed-income money management team, reporting to director Ben Kolpa, the Seattle-based firm said today in an
            e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meeker, who will be based in Seattle, joined Goldman Sachs
            in 2003 and was named a managing director in 2010. Fourth-quarter fixed-income, currency and commodity
            trading revenue was
            $1.72 billion, down 15 percent from a year earlier, the New
            York-based bank said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield, high-risk bonds are rated
            below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and lower than BBB- at
            Standard Poor's. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
            borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
            defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to Raise Up to $1.9 Billion in German Property IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG, the apartment
            landlord owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), plans to raise as
            much as 1.4 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in an initial public
            offering poised to be the largest by a German property company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG will sell as many as 30.5 million shares for 41 euros
            to 47 euros each, the Dusseldorf-based company said in a
            statement today. That's 57.5 percent of LEG's shares. The stock
            will begin trading in Frankfurt on Feb. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which bought the company for about 3.5
            billion euros including debt in 2008, is seeking to profit from
            a boom in German residential real estate. The FTSE EPRA/Nareit
            index of German property stocks has gained 38 percent in the
            past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An investment in LEG shares offers the opportunity to
            invest in a large pure-play residential property company with
            high growth,' LEG Chief Executive Officer Thomas Hegel said in
            the statement. 'In order to achieve future growth, we
            constantly screen the market for potential acquisitions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG owns 91,000 apartments in North Rhine-Westphalia,
            Germany's most populous state. Goldman Sachs' Whitehall Street
            Real Estate fund holds about 95 percent of the company. Perry
            Capital owns the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offer period for the IPO will run from Jan. 21 to Jan.
            31. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) will be lead managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Guy Hands &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Annington Immobilien AG, Germany's largest owner
            of apartments, also plans an IPO this year. Annington,
            controlled by Guy Hands' Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., has
            about 186,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the share sale, LEG will be Germany's second-largest
            publicly traded residential landlord by properties with 91,000
            apartments. The biggest is Gagfah SA (GFJ), controlled by Fortress
            Investment Group LLC (FIG), which has about 145,000 apartments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG's profit from its main business of renting apartments
            was 243 million euros in 2011 and its funds from operations were
            111.8 million euros, according to its last annual report. FFO
            measures a property company's ability to generate cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By comparison, Gagfah generated a rental profit of 419.6
            million euros in 2011 and its FFO was 159.5 million euros,
            according to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Active Investor &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of the most active foreign investors
            in the German real estate market. In April 2011, Whitehall
            Street and Cerberus Capital Management LP raised 468 million
            euros in an IPO of Berlin-based residential landlord GSW
            Immobilien AG. (GIB) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whitehall Street also made an unsuccessful bid to buy
            Baubecon, the residential property portfolio that Barclays Plc (BARC)
            agreed to sell to Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) in May in a deal valued at
            1.24 billion euros. Whitehall Street agreed to sell its stake in
            17 German department stores, including Kaufhaus des Westens, the
            country's largest, in December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Sachs Programmer Seeks End of N.Y. Prosecution</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            programmer who won reversal of a federal conviction for stealing
            internal code from the bank asked a New York judge to dismiss
            state charges against him based on the same allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At a hearing today in New York State Supreme Court in
            Manhattan, Kevin Marino, an attorney for Sergey Aleynikov, asked
            Justice Ronald Zweibel to dismiss the charges, arguing that
            Aleynikov had the right to copy the code and that the charges
            are barred by the state's double-jeopardy statute as well as the
            Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, 42, was charged in August by the Manhattan
            District Attorney's Office and indicted the following month on
            two counts of unlawful use of scientific material and one count
            of unlawful duplication of computer-related material. He has
            pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The reality is Sergey Aleynikov has suffered enough,'
            Marino said in court. 'He has been punished enough.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Russia, was
            freed from federal prison in New Jersey in February after a U.S.
            appeals court reversed his December 2010 conviction for stealing
            the bank's trading code, saying the two laws that prosecutors
            used to charge Aleynikov -- the National Stolen Property Act and
            the Economic Espionage Act -- didn't apply to his case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;June 2009 &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors claimed that, on his last day of work
            at New York-based Goldman Sachs in June 2009, Aleynikov uploaded
            hundreds of thousands of lines of source code from the firm's
            high-frequency trading system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, a vice president in the bank's Global Equities
            Division until June 30, 2009, was part of a team responsible for
            developing and improving source code related to high-frequency
            trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York prosecutors have said that while the federal
            appellate judges ruled Aleynikov's conduct didn't constitute a
            federal crime, they suggested it could be a violation of state
            law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While New York's statute on previous prosecutions is
            broader than the double-jeopardy protection provided by the
            state and U.S. constitutions, it isn't unlimited and the case
            falls within one of the rules that allows for successive
            prosecutions, prosecutors said in court papers responding to
            Marino's bid to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Same Acts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. courts have held that a federal prosecution doesn't
            bar a subsequent state prosecution of the same person for the
            same acts under the principle of dual sovereignty, prosecutors
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York prosecutors argued that they weren't a party to
            the federal case and had no relationship to anyone who was. They
            said the jury and the judges in the federal case found beyond a
            reasonable doubt that Aleynikov had misappropriated computer
            data and that the prosecution failed only because of elements
            irrelevant to the state case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Marino argued that the state wouldn't have prosecuted
            the case without the encouragement from the FBI and federal
            prosecutors, Aleynikov can't 'seriously suppose' that the
            Manhattan District Attorney's Office would have declined to
            prosecute if the victim had contacted it first, according to the
            response. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In every case, the prosecutors rely not on bombast but on
            evidence,' Chief Assistant District Attorney Daniel R. Alonso
            said in a statement. 'The Second Circuit reversed the
            defendant's conviction on federal jurisdictional grounds in the
            face of insistent arguments by this same lawyer that the case
            was a quintessential state crime. We look forward to proceeding
            with the case.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Broader Scope &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama signed a measure on Dec. 28
            broadening the scope of the Economic Espionage Act to include
            services intended for use in commerce beyond state lines,
            including computer source codes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1996 law had applied only to products made specifically
            for use in interstate or foreign commerce, such as manufactured
            goods. It was broadened to apply to cases such as Aleynikov's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marino said his client has lost his life savings, his
            marriage, his home, his job, his reputation and his opportunity
            to work in his chosen field. Aleynikov has already served more
            than a year in federal prison for the conduct he is being
            accused of, Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a word for this prosecution, your honor,'
            Marino said. 'It's inhuman.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zweibel adjourned the case until Feb. 15 for a decision,
            although the judge said he may rule before then. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The criminal case is New York v. Aleynikov, 04447-2012, New
            York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). The New Jersey case is
            Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), 12-cv-05994, U.S.
            District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Corn Extends Best Run in Year With Goldman Bullish: Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Corn traders are the most bullish in
            seven weeks as forecasts for the smallest stockpiles relative to
            demand since 1974 prompted the longest rally in a year and
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to predict near-record prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eighteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect futures to
            gain next week and six were bearish. A further five were
            neutral, making the proportion of bulls the highest since Nov.
            30. Global consumption will exceed output for the second time in
            three years after drought from Europe to the U.S. parched crops,
            the U.S. Department of Agriculture says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The grain rose for eight successive days to $7.3125 a
            bushel by Jan. 16 as the USDA said global inventories by Sept.
            30 will be 1.4 percent lower than previously expected and,
            relative to consumption, the smallest since 1974. Prices had
            slumped for five weeks and hedge funds cut bets on a rally by 59
            percent since December on expectations that South American
            harvests in the first half of the year would boost supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're going to see a destocking in the world of grains
            and products, and everyone is going to finish the season very
            tight,' said Chris Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
            London. 'Prices need to go to $8 a bushel at least in the
            second quarter to do the job of slowing down demand.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corn Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn rose 4 percent to $7.26 on the Chicago Board of Trade
            this month, extending last year's 8 percent advance. Prices will
            jump 14 percent to $8.25 in three months, 2.8 percent below the
            Aug. 10 record, Goldman said Jan. 13. The Standard Poor's GSCI
            gauge of 24 commodities gained 1.8 percent since the start of
            January and the MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) of equities
            increased 3.3 percent. Treasuries lost 0.5 percent, a Bank of
            America Corp. index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;World stockpiles will drop 12 percent to a six-year low of
            115.99 million metric tons by October, the USDA said Jan. 11.
            Inventories in the U.S., the top grower and exporter, slid 17
            percent from a year earlier to 8.03 billion bushels (204 million
            tons) on Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Supplies dwindled as dry weather curbed yields, boosting
            prices to a record $8.49 in August. There was still moderate to
            exceptional drought across 53 percent of a nine-state Midwest
            region by Jan. 15, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed. U.S. corn
            planting begins in April. The International Grains Council said
            yesterday that global output will drop 3.6 percent to 845
            million tons in the 2012-13 crop year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Livestock Feed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The slump in prices to a six-month low on Jan. 7 may boost
            demand for livestock feed. The USDA said domestic meat and
            poultry production this year, as well as feed consumption, will
            be bigger than previously expected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other speculators cut bullish bets for five
            consecutive weeks and held a net-long position of 115,113
            futures and options by Jan. 8, the least since June 26, U.S.
            Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Futures for
            delivery in September, just before the next Northern Hemisphere
            harvest, are trading at $6.12 in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some growing nations may bolster supply. The USDA raised
            its forecast for Argentina's harvest by 1.8 percent to a record
            28 million tons. Brazil, the third-biggest shipper, after the
            U.S. and Argentina, will reap 71 million tons, about 1 million
            tons more than the agency had predicted in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. export sales of corn in the four weeks though Jan. 10
            were 68 percent lower than in the same period a year earlier,
            the USDA said yesterday. The London-based IGC expects corn
            consumption to drop 1.1 percent this year to 865 million tons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Grain Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Costlier crops may curb demand from biofuel producers. U.S.
            ethanol production fell to 784,000 barrels a day in the week
            ended Jan. 11, the lowest since the Department of Energy began
            compiling the data in June 2010. Stockpiles are up 14 percent
            since reaching a 10-month low in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More U.S. output and bigger harvests in China and Europe
            are needed to ease the mounting concern about supply, said
            Liliana Balbi, a senior economist at the United Nations' Food
            Agriculture Organization. An index of the cost of 55 food items
            tracked by the Rome-based FAO slipped for a third month in
            December, falling 1.1 percent. The gauge is still 6.7 percent
            above the five-year average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In other commodities, 17 of 30 people surveyed anticipate
            higher soybeans prices next week and nine said the oilseed will
            drop, while 17 of 28 said wheat will gain and seven expect a
            retreat. Soybeans rose 1.1 percent to $14.245 a bushel in
            Chicago this year as wheat added 1 percent to $7.86 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nine of 17 surveyed expect raw sugar to fall next week and
            seven predicted a gain. The commodity slid 5.4 percent to 18.45
            cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Metal Exchange &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sixteen people surveyed said copper will rise next week,
            seven predicted a drop and five were neutral. The metal for
            delivery in three months, the London Metal Exchange's benchmark
            contract, increased 1.7 percent to $8,067.25 a ton this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nineteen of 33 traders and analysts surveyed said gold
            would advance next week and 10 were bearish. Bullion rose 0.8
            percent to $1,688.15 an ounce in London this year after
            advancing the previous 12 years, the longest run of gains in at
            least nine decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI gauge of raw materials climbed for five
            straight weeks through Jan. 11, the best run since September,
            and global equities reached a 20-month high this week. The U.S.
            economy picked up across much of the country last month, boosted
            by auto and home sales, the Federal Reserve said Jan. 16.
            China's economy expanded for the first time in two years in the
            fourth quarter and will accelerate this quarter and next,
            according to as many as 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Economic data out of the U.S. and China has surprised to
            the upside and that's increased economic optimism,' said
            Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.
            'There's still potential for further gains from here. China is
            the most important consumer of commodities and the most
            important driver of growth in demand.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Bid to Halt Singapore Investor's Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit won
            a bid to halt Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong's lawsuit over trading losses on the
            Brazilian real in
            favor of private arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling was made in a closed hearing today at
            Singapore's High Court. Oei's lawyer Siraj Omar said he planned
            to appeal the decision. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
            spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei sued Goldman Sachs International in Singapore and the
            parent company in New York, alleging the bank misled him into
            trading real-yen options. He sought at least $31 million in
            damages in each lawsuit. The bank has rejected allegations that
            it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter it
            wrote to Oei in July and filed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei said he relied on the bank's advice that the real was a
            stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar before
            betting in May the yen would fall against the Brazilian
            currency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The real has fallen 12 percent since May 15 against the
            yen, the second-worst performer among 16 major currencies
            tracked by Bloomberg, after the South African rand. The real has
            declined three straight years as widening budget deficits
            threaten to trigger Brazil's first credit-rating downgrade since
            2002. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs plans to ask a U.S. judge to dismiss the
            lawsuit there in favor of arbitration or move it to Singapore,
            according to court papers filed in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have not brought this claim because I have lost money
            in the trades,' Oei said in court papers filed in December. 'I
            trusted and relied on Goldman Sachs and they abused and breached
            that trust.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Oei Hong Leong v Goldman Sachs International.
            S834/2013. Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nomura Predicts Rate Rise in Split With Goldman: Korea Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc., the most-accurate forecaster of Bank of Korea action in the past six
            months, is sticking with its outlook for interest-rate increases
            after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kwon Young Sun, Hong Kong-based economist at Nomura, has a
            4 percent prediction for 2014 economic expansion, faster than
            the central bank's 3.8 percent, as a rebounding U.S. economy and
            a stronger dollar ease pressure on exports. The gap between
            three- and 10-year sovereign yields widened to a three-year high
            of 79 basis points on Jan. 8 on growth optimism. The won slid
            1.1 percent against the greenback this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo, set to retire on
            March 31, will hand off a two-speed economy as exports boom and
            household debt damps domestic demand. While political pressure
            for rate cuts may intensify as President Park Geun Hye faces
            municipal elections on June 4, Nomura sees few economic reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A solid job market, bottomed-out inflation and improved
            GDP growth suggest no need to cut rates,' said Kwon, who was
            the only analyst among 16 to predict the BOK would be on hold
            rather than cut in September 2012. 'However, if the new BOK
            governor turns out to be very dovish, there is a political risk
            of a rate cut even though macro situations improve,' he said in
            a Jan. 17 e-mail interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Board members kept the benchmark rate unchanged at 2.5
            percent on Jan. 9, citing strength in Asia's fourth-biggest
            economy. That day the central bank projected growth will
            accelerate from 2.8 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Political Pressure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ruling party lawmaker Chung Woo Taik urged the BOK to cut
            its interest rate significantly to help the economy, Yonhap
            Infomax reported on Jan. 8. Easing the pace of won gains would
            be an efficient policy to protect exporters, Chung said,
            according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The political pressure may intensify as the municipal
            ballots are the biggest elections since Park took office in
            February 2013, according to a Jan. 13 report by Woori Investment
            Securities fixed-income strategist Peter Park. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs expects a 25 basis point rate cut 'in the
            near term' on concern about tightening domestic financial
            conditions, Seoul-based economist Kwon Goohoon wrote in a Jan. 9
            report. It sees a 3.7 percent expansion in the Korean economy
            this year, a Jan. 16 report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Weaker Won &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,063.60 per dollar
            yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on
            Korea's three-year government bonds fell one basis point, or
            0.01 percentage point, this year to 2.9 percent while 10-year
            rates rose eight basis points to 3.65 percent, Korea Exchange
            Inc. prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While there is a bias for the dollar to rise against the
            won, there is still the chance of a rate cut to revive the local
            economy, Adam McCabe, who helps oversee $6 billion as deputy
            head of Asian fixed income at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc in
            Singapore, said in a Jan. 15 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Korea has one of the region's more appealing bond
            markets,' he said. 'There is room for the Korean central bank
            to ease monetary policy if it needs to as the domestic economy
            continues to disappoint.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ups and Downs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The economy may not improve as projected by the central
            bank, said Moon Dong Hoon, managing director in the fixed-income
            division of KB Asset Management, which oversees 15 trillion won
            ($14.1 billion) of assets. Ups and downs in the economy may
            prompt monetary authorities to lower rates, Seoul-based Moon
            said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Household debt rose to an all-time high of 991.7 trillion
            won as of Sept. 30, central bank data showed. Sizable
            liabilities and external uncertainty can be a drag on private
            consumption and corporate investment, the BOK said on Jan. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea will probably begin to raise rates in the
            fourth quarter, according to the median estimate of 28
            economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Eight analysts from
            Barclays Plc to HSBC Holdings Plc expect a 25 basis point
            increase by the third quarter, while Goldman and ING Bank NV
            project a cut in the first and second quarters respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exports will increase 6.4 percent this year after an
            estimated 2.2 percent gain in 2013, the trade ministry said on
            Jan. 1. The unemployment rate was 3 percent last month, close to
            the record low of 2.9 percent in November. Producer prices fell
            0.4 percent in December from a year ago, the least since
            September 2012. Consumer-price inflation of 1.1 percent last
            month accelerated from a 14-year low of 0.9 percent in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The underlying trend in growth and job creation is still
            positive, with manufacturing, trade and commerce continuing to
            add jobs in December,' said Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based
            economist at Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Forecasts Gold Rally Amid Debt-Ceiling Confrontation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gold may climb over the next three
            months as U.S. lawmakers attempt to tackle the country's debt
            ceiling and the world's largest economy slows, Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. said, advising investors to place bets on advances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see current prices as a good entry point to re-
            establish fresh longs,' analysts Damien Courvalin and Alec Phillips wrote in a Jan. 18 report. The bank
            reiterated a three-
            month target of $1,825 an ounce, as well as a forecast for
            prices to weaken in the second half as the U.S. economy
            rebounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold fell 5.5 percent last quarter, the worst performance
            since 2008, on expectations for a recovery and potential end to
            central bank stimulus in the U.S. An advance to $1,825 would be
            consistent with rallies into debt-ceiling decisions, the
            analysts wrote. Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the
            debt limit 79 times, according to the Treasury Department. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The uncertainty associated with these issues, combined
            with our economists' forecast for weak U.S. GDP growth in the
            first half of 2013 following the negative impact of higher taxes
            will push gold' to the three-month target, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold, which rallied for a 12th year in 2012, traded at
            $1,687.90 an ounce on the Comex at 9:49 a.m. in New York.
            Holdings in exchange-traded products reached a record last
            month, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Most-active prices last
            traded above $1,825 an ounce in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Borrowing Limit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Treasury has said the U.S. will exceed its $16.4
            trillion borrowing authority sometime from mid-February to early
            March. Financing for government agencies is set to lapse March
            27, and lawmakers must pass new spending or cause a shutdown.
            Also in March, Congress will confront the $110 billion in
            automatic spending cuts, half from defense, that were postponed
            in a Jan. 1 tax deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman restated its outlook for lower prices in the second
            half of this year, a call echoed by Credit Suisse Group AG and
            Allan Hochreiter(Pty) Ltd., as the U.S. recovers. As growth
            improves, prices will likely decline even with continued central
            bank and exchange-traded fund demand, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold's bull market is over, Allan Hochreiter Chief
            Executive Officer Rene Hochreiter, the top forecaster in the
            London Bullion Market Association's 2012 poll, said this month.
            The metal's appeal is set to diminish as so-called fear trades
            fade, according to Credit Suisse's Tom Kendall, head of
            precious-metals research and the most accurate precious-metals
            forecaster in the past eight quarters tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Admiral Rises After Goldman Upgrades on Claims: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Admiral Group Plc (ADM), the insurer of
            3.6 million U.K. vehicles, rose the most in three months after
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) upgraded the stock, saying the company
            will benefit from the falling cost of automotive claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Admiral advanced 4.9 percent to 1,211 pence in London
            trading, the biggest climb in the FTSE 100 Index (UKX) of leading U.K.
            shares. Analysts at Goldman Sachs led by Ravi Tanna upgraded the
            stock to buy from hold and said it has the potential to return
            30 percent over the next 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Admiral has underperformed the Stoxx Europe 600 Insurance
            Index (SXIP) over the last six months as U.K. auto-insurance premiums
            declined while claims for bodily injury continued to rise. The
            British government is proposing a series of legislative changes,
            such as capping whiplash claims and limiting fees paid to so-
            called 'no win no fee' lawyers, to hold down costs and
            premiums, which doubled in the three years through 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe there is potential for claims inflation to
            decline faster than the market expects,' Tanna wrote in a note
            to clients today. 'As a result of renegotiated reinsurance
            terms, the group has significant gearing towards lower claims
            inflation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer, led by chief executive officer, founder and
            biggest shareholder Henry Engelhardt, reinsures about half its
            premiums with companies including Munich Re. After renegotiating
            terms with its reinsurers, Admiral is entitled to 90 percent of
            its underwriting profit while taking 25 percent of the risk,
            Tanna said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This makes it the most geared company in our coverage to
            improving trends in motor claims,' Tanna said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Matsui Turns Abe to Womenomics for Japan Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When her sister graduated from
            Harvard University in 1981, Kathy Matsui's father gave her a
            choice: Get accepted, or get ready for a lifetime of labor
            raising roses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From the farm in Salinas, California, to Harvard and
            Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. in Tokyo, the family work ethic has
            underpinned a career that lifted Matsui to the top of her
            profession. Now, 14 years after publishing her ideas on how to
            upend gender roles in the Japanese workforce under a doctrine
            known as womenomics, Matsui has the ear of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who made her research into a plank of
            his growth plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Warmness alone doesn't make flowers bloom,' Andy Matsui,
            whose daughter later became Goldman Sachs' first female partner
            in his native Japan, said in a telephone interview last month.
            'You never hear a success story for a spoiled child.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kathy Matsui arrived 24 years ago at her first brokerage
            job in Tokyo at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities speaking
            conversational Japanese. The mother of two, now 48 and fluent,
            joined Goldman Sachs as chief Japan equity strategist in 1994
            and was ranked the No. 1 stock market forecaster for Japan in
            2000, 2001 and 2006 by Institutional Investor magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matsui's interest in gender issues was piqued by her own
            climb. She published the first womenomics report in August 1999,
            arguing that equalizing roles in the workforce was a better
            solution to Japan's shrinking labor pool than loosening
            immigration laws or raising the birth rate. Back then, the
            proportion of working-age women with jobs was 56.7 percent,
            according to the Statistics Bureau. In 2012, it was 60.7
            percent, a record, though still not high enough, she says. In
            the U.S., 69 percent of women between 25 and 54 had jobs in
            2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Change Needed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's aging population and a debt burden twice as big as
            its economy mean more must be done fast, according to Matsui. By
            2035, one third of all Japanese will be 65 or older, up from 23
            percent in 2010, according to the National Institute of
            Population and Social Security Research. Japan could expand its
            workforce by 8 million and increase its gross domestic product
            as much as 14 percent by raising women in employment to about 80
            percent, the same level as men, Matsui wrote in an April report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have to convince the Japanese people that running a
            marathon with one leg is going to take a very long time,'
            Matsui said in an interview last month. 'It's still an alien
            concept that women might be working full-time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Work Ethic &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matsui attributes her own work ethic to growing up in
            Salinas. She attended Japanese language school on Saturdays,
            went to church on Sundays and cut flowers by hand after classes
            the rest of the week. Her mother, Mary, toiled in the family
            nursery every day and learned English at night while raising
            four children. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Despite wearing four layers of gloves, you still ended up
            with thorns in your hands,' Kathy Matsui said. 'But we got
            used to it, that was our life. In my family, money didn't just
            fall from the sky.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With degrees in social studies from Harvard in Cambridge,
            Massachusetts, and international affairs from Baltimore-based
            Johns Hopkins University, Matsui visited Japan for the first
            time in 1986 on a Rotary scholarship. She moved to Tokyo to be
            with Jesper Koll, now her husband, whom she met during an
            internship at Mitsui Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Vital Component' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Invoking Matsui by name in a Sept. 25 essay for the Wall
            Street Journal, Japan's Abe said womenomics is a 'vital
            component' of his growth strategy. The premier has said he
            wants a society where 'women can shine' by eliminating waiting
            lists for childcare and training mothers returning to work. He
            has encouraged publicly-traded companies in Japan to have at
            least one female executive and set a goal of women holding 30
            percent of leadership positions in all areas of society by 2020,
            when Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Since he elevated this issue and made it a core part of
            his growth strategy agenda, people started waking up,' Matsui
            said. 'The fact that he is even mentioning it is massive
            progress compared to any of his predecessors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Promoting women's rights in Japan has long been a losing
            battle. The World Economic Forum ranked the Asian nation 105th
            out of 136 nations in its 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, which
            measures economic, political, education and health differences
            between men and women. Iceland was No. 1, followed by Finland
            and Norway. The U.S. was 23rd and China 69th. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Female Managers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Japan, female executives make up about 11 percent of
            managerial jobs in the private sector, according to 2012 data
            from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Women are paid
            about 71 percent as much as men, according to the ministry.
            About 62 percent of Japanese women quit their jobs after their
            first child is born, according to the IPSS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many of Matsui's friends did. She thought about what would
            happen if they kept working and it prompted her to write the
            first report on gender in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Very few of my Japanese clients reacted to it at the
            time, though that wasn't surprising since 99.9 percent of them
            were male,' she said. 'Since I had 'three strikes' against me
            as an inexperienced, foreign, female strategist, I knew the only
            way I could succeed was to write differentiated research.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Competitors noticed a report that went past stock picking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The female labor participation had risen in the 1990s,
            but I found it interesting how she shed light on it,' said
            Chisato Haganuma, chief equity strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
            Morgan Stanley Securities Co., who has been Matsui's competitor
            for about 20 years. 'It was a very good report and strategy in
            that it highlighted a change in our society rather than just
            talking about which stocks would rise and fall.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock-Picking &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a study released on Oct. 1, 2010, Matsui listed 44
            public companies in industries from daycare to nursing and food
            preparation that she said reflected women's values. They rose 86
            percent through Dec. 27, compared with a 55 percent increase for
            the Topix index, according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her broader forecasts for Japanese equities have usually
            been bullish, a stance that paid off last year when the Nikkei
            225 Stock Average (NKY) beat every developed-market index. In
            November, she raised her 12-month projection for the Topix to
            1,450, about 11 percent higher than the gauge's 2013 close and a
            level unseen since 2007. The measure rose 0.2 percent to
            1,295.95 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Logic, intuition and contacts inform the calls, said Hiromi
            Suzuki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Goldman Sachs who has worked
            with Matsui since 1994, when they started the firm's strategy
            team for Japanese stocks. She described Matsui, who was named
            managing director in 1998 and partner in 2000, as a serious,
            energetic and honest person who doesn't micromanage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long Hours &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'She's tough mentally and physically and sticks to her
            schedule,' Suzuki said in an interview on Jan. 10. 'She always
            tries her best to fulfill what she intends to do. Even if she
            has five minutes to the deadline, she focuses on what she can do
            within that time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A nanny has enabled Matsui to work long hours and travel,
            while her husband, Koll, runs Japanese equity research at
            JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. The biggest challenge came in
            2001, after her second child was born, when she was diagnosed
            with breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Just when I thought nothing could go wrong, everything
            went wrong,' she said. 'You just don't know what twists and
            turns life brings. I was naturally shocked when I received my
            diagnosis, but facing my mortality at the age of 36 was actually
            a giant wake-up call.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She took eight months off to recuperate in California with
            her parents and received chemotherapy. She returned to Goldman
            Sachs wearing a wig, deciding that staying at home all the time
            would be more stressful. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Demonstrating Womenomics' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I saw how hard she worked when she faced difficulties and
            I learned what it's like to be a strategist,' said Naoki Kamiyama, who worked for Matsui from 2000 to 2002
            and is now
            chief equity strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co.
            'In a way, she's demonstrating womenomics by herself. It's
            perfectionism. She embodies it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matsui's travel usually keeps her away from her family for
            two to three months a year, triggering 'maternal guilt,' she
            said. 'While it may be a sign that you're really busy, I always
            feel guilty about spending so much time away from my husband and
            children.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yoga at 8 a.m. on Saturdays helps her body, and Nutella, a
            Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, warms her spirit. When times are
            toughest, though, Matsui said she thinks about her mother. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I learned a tremendous amount from my mother and
            developed a newfound respect for her the minute I became a
            mother myself,' she said. 'Whenever I have those moments when
            I'm really stressed out, I just think about what my mom had to
            go through and it puts everything in perspective.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nickel Seen Extending Rally by Goldman on Indonesia Ban</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel, the best-performing
            industrial metal this year, may extend its rally as Indonesia's
            ban on unprocessed ore exports crimps supply, according to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its 12-month price target on the metal used
            in stainless steel to $16,000 a metric ton from $15,000,
            analysts including Christian Lelong said in a report today. That
            would mean a 10 percent gain from now. Goldman also listed zinc
            and palladium among its top picks on tightening supplies, while
            iron ore and copper have 'the greatest downside' risks, it
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel climbed 4.8 percent this year, the most among the
            six major metals on the London Metal Exchange as Indonesia
            restricted shipments starting Jan. 12. The global nickel market
            may swing into a deficit next year, Barclays Plc and Macquarie
            Group Ltd. estimate, while Citigroup Inc. forecasts the price at
            $17,000 a ton this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are increasingly bullish on nickel on a 12-month
            horizon,' Lelong and other analysts said in the report. 'The
            marginal cost of nickel supply will rise sharply as a result of
            the recent ban on unprocessed ore exports from Indonesia, with
            the potential for a shortage of nickel ore in late 2014.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's base case scenario is for a balanced nickel
            market in 2014 and a moderate deficit in 2015, which assumes
            some relaxation of the export ban by Indonesia, the top producer
            of mined nickel. Prices will 'substantially overshoot' the
            bank's projections if the country doesn't relax the ban,
            according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel for delivery in three months on the LME touched
            $14,750 a ton on Jan. 17, the highest since Oct. 30, and traded
            at $14,560 a ton at 1:33 p.m. in Hong Kong. Copper was little
            changed at $7,318 a ton and is down 0.6 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore and copper may decline 21 percent and 15 percent,
            respectively, amid forecast surpluses this year, according to
            the bank's report. Its 12-month estimate for copper was
            unchanged $6,200 a ton, it said. The outlook for the next 12
            months for zinc was also remained the same at $2,100 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Names Equities Head Chavez to Management Committee</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
            that generates the most revenue from equity trading worldwide,
            named R. Martin Chavez, one of the leaders of that business, to
            its management committee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman announced Chavez's appointment in an internal memo
            from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President
            Gary D. Cohn that was obtained by Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based firm,
            confirmed the
            contents of the memo. Chavez runs the equity-trading business
            with Michael D. Daffey and Paul M. Russo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chavez, 48, is a director of the International Swaps and
            Derivatives Association and oversees Goldman Sachs's principal
            strategic investments group, which invests in exchanges and
            other trading facilities. He has co-founded technology companies
            Quorum Software Systems and Kiodex, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Marty's previous work in the technology industry, his
            cross-divisional experience and his deep insight into regulatory
            reform, market structure and operational infrastructure will add
            a unique perspective to the management committee,' Blankfein
            and Cohn wrote in the memo. 'This will be particularly valuable
            as our sales and trading businesses, and the ways in which our
            clients transact, continue to evolve.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $8.2 billion of revenue from equity
            trading, almost $3 billion more than its closest U.S.
            competitor, Morgan Stanley. Goldman disclosed last week that
            $1.08 billion of that revenue came from its reinsurance
            business, which it is considering selling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The management committee will remain at 30 members once
            David Viniar, the firm's chief financial officer until the end
            of this month, departs and joins the board of directors. Reuters
            reported the appointment earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Forint Drops Most in Week as Goldman Sees Slump on Policy Change</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The forint weakened the most in
            almost a week as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast a slump in
            the currency on concern a change in leadership at the central
            bank may bring monetary loosening via unconventional methods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint depreciated 0.6 percent to 294.76 per euro by
            4:31 p.m. in Budapest, the biggest drop since Jan. 16. Yields on
            the government's benchmark 10-year local-currency bonds rose
            eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.41 percent,
            the highest in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint has slumped 1.7 percent in the past month on the
            expectation that the new president due to take over at Hungary's
            central bank in March will ease monetary policy in a non-
            traditional way. Goldman Sachs cited such a threat from the
            Magyar Nemzeti Bank while revising its forecast for the forint
            to 292, 303 and 303 in 3, 6, and 12 months, from 282, 285, and
            288, respectively. Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) and broker
            Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. also projected a forint slump, citing
            the same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The actual shift to more accommodative policies is likely
            to lead to a sell-off,' Goldman analysts Magdalena Polan and
            Themistoklis Fiotakis wrote in a report yesterday. The
            currency's decline was 'driven primarily by increasing market
            concerns over the succession in the leadership of the National
            Bank of Hungary and policy statements indicating government's
            higher tolerance for weaker forint.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government may nominate Economy Minister Gyorgy
            Matolcsy to replace central bank President Andras Simor in
            March, hvg.hu reported late yesterday. Matolcsy has urged the
            bank to 'bravely use unorthodox tools' and follow the European
            Central Bank in providing stimulus for the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Prolonged Depreciation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint may weaken 'well beyond 300' in the first half
            of 2013 because of the expected shift in monetary policy,
            Budapest-based broker Equilor said in a report today. A
            subsequent change in government rhetoric may then bring the
            forint back to 290 by year-end, Equilor said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The government's tolerance for prolonged depreciation is
            still limited,' the Goldman analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government targets a forint rate of 285 per euro as
            substantial depreciation would be dangerous, Mihaly Varga,
            Hungary's chief aid negotiator, said Jan. 20. Varga's comments
            helped recoup forint losses after Matolcsy said Jan. 10 he
            opposes strengthening the forint to fight inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint appreciated 8.1 percent against the euro and 10
            percent to the dollar last year, the biggest advance among more
            25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the
            Polish zloty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;IMF Aid &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hungary, which requested International Monetary Fund aid in
            November 2011, stands little chance of obtaining a bailout as
            views on the type of bailout and Hungary's growth prospects
            differ too much between the IMF and the Cabinet, Varga said in
            an M1 television interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint may weaken to 300 per euro by March, Wolfgang Ernst, a Vienna-based analyst at
            Raiffeisen, wrote in a research
            report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ernst cited the unresolved question of the central bank
            succession, the 'unlikely' success in IMF talks, Hungary's
            'bleak' economic outlook and last week's warning from Fitch
            Ratings that it's not planning to upgrade the country to
            investment grade in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Wins Bucking Consensus on Call for Cuts: Turkey Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s non-consensus call that Turkey's central bank would act to stem capital
            inflows at the risk of higher loan growth was vindicated as the bank cut interest rates today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ankara-based bank lowered its overnight lending and borrowing rates by 25 basis points each,
            while leaving the 5.5 percent benchmark one-week repurchase rate unchanged, in line with Goldman Sachs
            economist Ahmet Akarli's call on Jan. 18. The reductions were made to 'contain risks on financial stability'
            amid accelerating capital inflows that have boosted the lira and helped prolong the best bond rally in
            emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Akarli was the only one of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg to
            correctly predict today's move, with the median forecast calling for no change in rates as rising loan
            growth threatens to increase the inflation rate and widen the current-account deficit. The central bank's
            priority last year was to limit lending growth that had exploded in 2011, driving the deficit up and leading
            to an 18 percent decline in the lira against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The bank has shifted focus
            towards the financial stability risks posed by accelerating capital inflows, and away from inflation,'
            Akarli, who was not immediately available for comment today, said in an e-mailed note before the rates
            decision. Interest-rate cuts 'will be used to lean against these inflows and their subsequent currency
            appreciation pressures,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Credit Rating &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accelerating
            inflows meant 'the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels' and to deliver 'a limited
            downward shift in the interest rate corridor,' the central bank said in a statement accompanying its rate
            cuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The interest-rate corridor is a policy tool unique to Turkey, allowing central
            bank Governor Erdem Basci to adjust the effective borrowing rate daily by extending funding through a duo of
            rates. At today's meeting he cut the overnight borrowing rate to 4.75 percent and the overnight lending rate
            to 8.75 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira appreciated against 27 out of 31 major currencies this month,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That brought the central bank's real effective exchange rate close
            to the 120 reading which Basci said in November would be a cause for concern. The index measures the lira's
            purchasing power against the currencies of Turkey's main trading partners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lira Gains
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira strengthened to 1.7530 per dollar on Jan. 17, the strongest level since Feb.
            29 last year, on bets Moody's Investors Service will raise Turkey's credit rating to investment grade.
            Barclays Plc, Societe Generale SA and Morgan Stanley are among banks that have said Moody's may upgrade
            Turkey this year, a move that would help include the country in more global bond indexes and generate
            additional investment flows, after Fitch Ratings raised government debt to investment-grade ranking in
            November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moody's today said it was scheduling a teleconference on Jan. 28 to discuss
            Turkey's 'strengthening profile' and shift 'closer to an investment grade sovereign rating.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            lira dropped 0.4 percent to 1.7719 at 6:55 p.m. in Istanbul after the rate cuts, erasing as much as 0.3
            percent of gains on the Moody's announcement. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds dropped three basis points
            to 5.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Credit Expansion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excessive currency appreciation
            increases 'systemic risk and can have a damaging effect on macroeconomic and financial stability,' Basci
            said Dec. 25. The governor has used the rates corridor to control the flow of money and curb the
            current-account deficit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The central bank wants to keep credit growth within a 14
            percent to 15 percent range, Deputy Governor Turalay Kenc said during a roundtable discussion arranged by
            Euromoney Institutional Investor Plc (ERM) in Vienna Jan. 15. Bank loans grew 17 percent to 805 billion
            liras ($457 billion) in the 12 months to Jan. 11, according to data from the banking regulator yesterday.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We think that the cut in the upper end might support overall economic activity, which
            was not necessarily needed since economic activity already started to gain momentum,' Ozgur Altug, chief
            economist at brokerage BGC Partners in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed report today. 'The central bank's
            signal via cutting the lower end hints that it will not allow the lira to become an overvalued currency.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Real Rate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Five-year credit-default swaps on Turkey were unchanged
            at 126 basis points today. That compares with 135 for Russia, 82 for Poland and 156 for South Africa. Rising
            prices show worsening perceptions of a borrower's creditworthiness, and declining prices the reverse. The
            contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or cash if a borrower fails to
            adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold Turkish debt
            denominated in dollars rather than U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 178,
            according to JPMorgan Chase Co.'s EMBI Global Index. The premium compares with the emerging-market average
            at 265. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lira's gain this month has come after the central bank's real effective
            exchange rate fell to 118.3 in December from 119.4 in November. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The real effective
            exchange rate has approached the central bank's threshold of 120,' Emre Tekmen and Selim Cakir,
            Istanbul-based analysts at BNP Paribas SA, said by e-mail yesterday. 'Strong risk appetite' may lead to
            renewed appreciation pressure on the lira, prompting the central bank to cut its overnight borrowing rate,
            they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;First Solar, the world's biggest maker of thin-film modules
            and a top panel supplier in India, bid for 30 megawatts. The
            Tempe, Arizona-based company is diversifying into building
            plants and selling power, betting that's a better way to make
            money than competing with Chinese rivals on panel sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The tender is the most attractive yet in a market expected
            to draw $11.7 billion of investment by 2017 as the cost of solar
            power drops to equal that of other sources, according to
            Bloomberg New Energy Finance. For the first time, India is
            offering grants that will improve plants' revenue security by
            allowing them to produce power more cheaply rather than relying
            on cash-strapped state utilities to pay above-market tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;World Bank-backed Azure Power India Pvt. and Welspun Energy
            Ltd., a unit of Leon Black's Apollo Global Management LLC-backed
            Welspun Group, entered bids for the most capacity, 200 megawatts
            and 160 megawatts respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Solar Energy Corp. will evaluate technical bids first and
            open the financial offers by the end of February, Managing
            Director Rajendra Nimje said this week. Previous tenders in the
            country drove rates for solar power down to record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bidding will be more rational this time,' as a recovery
            in panel prices from a three-year slide and the rupee's
            volatility raise project costs, Gaurav Sood, managing director
            of French developer Solairedirect SA's local unit, said in an e-mail. Solairedirect, which bid for 30
            megawatts of capacity, won
            a project with a record-low bid in a December 2011 auction after
            pledging to sell solar power 30 percent cheaper than the world
            average at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Co-Head of Brazil Investment Banking Will Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s co-head
            of investment banking in Brazil, Fabio Bicudo, will leave the
            company 10 months after taking the job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs confirmed his departure yesterday in an e-mailed statement. The firm declined to say
            whether it will
            replace Bicudo, who has led Brazil investment banking since
            March with co-head Antonio Pereira. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo said in a separate statement he had been invited to
            lead a Brazilian company he declined to name. Reuters reported
            that Bicudo will become chief executive officer of Eneva SA, the
            utility controlled by EON SE and former billionaire Eike
            Batista, citing a person familiar with the matter. Eneva
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
            Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
            the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
            Sachs's revenue from investment banking had been falling in
            Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
            people familiar with the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About a quarter of Goldman Sachs's roughly 45-person Brazil
            investment-banking division have departed, four people with
            knowledge of the moves said in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our headcount in Brazil is going to be steady at around
            300 people, though it may go up 5 percent or down 5 percent,'
            Stephen Scherr, Goldman Sachs's chief for Latin America and
            global head of the investment bank's financing group, said in an
            interview in New York in October. 'The composition of the
            people is going to change -- and that is by design,' Scherr
            said, declining to comment on specific departures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira were named co-heads of investment
            banking for the country after Daniel Wainstein, one of only two
            Goldman Sachs partners who are Brazilian, left the company in
            June after 13 years. Wainstein joined New York-based Greenhill
            Co. in October. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Libyan Investment Authority Sues Goldman Sachs in London</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Libyan Investment Authority, the north African nation's sovereign wealth fund, sued Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in the U.K. over investments worth more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman
            Sachs abused the relationship of trust and confidence with the then newly-formed LIA, being the sovereign
            wealth fund of the Libyan people,' a spokesman for the fund, who declined to give his name in line with
            company policy, said in an e-mailed statement today. The fund suffered 'significant losses.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libya's
            sovereign wealth fund built up assets of about $60 billion under Muammar Qaddafi, who was deposed and killed
            in a 2011 coup. The LIA lost about $1.75 billion betting on structured products in 2007 and 2008, about $900
            million of which was with Goldman Sachs, its former chairman said in June 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion:
            What Was Goldman Sachs Doing With Libya's Options Bets?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The details of the lawsuit, filed
            Jan. 21 at London's High Court, aren't yet public. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Goldman Sachs's
            dealings with the LIA for possible violations of American anti-corruption laws. The fund has said it is
            cooperating with the authority. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fund Size &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libya has the
            second-largest sovereign wealth fund in Africa with about $65 billion, according to the Sovereign Wealth
            Fund Institute, and the 20th largest in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mohsen Derregia, the fund's former
            chairman, said in March of last year it had demanded an explanation from Societe Generale SA (GLE) on how
            derivative contracts lost about $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Losses between 15 and 16 percent are
            considered acceptable, but our shares devalued by up to 80 percent,' he said in an interview. 'We want to
            know what happened.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is: The Libyan Investment Authority v. Goldman Sachs
            International, case no. 14-310, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sells 1 Billion Euros of Madrid Debt Amid Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs International sold 1
            billion euros ($1.33 billion) of a Sept. 15, 2026, Madrid region
            note today as the second-biggest contributor to Spain's economy
            seeks to benefit from a rally in the nation's securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman placed the notes privately while five banks took
            part in the syndicated sale of a 2018 note, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. The five-year notes were sold at a spread of 190
            basis points over the reference 2018 Treasury bond, according to
            people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named
            because they're not authorized to speak about it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The region tapped the markets after the Treasury yesterday
            saw record demand for a 10-year bond. Spain's Cabinet last week
            gave Madrid, Galicia, Navarra and Aragon a green light to issue
            4.4 billion euros of bonds amid a surge in investor interest for
            Spanish shares as well as government and corporate debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madrid's economy department said it has sold the 2.3
            billion euros of debt it was authorized to issue on Jan. 18 and
            that details will be given today at 5 p.m. in Madrid. The amount
            represents about 60 percent of the region's 2013 funding needs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a Madrid-based
            consultancy, estimates gross debt sales from the regions of
            about 30 billion euros this year, excluding short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Treasury plans to raise 23 billion euros for the
            nation's regional rescue fund known as FLA, created last year to
            prevent any regional default, and that was tapped by nine of 17
            semi-autonomous regions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Budget Ministry has imposed a debt ceiling of 172
            billion euros on the regions this year, or 16 percent of gross
            domestic product. That compares with outstanding debt of 167
            billion euros in the third quarter and includes 102 billion
            euros of bank loans, with the remainder mostly in bonds,
            according to the Bank of Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is the bank that generates the
            most revenue from equity trading worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Defended by Danish Lawmaker in Dong Buyout Dispute</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the right investor for Dong Energy A/S, a top official of
            Denmark's ruling Social Democrats said, defending the Wall Street firm against criticism from other
            parliament members. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman's European merchant banking unit is seeking to buy an 18
            percent stake in state-controlled Dong, a utility in need of new equity after losing money on failed natural
            gas bets. Some Danish lawmakers want to block the 8 billion-krone ($1.5 billion) purchase, saying Goldman
            Sachs bears responsibility for the global financial crisis and that the government is giving the New
            York-based company too much control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If we were to not deal with banks until we had
            bashed all those who deserved to get bashed, we would never get anywhere, and we have to move on,' Benny
            Engelbrecht, the Social Democrats' business spokesman, said in an interview in Copenhagen. 'Applying that
            kind of logic would leave us without any banks to work with.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the
            government's Dec. 3 proposal, Goldman Sachs will be able to veto a possible sale of new shares or hybrid
            capital, any change in Dong's senior management or acquisitions before a possible 2018 initial public
            offering. The state will retain a 57.3 percent stake in Skaerbaek-based Dong, which also operates offshore
            wind parks and explores for oil and gas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Fascinated' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other
            minority owners are ATP and PFA, the country's two largest pension funds, as well as five local energy
            companies. Neither will get the same veto powers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Red-Green Alliance, which has 12
            of 179 seats in parliament, says the state, not Goldman Sachs, should inject the money that Dong needs. The
            alliance, which includes former members of Denmark's communist party, has filed more than 100 questions to
            the finance ministry regarding the sales process and the privileges given to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We
            would have liked if the government had considered who Goldman are and what they want,' Stine Brix, the
            deputy financial speaker for the party, said in an interview. 'Goldman has a very doubled-faced story. On
            one hand, everybody is fascinated with how good they are, but they also act without guilt or remorse.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Abusive' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in July 2010 agreed to pay $550 million and change
            its business practices to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's claims that the firm misled
            investors in a 2007 product linked to subprime mortgages. The firm didn't admit or deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A U.S. Senate subcommittee's report in 2011 said Goldman Sachs relied on 'abusive' sales practices
            and was rife with conflicts of interest that encouraged putting profits ahead of clients. While Goldman
            Sachs said it disagreed with many of the Senate report's finding, the firm also noted that it undertook a
            review of its business practices and released a 63-page report on its findings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is
            a long-term investment and we support the management team's current strategy across the company's
            activities, including the significant renewable energy investments,' Sophie Ramsay, a London-based
            spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. 'This strategy, supported by the
            Danish State and other minority shareholders, will create value for all shareholders in the years to come.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Morally Wrong &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Selling to Goldman Sachs is morally wrong,
            jeopardizes Denmark's green agenda and will prove to be a financial mistake, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a former
            Danish prime minister, was quoted as saying in an interview published by newspaper Politiken today. Nyrup
            Rasmussen, a Social Democrat, has also served as leader of the Europe-wide socialist group in the European
            Union. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bjarne Corydon, Denmark's current finance minister and also a Social Democrat,
            defended the sale in an interview broadcast by TV2 News. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I can understand that there's
            a debate about banks' behavior in the wake of the financial crisis,' Corydon said in response to Nyrup
            Rasmussen's comment. 'Dong was in a situation where money was needed. We have chosen a proactive answer, the
            green answer, by going with the investment strategy.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Opposition Growing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Danish People's Party, which has 22 seats in Denmark's assembly, initially backed the
            government's plan to find private investors for Dong. Now the party has threatened to withdraw its support.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't understand why Goldman should be able to hire and fire the management or why
            they need to be able to veto the strategy when it's already in place,' said Rene Christensen, financial
            spokesman for party. 'The government says there's no need to worry about the clauses, but that only made us
            more curious as to why they had to make them in the first place.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as opposition to
            the Goldman Sachs deal is growing, the government will probably be able to pass the proposal with the
            support of the Conservative Party and the Liberals Party, Engelbrecht of the Social Democrats said. The
            Liberals are Denmark's biggest opposition party. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Engelbrecht last year led lawmakers'
            push for rules that require Denmark's biggest lenders, including Danske Bank A/S to hold additional capital
            reserves to prevent a future banking crisis. While Goldman played a role in the financial crisis, the bank
            is no worse than others, Engelbrecht said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman is getting bashed for the same
            reason Danske Bank got bashed. It's the icon of capitalism and greed, though at a whole different level than
            Danske Bank,' he said. 'The critics forget that this investment is being made by the division in Goldman
            that actually specializes in renewables, and with the level of professionalism displayed by Goldman, that's
            not a bad thing.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Sutherland Attacks Migration Curbs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International Chairman
            Peter Sutherland said curbs on migration are 'ridiculous' as
            employers struggle to find skilled workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is ridiculous to stop migration when the demographic
            profile of so many countries demands it,' including the U.K.,
            he said after a panel discussion today at the World Economic
            Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Access to sufficient skilled workers is 'getting worse'
            in many developed countries, while immigrants' role in society
            is 'overwhelmingly positive,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Immigration has become a growing issue in British politics
            in recent years as opponents of U.K. membership of the European
            Union, which allows free movement of workers from across the
            bloc into Britain, have become more vocal. Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives say they want to see
            net annual
            migration from outside the EU cut to below 100,000, and a leaked
            Home Office document last month suggested an annual cap on
            migration from within the bloc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some politicians, including Business Secretary Vince Cable
            from Cameron's Liberal Democrat coalition partners and
            Conservative London Mayor Boris Johnson, have expressed
            skepticism about immigration controls, warning they could hamper
            British businesses. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Cohn Says Bonds Pose Big Risk After Record Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Debt markets that have seen junk-
            bond yields drop to record lows may face a ''substantial
            repricing'' if interest rates spike or investors begin pulling
            money out of fixed-income, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
            Gary Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A sudden or large increase in rates would be a shock to
            markets, presenting ''a big risk'' with ''a low probability,''
            Cohn, 52, said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television's
            Erik Schatzker at the World Economic Forum in Davos,
            Switzerland. Such a move would potentially be heightened by a
            liquidity shortage as large banks cut holdings to comply with
            new capital requirements, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;''I'm concerned when money starts flowing out of fixed-
            income funds, with firms trying to reduce their risk-weighted
            assets and firms trying to reduce their balance sheets, who will
            be the ultimate buyer of those fixed-income products?' Cohn
            said. 'Someone has to buy them, and maybe it takes a fairly
            substantial repricing of fixed income to find the next round of
            buyers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have funneled cash into junk bonds at a record
            pace as the Federal Reserve holds benchmark interest rates
            between zero and 0.25 percent and buys back bonds to suppress
            borrowing costs. Bond sales by Spain and Portugal this week are
            among signs that the European sovereign-debt crisis has eased.
            Buyers of fixed-income products must be told that 'just because
            it is a bond doesn't mean that it trades at par,' Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inventories Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 13 largest investment banks have announced plans to cut
            $1.03 trillion in risk-weighted assets, consulting firm McKinsey
            Co. said in a report yesterday. Inventory holdings of
            corporate bonds by top dealers have dropped about 40 percent
            from two years ago and are less than a quarter of their 2007
            peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot of the banks have a new plan of de-risking their
            balance sheets, getting their risk-weighted assets down to try
            to improve their equity ratios,' Cohn said. 'And I'm not sure
            that that capital can come back into the market quick enough'
            if there's a sell-off, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn is not the first to warn of a potential liquidity
            squeeze for institutional investors that have driven junk bond
            yields to record lows. Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm
            that surveys large investors, said in a report this month that
            banks have increasingly relied on electronic trade crossing, a
            process that depends on a large number of buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When everyone wants to sell, there will be no one on the
            other side to cross trades with and capital-constrained banks
            will have no interest in assuming their traditional role of
            liquidity backstops,' Andrew Awad, a Greenwich consultant, said
            in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Widest Gap &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on dollar-denominated junk bonds dropped to an
            unprecedented 6.46 percent on Jan. 22, and prices rose to 105.6
            cents from as low as 54.8 cents in December 2008, according to
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields over benchmarks for junk debt owned by exchange-
            traded funds are 2.03 percentage points less than for below-
            investment-grade bonds that they don't hold, the widest gap on
            record, according to Bank of America Corp. The difference
            between yields on offerings above and below $400 million has
            widened to about the highest level since February 2009, as
            investors favor bonds sold in the most liquid batches. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Portugal sold 2.5 billion euros ($3.34 billion) of five-
            year bonds through banks, the first offering of that maturity in
            almost two years. Spain sold 7 billion euros of 10-year bonds on
            Jan. 22, a sale Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said had the
            biggest demand in the nation's history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At some point, interest rates will go higher again, and
            all of the money that has piled into fixed income over the past
            three years, some of it will come out,' Cohn said. 'We will
            clearly be there to facilitate, we will clearly be there to
            provide balance sheet and liquidity to our clients, but
            ultimately, we can't be the buyer of last resort.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ukrainian Economy to Contract This Year, Goldman Sachs Predicts</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine's economy is set to shrink
            in 2013, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said, contradicting Prime
            Minister Mykola Azarov's 3 percent-4 percent growth forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product will probably contract 1.8 percent
            this year, Andrew Matheny, a Moscow-based analyst at Goldman,
            said today by e-mail. GDP, which fell 1.3 percent from a year
            earlier in the third quarter, dropped 1.8 percent in the fourth
            as industry and export weakness pushed Ukraine into its first
            recession since 2009, Goldman Sachs estimated in a Jan. 23 note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ukraine has seen its macroeconomic fundamentals
            deteriorate in the past year as a result of a sharp negative
            terms-of-trade shock, rising external government redemptions,
            and a worsening fiscal position,' Goldman Sachs wrote. 'The
            economy is now likely in a recession.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine is seeking international aid as its economy suffers
            from weaker demand for exports such as steel. An International
            Monetary Fund mission is due to arrive next week for talks on a
            third bailout since 2008 after foreign reserves fell to the
            lowest level in almost three years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Cohn Says He's Fairly Bullish on Global Equities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President Gary Cohn said he's 'fairly bullish' on global stock
            markets as investors will shift money from bonds to equities as interest rates rise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            cause of interest rates going up, which is greater economic activity and greater growth, will be very
            positive for our business,' Cohn said in an interview today with Bloomberg Television's Erik Schatzker at
            the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares in top companies also offer
            attractive dividend yields relative to where interest rates are, Cohn said. The dividend yield of the Dow
            Jones Industrial Average is 2.51 percent, compared with the 1.86 percent yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury
            bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I look at the dividend yield that you
            can receive in relatively blue-chip companies around the world, and I look at that versus risk-free yields,
            and I think that is an interesting opportunity,' Cohn said. 'You are long some global growth, you're long
            some inflation, and you get paid a decent return to own those.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohn contrasted his view
            on stocks with that on bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Fixed income on the other hand, interesting,' Cohn said.
            'At some point, interest rates will go higher again, and all of the money that has piled into fixed income
            over the past three years, some of it will come out.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Advise EBay as Icahn Intensifies Campaign</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is working
            for EBay Inc. (EBAY) as it faces calls from Carl Icahn to split off its
            PayPal unit, people with knowledge of the matter said, the
            investment bank's latest assignment with a technology company
            facing an activist investor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is a long-time adviser to EBay on a number of
            issues, Amanda Miller, spokeswoman for the online marketplace,
            said while declining to discuss the specifics of the bank's current
            role regarding Icahn's efforts. 'We did not engage them specifically
            for this matter,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank also has advised Apple (AAPL) Inc. and
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the people said, asking not to be identified
            discussing private information. Apple faces calls for a bigger
            stock buyback from Icahn, and Microsoft recently said it will
            allow ValueAct Capital Management LLC President Mason Morfit to
            join its board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment banks are building up practices that advise
            companies on how to deter and respond to activists, as the
            investors garner more money and institutional backing. Funds
            managed by activists have almost tripled over five years, to $93
            billion at the end of last year from about $32 billion in 2008,
            according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, the activist defense practice has been
            spearheaded by partner Bill Anderson, who joined the bank in
            2000. Anderson was previously an MA lawyer at Simpson Thacher
            Bartlett LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Engaging Activists &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Icahn informed EBay last week he had begun purchasing the
            online marketplace's shares and was nominating two directors to
            its board, the company said. Icahn called a separation of PayPal
            -- one of EBay's faster-growing businesses -- from the company a
            'no-brainer' in an interview on Bloomberg TV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
            comment, as did Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lately, companies have been more proactively engaging
            activists before their efforts become public. Icahn's demands
            for for the PayPal split were disclosed by the San Jose,
            California-based company in its quarterly earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe spoke with Icahn
            last week and said on a conference call the company should stay
            together, citing how the intertwined entity helps fund PayPal's
            expansion into areas such as mobile. The payments unit boosted
            sales 19 percent last quarter, outpacing 12 percent sales growth
            at EBay's marketplace unit, which faces stiff competition from
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Technology Targets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Icahn's EBay investment follows a string of actions by
            activists taking on Silicon Valley technology firms, especially
            as some of the companies' rapid growth rates slow. Icahn has
            this week tweeted that he increased his stake in Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He is proposing that the company commit to buying back at
            least $50 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2014, something that
            Apple is recomending investors vote against. Goldman Sachs
            advised Apple's board as it weighed an earlier push from
            Greenlight Capital Inc.'s David Einhorn to issue more preferred
            stock which would pay a higher dividend than common stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft signed a pact to cooperate with ValueAct in
            August, four months after the activist fund disclosed a stake of
            about $1.9 billion in the software maker and at the deadline for
            proxy contests ahead of a November annual meeting. ValueAct, the
            San Francisco-based firm headed by Jeffrey Ubben, has since
            increased its stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Microsoft said it would allow
            Morfit to join the board and hold regular meetings with Morfit,
            directors and select management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co., Juniper Networks
            Inc. and Riverbed Technology Inc. are also facing activist
            pressure. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has
            controls in place to avoid conflicts of interest when clients
            request jobs for their children, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I've had people who say, 'Look, my kid's in the blankety-blank business school in the United
            States, and really would
            like a job in finance, really would like a job at Goldman
            Sachs,'' Blankfein, 59, said today in a CNBC interview at the
            World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'I'm thinking about
            how it could look, and so we have a lot of processes to vet
            these things.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When asked if he had seen any hiring that appeared to be a
            bribe, Blankfein said, 'Not firsthand.' U.S. regulators are
            looking at hiring practices in China amid an investigation into
            JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein joined Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman in
            pointing out that many talented employees happen to be children
            of powerful leaders in China and in other parts of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you precluded yourself from hiring any kid that was
            affiliated with somebody or whose parent was an important
            official or important industrialist or executive, you wouldn't
            have very many people left,' Blankfein said. 'Who do you think
            the kids are that are multicultural and filling Harvard Business
            School?' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Blankfein Says Market Drop Would Be 'Normal'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;This week's decline in financial
            markets isn't surprising because the value of those assets has
            risen sharply during the past year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It would be very abnormal if we didn't have consolidating
            moves in the assets that have gone up so much,' Blankfein, 59,
            said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle at the World Economic
            Forum in
            Davos, Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI World Index fell 1.5 percent, the most since
            August, as of 11:18 a.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
            Average headed toward its biggest weekly drop since 2012 and the
            Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 2.1 percent today, the most since
            June. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 1.5 percent,
            extending its loss for the year to 5.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market is working through 'jitters' amid a repricing
            of emerging-market assets, Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn
            said in a separate interview. While the recent moves are 'not
            extraordinary,' investors should expect larger swings than in
            the past as banks that serve as market-makers pull back amid new
            restrictions and capital rules, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As we continue to regulate markets and continue to
            increase capital charges, you've seen all of the banks' reduce
            capital they commit to trading, Cohn said. 'We need to get used
            to seeing more and more moves like this. This is just a natural
            evolution of where markets are headed.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein is optimistic that the
            worst of the financial crisis is over, according to an interview
            with the British Broadcasting Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The moment of crisis is over,' Blankfein told the BBC.
            'I find a lot of things to be optimistic about, including the
            worst expected or worrisome problems that everyone talked about
            last year are off the table,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who became CEO in 2006, has overseen the New
            York-based firm's highest profits and biggest losses as a public
            company. He also warned about the potential for a credit crisis
            during a June 2007 conference, 15 months before the collapse of
            Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Problems related to the financial crisis have been chewed
            through,' he told the BBC. 'Net, net I'm optimistic. That is
            my predictive self.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein said the firm's deliberations over whether to
            defer the payment of incentive compensation due to U.K.
            employees until after the top rate of income tax drops April
            weren't linked to 'tax evasion or tax avoidance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs won't delay its distribution of U.K. bonuses
            to help minimize employees' tax rates, a person with direct
            knowledge of the decision said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;

            the New York-based firm paid him less. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, was granted $13.3 million in restricted
            stock for last year that comprises about 70 percent of his total
            bonus, a person with knowledge of the matter said last week. On
            that basis, the total bonus is about $19 million including $5.7
            million in cash, up from a $10 million stock-and-cash award for
            2011. Blankfein, who is also the bank's chairman, receives a $2
            million salary. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I've been in this firm for 30 years,' Blankfein said in
            the interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. 'Most of my
            interest in Goldman Sachs comes from trading in my partnership
            interest for stock. So I'm more of a shareholder than an
            employee.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A $21 million total compensation package would be
            Blankfein's highest since his $68.5 million record in 2007, when
            Goldman Sachs's earnings per share were 75 percent higher. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sells Its First Benchmark Bonds in Euros for 1 1/2 Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised 1
            billion euros ($1.3 billion) from its first benchmark sale in
            the currency for 1 1/2 years, just a week after issuing $6
            billion of debt in its biggest deal ever. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank sold 3.25 percent senior, unsecured 10-year
            notes that were priced to yield 155 basis points more than the
            swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal
            lifts total corporate bond sales in Europe this week to about 19
            billion euros, matching the previous week's volume. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is borrowing money as the European Central
            Bank said today that banks will hand back more of its three-year
            emergency loans than forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
            survey. That boosted investor confidence and helped send the
            cost of insuring bank debt down from near a four-week high. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's still strong demand for financial debt in
            Europe,' said Georg Grodzki, the head of credit research at
            Legal General Investment Management in London, which manages
            more than $600 billion of bonds. 'Yields may be heading up soon
            and fast if Goldman Sachs's own economic optimism proves
            correct' and interest rates rise, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Koji Wada, a Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) banker in Tokyo, was appointed head coach of the Keio
            University rugby team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wada, vice president and salesman in the fixed income,
            currency and commodity division, will start the role on Feb. 24,
            according to a statement released today by the Keio University
            rugby alumni association. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It hasn't been decided whether Wada, 34, will remain
            employed by Goldman Sachs, said Sumiko Iwadate, a spokeswoman
            for the U.S. bank in Tokyo. The Asahi newspaper reported his
            appointment earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wada joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001 after
            graduating from Keio, where he played rugby and helped the team
            win the university championship in the 1999-2000 season,
            according to the statement. Keio hasn't won it since then. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;College rugby matches in Japan, such as the annual fixture
            between Keio and Tokyo rival Waseda University, regularly draw
            thousands of fans. Masanori Mochida, head of Goldman Sachs's
            Japan unit, played fullback for Keio. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Distaste in Denmark Turns Dong Into Buy: Nordic Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Opposition to Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS)'s planned investment in Dong Energy A/S has opened up a bet
            on debt sold by the Danish power and oil producer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on the bonds climbed amid rising resistance to the 8
            billion kroner ($1.5 billion) investment, with a former prime
            minister saying that selling to the Wall Street firm is morally
            and financially wrong and jeopardizes Denmark's environmental
            agenda. The government is seeking to sell a stake to shore up
            the utility's finances after failed natural gas bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would use these recent small declines to buy the bonds
            as the debate is only white noise,' Jens H. Thomsen, a credit
            analyst at Jyske Bank A/S, said by phone. 'It's very likely
            that the deal goes through and that would be very positive for
            the credit profile.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Dong's 6.25 percent bond due 3013 rose to 5.78
            percent in Copenhagen at the end of last week, the highest since
            Nov. 7. It yielded 5.67 percent on Jan. 9 before the criticism
            intensified over New York-based Goldman's investment. That was
            the lowest yield since the note started trading on June 24,
            according to Composite Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. Today, the
            yield fell to 5.77 percent, the first decline in seven trading
            days. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Matsui Sees Japan's Economic Policy Stable This Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese leaders are unlikely to
            roll out major new economic policies to boost growth this year,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials who fought deflation last year through measures
            including quantitative easing, monetary stimulus and increased
            government spending will opt for policy stability, said Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at the New
            York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This year, I don't think you are going to get major
            bazooka-type policy announcements,' Matsui said in an interview
            to Bloomberg Radio today. 'I think it is more a question of
            looking for the fundamental improvement both in the macro
            economy and corporate level.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan has pledged to forge ahead with structural reforms
            designed to open business opportunities in industries from
            health care to agriculture as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe leads
            efforts to break the legacy of 15 years of deflation. The
            administration's attempts helped propel Japan's Topix index of
            shares up 51 percent last year, its best performance since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abe's stimulus program caused an 18 percent weakening in
            the yen against the dollar last year, helping exporters. The
            Japanese currency fell 0.1 percent to 102.79 per greenback as of
            9:45 p.m. in Tokyo today, while the benchmark 10-year yield was
            at 0.63 percent compared with 0.745 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matsui said the depreciation in yen is not completely
            beneficial to Japan as it increased the cost of growing fossil-fuel imports in the wake of nuclear-plant
            shutdowns. Japan
            reported a record annual trade deficit for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The weaker the yen becomes the more expensive that fuel
            becomes, so it is not a unanimous positive for everybody,' she
            said. 'Therefore, I think the currency at this kind of level
            anywhere from 100 or around 100 yen to a dollar is actually not
            too bad for most companies be they exporters or importers.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Russia Hires Goldman to Boost Investor Image Abroad</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to boost its image abroad as the most corrupt country
            among the Group of 20 last year seeks to attract foreign investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Economy Ministry
            and the Russian Direct Investment Fund have signed a memorandum with Goldman under which the New York-based
            bank will advise on issues such as communicating government decisions, according to Deputy Economy Minister
            Sergei Belyakov. State-owned banks including OAO Sberbank (SBER) and VTB Group will also assist, he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We don't know how to communicate with investors,' Belyakov told reporters today in
            Moscow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin last year ordered the government to improve Russia's
            standing in the World Bank's Doing Business rating to 20th by 2018. It climbed eight positions to 112 in the
            latest study, issued in October. While that's better than BRIC peers India and Brazil, Russia is still the
            worst among major economies in terms of graft, Transparency International said last month in its annual
            Corruption Perceptions Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's largest energy exporter plans to raise a
            record $10 billion from asset sales this year, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in an
            interview with Bloomberg Television this month. While corruption continues to be an issue, it's less of an
            issue for foreign investors who have already committed to Russia, Shuvalov said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stocks,
            Ruble &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Russia's benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) has gained 6 percent this year, beating
            the MSCI's Emerging Markets Index's 0.7 percent advance. The ruble-denominated equity gauge was little
            changed at 1,563.37 by the close of trade in Moscow. The ruble, which has gained 1.3 percent against the
            dollar in 2013, fell 0.5 percent to 30.1920. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A working group will draw up a list of
            measures to bolster Russia's image next month, according to Belyakov. The group will include Economy
            Ministry, Goldman and state bank representatives, as well as Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and central
            bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The death in custody in 2009 of Sergei
            Magnitsky, a lawyer for Hermitage Capital Management Ltd. who accused officials of embezzling $230 million,
            is a symbol of Russia's failure to tackle corruption, according to Christopher Granville, managing director
            of Trusted Sources, a London-based emerging-markets research group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax Charges &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magnitsky and Hermitage head William Browder are being tried in absentia on tax-evasion charges.
            Browder, who denies wrongdoing, has lobbied for U.S. and European legislation targeting Russian officials
            who he says are responsible for Magnitsky's death with visa bans and asset freezes. Hermitage was once
            Russia's biggest foreign equity investor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'To say that Russia is equal only to this
            tragedy is not quite right,' Belyakov said, referring to Magnitsky's death. 'To some degree the work that we
            announced today is to ensure that all our actions won't be annulled by statements like those from Browder.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. in December imposed a visa ban and asset freeze on Russian officials implicated
            in Magnitsky's death. In retaliation, Russia banned the adoption of Russian children in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland,
            that Magnitsky's death has been 'politicized' by investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sold Largest Apple-Tied Note in 11 Months Before Results</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $29.9 million of six-month structured notes tied to Apple Inc.
            (AAPL) the day before the company announced earnings that sent its stock plunging 12 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued Jan. 22, yield 10 percent a year, plus any gains of the stock up to 11.25
            percent, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If Apple drops,
            the notes -- which were sold at a face value about the same as a share of the Cupertino, California-based
            company -- decline at the same rate, providing no protection against losses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notes
            are Goldman Sachs's largest offering tied to the company since Feb. 24, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Structured notes, which are bank debt packaged with derivatives, allow individual investors to
            take bets on everything from the price of gold to movements in stock volatility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiffany
            Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the offering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related
            story: A Devil's Bargain Faces Investors in Popular Structured Notes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notes tied to single
            stocks or indexes tend to limit the amount that investors can lose by including so-called barriers or
            principal protection, Bloomberg data show. Goldman sold $14 million of automatically callable three-year
            notes tied to the iPad maker on Jan. 4, the second-largest Apple note this month, that yield 9.2 percent a
            year and shield investor capital as long as the stock doesn't fall more than 30 percent, according to a
            prospectus filed with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple shares tumbled on Jan. 24 after the company posted
            the slowest profit growth since 2003 and the smallest sales increase in 14 quarters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Popular
            Reference &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, investors bought $1.75 billion of structured notes tied to Apple,
            making it the second-most popular reference measure after the Standard Poor's 500 Index, Bloomberg data
            show. Notes linked to Apple surpassed those tied to the London interbank offered rate for the first time
            since at least 2010, when Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on the securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors
            have bought $65.6 million of Apple-linked notes in January. On the day before the earnings report, HSBC
            Holdings Plc's U.S. banking unit also sold $710,000 of notes tied to the company, and UBS AG issued $120,000
            of securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Structured notes offer customized bets to retail investors while banks
            earn fees and raise money from selling the products. Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from
            stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies, or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Siemens AG (SIE) has chosen Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) to advise on the sale of its water technologies unit,
            Reuters reported, citing two people familiar with matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The sale may officially begin in the second quarter, the
            news agency said, citing the sources. Siemens announced plans to
            dispose of the water unit, which has annual sales of about 1
            billion euros ($1.35 billion), in November. Siemens and Goldman
            Sachs declined to comment, Reuters said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several potential bidders have approached Munich-based
            Siemens, according to the news agency. It said industry sources
            expect Xylem Inc. (XYL) and Pentair Ltd. (PNR) to be interested as much of
            Siemens's water business is focused on North America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asian suitors may include Kurita Water Industries Ltd. (6370),

            cited said. Private equity buyers are also expected to show

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A measure of U.S. corporate credit
            risk dropped the most in seven weeks as data showed consumer
            confidence firming and emerging market stocks snapped three days
            of losses. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $3.2 billion of bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
            to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 2.7 basis points to
            69.9 basis points at 4:21 p.m. in New York, according to prices
            compiled by Bloomberg. The measure fell the most since Dec. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors pushed the gauge lower as emerging markets rose
            and the Conference Board's index of U.S. consumer confidence
            climbed to 80.7 in January from a revised 77.5 the prior month,
            according to the private research group. An increase in consumer
            activity would bolster companies' ability to repay debts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's an overall improved tone in the global markets with
            emerging markets doing much better today than they have in the
            last three sessions,' Adrian Miller, director of fixed-income
            strategies at GMP Securities LLC in New York, said in a
            telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emerging-market equities advanced as a surprise rate
            increase in India bolstered bets central banks will shore up
            their currencies. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index added 0.3
            percent to 934.81 at 4:11 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Apple Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The credit swaps measure typically falls as investor
            confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
            pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
            obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
            equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
            debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost to protect the debt of Apple Inc. (AAPL) for five years
            jumped 9 basis points to 35 basis points as of 3:18 p.m. in New
            York, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw
            Hill Financial Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
            privately negotiated market. That's the biggest rise since Nov.
            25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple reported iPhone sales for the holiday season that
            missed analysts' estimates. For its fiscal first quarter ended
            Dec. 28, Apple said it sold a record 51 million iPhones, below
            analysts' forecast of 54.7 million handsets. The company also
            projected revenue in the current period may fall from a year
            earlier, in what would be the first quarterly sales decline
            since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Offering &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs issued $2.5 billion of 2.625 percent, five-year notes to yield 112.5 basis points
            more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            The securities may be rated Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service,
            the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank with the highest return on equity also
            sold $700 million of additional securities to its existing $1
            billion of 1.34 percent floating-rate notes that come due in
            November 2018. The debt pays 110 basis points more than the
            three-month London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds of Goldman Sachs were the most actively traded
            dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today,
            accounting for 5.3 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1
            million or more as of 4:47 p.m. in New York, according to Trace,
            the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
            Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Distress Ratio &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. distress ratio decreased to 5.2 percent in January
            from 5.3 percent in December, analysts led by Diane Vazza at
            Standard Poor's said in a statement. The ratio has remained
            within the 5 percent to 6 percent range over the past 10 months,
            which is close to its 2004-2006 average of 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP's ratio is the number of distressed securities divided
            by the total number of speculative-grade issues. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
            Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
            companies, narrowed 12.2 basis points to 337.4, Bloomberg prices
            show. Junk or high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody's
            and less than BBB- at SP. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
            point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to hold investment-grade
            corporate bonds rather than government debt was little changed
            at 111.8, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Drives Up Dong Valuation as Investor Predicts Bigger IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s presence in Dong Energy A/S will boost the value of the Danish
            utility and make a listing more likely, a minority owner said, defending the Wall Street bank amid a wave of
            opposition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denmark's finance committee decides tomorrow whether Goldman can invest 8
            billion kroner ($1.5 billion) in exchange for an 18 percent stake in Dong, which needs fresh equity after
            losing money on failed natural gas bets. Finance Minister Bjarne Corydon has said Denmark must back the deal
            to avoid 'gambling' with Dong's future after some lawmakers questioned the bid and a former prime minister
            called Goldman a 'shady partner.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We want to buy shares to defend our stake in Dong if
            the finance committee approves the agreement with Goldman, ATP and PFA,' Gert Vinther Joergensen, chief
            financial officer of Syd Energi A/S, said by phone. 'The deal makes an initial public offering more likely
            and increases the value of our shares.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government pulled a planned IPO of Dong in
            2008 as the financial crisis dragged down stock markets across the globe. Dong said Oct. 2 that the new
            buyers and the government have agreed to seek an IPO when 'conditions are right.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Syd
            Energi, a power company based in Esbjerg, has said it will invest 450 million kroner in connection with
            Goldman's injection to maintain its current 3.5 percent stake in Dong. Goldman is making its investment via
            its European merchant banking unit and in partnership with Denmark's two largest pension funds, ATP and PFA,
            which will own 4.9 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sees Rate Cut as ECB Best Option on Money Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A rate cut is the European Central
            Bank's best option to respond to rising borrowing costs in euro-area money markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overnight interbank rates were above the central bank's
            benchmark interest rate this month for the longest stretch since
            2011. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Jan. 9 that officials
            are ready to 'act as needed' in response to 'unwarranted
            tightening of the short-term money markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is only a matter of time before the ECB will have to
            address the issue,' Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman
            Sachs in Frankfurt, said in the e-mailed note. A cut in the key
            rate 'seems in principle the best option if the ECB wants to
            guarantee short-term money market rates close to zero.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy makers gathering in Frankfurt on Feb. 6 for their
            monthly rate-setting meeting have to assess whether the tighter
            financing conditions show a resurgence of tensions that justify
            a policy response or simply increased confidence in the region's
            economic recovery. The bank cut its benchmark rate to a record-low 0.25 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The overnight unsecured lending rate for banks in euros was
            above that level for the four days through Jan. 21 and climbed
            as high as 0.359 percent on Jan. 20. It fell for a fifth day
            yesterday, declining to 0.188 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Liquidity Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Excess liquidity in the euro area, the surplus cash in the
            financial system that isn't immediately needed by banks to meet
            their obligations, was at 170.3 billion euros ($232.3 billion)
            yesterday after dropping last week to 125.5 billion euros, the
            least since December 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ECB failed for a second week to sterilize government
            bond purchases conducted under the now-terminated Securities
            Markets Program. That may be a signal that banks are reluctant
            to part with liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank's key rate will fall to 0.1 percent and
            the deposit rate, which is currently at zero, to minus 0.1
            percent by March, according to Barclays Plc and Commerzbank AG
            in reports this month. Royal Bank of Canada said the main rate
            will be reduced while the deposit rate stays at zero. Alessandro
            Giansanti, a rates strategist at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam, said
            the benchmark will be cut within three months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schumacher said that while the ECB will probably keep rates
            unchanged at the February meeting, an eventual cut in the
            benchmark rate to 0.1 percent would be the 'most effective'
            measure. He said that one 'negative side-effect' of a
            reduction may be that a narrowing of spreads between official
            rates could curb the incentive of banks to lend to each other. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Rates Salesman Shea Retires After 27 Years</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Kevin Shea, an interest-rate
            salesman at Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. who has worked at the firm
            for 27 years, is retiring, according to a person briefed on the
            decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shea, 48, is leaving as of this month, said the person, who
            asked to remain anonymous because the decision hadn't been made
            public. He joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 1987 and was
            named managing director in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shea worked for 12 years as a trader on the bank's U.S.
            government debt desk before moving to London as part of the
            fixed-income sales group, according to a biography on the
            website of Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, where
            Shea earned a bachelor's degree in economics and English in
            1987. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He returned to Goldman Sachs's New York office in 2003,
            joining the interest-rate product sales team covering
            institutions and macro hedge funds, according to the website. He
            also serves on the town council for Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shea declined to comment when reached at his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interest-rates trading units on Wall Street suffered as the
            Federal Reserve decided whether to taper its stimulus efforts.
            Rates trading revenue at the 10 largest global investment banks
            dropped 40 percent to $14.5 billion in the first nine months of
            2013, according to industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interest-rates trading involves buying and selling products
            including U.S. Treasury notes and bonds, other government debt,
            inflation-linked securities and interest-rate derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Chavez's 681% Returns Mean Socialism Buoys Goldman: Andes Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Since taking office in 1999, Hugo Chavez has spread his socialist revolution in Venezuela by
            seizing more than 1,000 companies. For bondholders that stuck by
            him, he's also delivered returns that are double the emerging-
            market average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 681 percent advance, equal to 14.7 percent annually,
            has enriched investors from OppenheimerFunds Inc. to Goldman
            Sachs Asset Management LP that counted on Chavez's willingness
            to siphon the country's oil wealth to pay its creditors in the
            face of start-stop growth and falling reserves. While his
            policies drove away enough investors to keep Venezuela's
            borrowing costs over 12 percent on average during his tenure, or
            4 percentage points higher than those of developing nations,
            he's never missed a bond payment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a really great high-income and high-total-return
            investment for your portfolio,' said Sara Zervos, an emerging-
            market debt manager at New York-based OppenheimerFunds, which
            oversees $176 billion in assets and has invested in Venezuelan
            notes for more than a decade. 'Chavez hasn't done a lot of good
            for his country, but he has the objective to service the bonds.
            Our interests are aligned.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now, as the 58-year-old leader battles cancer, the nation's
            outsized returns may be nearing an end. While Venezuela's
            benchmark bonds have climbed to a five-year high since Chavez
            said on Dec. 8 that he needed more surgery, they're unlikely to
            replicate the gains they've posted in the past decade once the
            rally drives yields down closer in line with regional peers,
            according to Russell Dallen, the head trader at Caracas Capital
            Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Missed Inauguration &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chavez's deteriorating health has triggered a 41 percent
            bond gain in the past year on speculation that a new regime will
            retreat from policies that curtailed oil production in the
            country that holds the world's largest reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chavez missed the inauguration for his third six-year term
            on Jan. 10 as he recovered from surgery to treat an undisclosed
            type of cancer. Information Minister Ernesto Villegas told
            reporters on Jan. 27 that the president is healthy enough to
            make economic policy decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A former paratrooper and an ally of former Cuban President
            Fidel Castro, Chavez has nationalized farms and energy
            companies, imposed price caps on products such as toothpaste and
            toilet paper and championed companies where workers participate
            in decision-making. He has devalued the bolivar four times since
            imposing currency controls in 2003, shut down more than 50
            foreign-exchange brokerages in 2010 and threatened to jail
            people who trade in the black market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Oil Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The policies have led to shortages of everything from
            electricity to sugar and beef, fueled the world's third-highest
            inflation rate and inflated Venezuelan bond yields. That's
            rewarded investors willing to buy the debt at discounted prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interest-rate payments on Venezuelan bonds exceeded price
            gains by 1.4 times since 1999, versus 0.3 for Brazilian bonds
            and 1.09 for Mexican securities, according to data compiled by
            Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chavez has made good on debt payments as crude oil prices
            surged to $97 a barrel from $12 in 1998. The government will
            earn about $81 billion from oil exports this year, almost 10
            times the amount of interest-rate payments and debt redemptions
            from the government and state-owned oil company Petroleos de
            Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, according to Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At 22 percent of gross domestic product, Venezuela's net
            government debt is lower than the median level of 36 percent
            among similar-rated countries, according to Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'More Fragile' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While the story has been deteriorating, Venezuela will
            continue to pay their debt,' Sam Finkelstein, an emerging-
            market bond manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in New
            York, said in a telephone interview on Jan. 25. 'The situation
            will have to be much tighter, more fragile for a default to be
            likely.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finkelstein has been an investor in Venezuelan bonds over
            the past 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Venezuelan bonds accounted for about 6.7 percent of the
            holdings of Goldman Sachs's $2.9 billion Growth Emerging
            Markets Debt Fund (GSEMKDP), the third-biggest investment, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund returned 12.8 percent over
            the past three years, outperforming 90 percent of its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While calling debt the tool used by the U.S. 'empire' to
            exploit Venezuela, Chavez honored his obligations even after a
            three-month nationwide strike in 2003 all but shut down the
            country's oil industry and caused the economy to shrink 7.6
            percent that year. He made an interest payment on a bond that is
            tied to oil prices in 2005 after a four-month delay prompted SP
            to temporally downgrade Venezuela's credit rating to selective
            default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Makes Noise' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chavez paid off the debt because non-payment would lead
            creditors to seize Venezuelan oil shipments, which supply half
            of the government's revenue, according to Simon Nocera, a former
            economist at the International Monetary Fund. Bond investors can
            also freeze Venezuelan assets overseas, including refineries and
            gas stations of Citgo Petroleum Corp., a subsidiary of PDVSA, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chavez makes noise, but he will never come out and say:
            'We are going to restructure our bonds,'' Nocera, now chief
            investment officer at Lumen Advisors LLC, said in a telephone
            interview from San Francisco on Jan. 23. 'He knows if he does,
            he won't sell the only product that allows him to survive.
            There's no reason to be scared.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry declined to comment on the country's
            bond performance in an e-mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have had to endure swings in the value of
            Venezuela's bonds to reap their gains. Their yield relative to
            Treasuries touched an all-time low of 163 basis points, or 1.63
            percentage points, in May 2006, before spiking to 1,887 in
            December 2008. Investors demand an extra yield of 722 basis
            points to hold Venezuelan bonds instead of Treasuries yesterday,
            versus 319 basis points for Sri Lanka and 307 for Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the average yields on Venezuelan bonds have fallen to
            the lowest since January 2008, their current 9.04 percent level
            is still double the emerging-market average of 4.49 percent,
            according to JPMorgan Chase Co. At 605 basis points yesterday,
            the country's five-year credit-default swaps suggest a 35
            percent chance that Venezuela will default by 2018, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The spreads reflect the risk existing in the Venezuelan
            economy, and the perception of that risk is real,' Francisco Rodriguez-Caballero, an economist at Bank of
            America, said in a
            telephone interview on Jan. 23. 'You are always happy when you
            win, but that doesn't mean it's a bet that you should feel
            comfortable making.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Zambia Levels &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Venezuela's credit rating of B+ at SP is four levels below
            investment grade and on a par with those of Zambia and Sri
            Lanka. Brazil, which was ranked the same as Venezuela 14 years
            ago, has been upgraded five steps to BBB. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Finkelstein said he still holds a
            'modest' overweight position in Venezuelan bonds as the
            economy is likely to improve after Chavez relinquishes power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuela bonds
            instead of Treasuries will narrow to about 500 basis points
            should the opposition win presidential elections in the post-
            Chavez era, leaving them at levels similar to those of Ukraine,
            he said. Venezuelan bonds traded at a spread of 722 basis points
            over Treasuries at 10:29 a.m. in New York, according to
            JPMorgan's EMBI Global index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Significant Cushion' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The constitution states that elections must be held within
            30 days should Chavez step down or die. Vice President Nicolas Maduro, a Chavez ally, is running the
            government in his absence.
            Henrique Capriles Radonski, who lost to Chavez in October, leads
            the opposition party Primero Justicia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors are expecting a regime change,' Finkelstein
            said. 'The new government will be more pragmatic and less
            idealist, and bondholders can benefit.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike Venezuela, other Latin American countries including
            Brazil, Panama and Peru rewarded bondholders with gains fueled
            by economic growth, slowing inflation and surging foreign
            reserves. Brazilian bonds returned 662 percent during the past
            14 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rally has squeezed most of the gains out of Brazilian
            bonds, leaving Venezuelan securities as a more attractive
            option, according to Oppenheimer's Zervos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For Brazil, we just don't think there's a lot of
            upside,' Zervos said. 'Chavez squandered a lot of money, but
            there's still significant cushion and the ability to pay is
            still there. The spreads can definitely compress more.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Gold to Corn Losses After 2013 Bear Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks led by Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. and Citigroup Inc. say commodities are heading for losses
            in 2014 as rising supplies and slowing demand compound slumps
            that led to bear markets last year in gold, copper and corn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Open interest measuring holdings across the 24 commodities
            tracked by the Standard Poor's GSCI Spot Index (BUSY) fell for three
            straight quarters through December, the longest slump since the
            global recession in 2008. The super cycle that led commodities
            to almost quadruple since 2001 is reversing, with prices set to
            drop 3 percent in 12 months, Goldman said. The asset class will
            be a 'wallflower' compared with equities, Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw materials from copper and corn to sugar and coffee will
            be in surplus this year after a decade-long bull market spurred
            producers to build new mines, drill more wells and expand
            planting of crops. Investors pulled a record $43.3 billion last
            year from commodity funds tracked by EPFR Global, and hedge
            funds cut bullish bets across 18 U.S. futures by 53 percent from
            an all-time high in September 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Supply growth is still formidable across most
            commodities,' said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior
            investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which
            oversees $115 billion. 'It will take some time for actual
            demand trends to start to overwhelm that increasing supply.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI dropped 0.8 percent this month and 2.2 percent
            last year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
            slid 3.5 percent, after surging 20 percent in 2013. The
            Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading
            partners, has climbed 1.1 percent since the end of December. The
            Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index advanced 1.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lagging Equities &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, which measures
            investor returns after some rolling positions are taken into
            account, will drop 3 percent in the next 12 months, Goldman said
            in a Jan. 12 report. Precious metals will lose 15 percent, while
            agriculture will decline 11 percent, the bank said. Industrial
            metals will decrease 5 percent, livestock 3 percent, and energy
            will fall 1 percent, Jeffrey Currie, the bank's head of
            commodities research, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are still at below-trend GDP growth, and typically in
            this environment you see weak commodity returns and low
            volatility,' Currie said by e-mail Jan. 22. 'The expectations
            are the U.S. grows near trend, but Europe won't, and the
            emerging markets won't. If the growth was above trend
            everywhere, we'd be jumping into commodities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the 18 euro-area nations emerged from the longest
            recession since they began using the currency 15 years ago,
            economic growth this year will be just 1 percent, below the
            annual average of 1.5 percent since 1997, according to 56
            economists in a Bloomberg survey. China, the top user of
            everything from zinc to cotton, will expand 7.5 percent, the
            slowest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI gauge surged 170 percent from the end of 1999
            to Dec. 31, 2009, the most of any decade since the data begins
            in 1971. Higher commodity prices encouraged investment in new
            production technology and expanded development of farms, oil
            reserves and mines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global refined-copper output this year will jump to 22.2
            million metric tons, or 55 percent more than in 1999, according
            to New York-based researcher CPM Group. Last year's record corn
            harvest of 13.925 billion bushels in the U.S., the world's
            largest grower and exporter, was 48 percent bigger than the
            harvest 15 years earlier, government data show. World crude-oil
            output has expanded by 19 percent since 1999, according to the
            U.S. Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Back Seat' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI lagged behind the MSCI equity index for two
            straight years, the first time that's occurred since 1998.
            Commodities will continue to take a 'back seat' to other
            assets because raw-material gains from 2009 to 2011 were 'built
            on unsustainable factors,' Citigroup analysts including Jon Bergtheil and David Wilson said in a Jan. 6
            report. Metals have
            'little encouragement' from the balance of supply and demand
            this year, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'super cycle' has ended because supply has caught up
            with demand, Citigroup said in November 2012. A year later,
            analysts led by Ed Morse said the bank 'remains neutral to
            bearish commodities' with muted demand expected in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Producers expanded output, after tight supplies led to a
            tripling of the SP GSCI since the end of 1999, with record
            prices for commodities including oil, gold and copper. More
            supply led to a divergence of commodity and equity markets that
            had rallied together since the recession, Goldman's Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bullish Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. says commodity bears are 'overly
            confident on the reliability of supply' and underestimate
            demand. All but eight of the 65 commodity indices the bank
            tracks will gain over the next two years, with five of them
            posting double-digit annual returns, analysts led by Colin Fenton wrote in a Dec. 30 report. The 'super
            cycle' is 'just
            beyond its midpoint,' and the markets are still in the 'bull
            phases,' JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund raised this year's global
            growth forecast to 3.7 percent, from an October estimate of 3.6
            percent. The jobless rate in the U.S. fell to a five-year low
            last month, and Euro-area factory output grew faster than
            economists forecast in January, according to Markit Economics.
            The U.S. is the top consumer of corn and crude oil. Europe
            accounts for about 18 percent of copper demand and 14 percent of
            global energy use, Barclays and BP Plc data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Caterpillar Inc., the largest maker of mining and
            construction equipment, sees global growth this year at 3
            percent, up from 2 percent in 2013, the Peoria, Illinois-based
            company said in a Jan. 27 statement. That will boost demand for
            mined commodities and energy, keeping most prices high enough
            'to make investments attractive,' the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Demand Continues &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Even if we don't see a sharp rebound in China, emerging
            markets in general, they are still growing, and that economic
            growth would bode well for continued demand for food,' said
            Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio manager who helps manage
            about $4.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.
            'As the population becomes more affluent, even in slower
            growth, diets continue to improve, and demand for higher volumes
            of food and better quality, that should continue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold and silver, after plunging last year by the most since
            1981, should see 'a decent rebound coming' as mines cut back
            on output, Sorrentino said. 'It's just purely based on physical
            volumes.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bearish Bets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other large speculators have reduced their
            net-long holdings to 735,217 futures and options across 18 U.S.-
            traded commodities as of Jan. 21, compared to the all-time high
            of 1.56 million, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
            show. Only eight of the 139 funds, including ETFs, in the Lipper
            Global Commodity group made money last year, according to fund
            data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There are 'shades of bearishness' across commodities,
            Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Jan. 17 report. The stronger
            dollar in 2014 will be a 'major problem,' Julien Garran, a
            London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a Jan. 20 report. Supply
            growth also puts prices 'at risk,' Deutsche Bank said in a
            Jan. 14 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should stay underweight agriculture, gold and
            silver this year, Societe Generale SA said in a Jan. 10 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude oil will drop 8.1 percent to
            $90 a barrel in 12 months, Goldman forecasts. The U.S. is
            extracting the most oil since 1989 as producers tap shale-rock
            formations, cutting costs for refiners and driving fuel prices
            at the pump down 9.8 percent since March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Total domestic petroleum consumption averaged 18.8 million
            barrels a day in the four weeks ended Jan. 17, the lowest since
            Oct. 18., government data show. Global output will rise faster
            than demand this year and next, the EIA estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Precious Metals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For gold investors, there's 'more pain to come' after
            prices tumbled 28 percent last year, the most since 1981, Morgan
            Stanley analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a
            report Jan. 22. The bank cut its 2014 target 12 percent to
            $1,160 an ounce. Goldman sees prices at $1,050 in the next 12
            months. Investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
            amid a rally in equities and muted inflation. Holdings through
            exchange-traded products fell 33 percent in the past year,
            erasing $68.8 billion from the value of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copper prices will slump 13 percent to $6,200 a metric ton,
            Goldman projects. Supplies will top demand by 385,000 tons this
            year, up from a surplus of 45,000 tons in 2013, the bank said in
            a Jan. 21 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Agriculture Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Agricultural Index of eight crops fell 22
            percent last year, the biggest slump since 1981, as record
            harvests from India to the U.S. expanded supplies. Corn futures
            have tumbled 50 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in August
            2012. Worldwide wheat output will be at an all-time high for the
            fourth time in six years, U.S. government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global food costs tracked by the United Nations dropped 14
            percent from an all-time high in February 2011. J.M. Smucker
            Co., the Orrville, Ohio-based maker of Folgers coffee, is
            passing along savings from the lower cost of beans via
            promotions, Chief Executive Officer Richard Smucker said on a
            Nov. 20 earnings conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cost inflation peaked in the six months through Nov. 24 at
            General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios cereal, and the rate
            will 'ease in the second half' of the fiscal year that ends
            May 31, Chief Executive Officer Kendall J. Powell said on an
            earnings call Dec. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's adequate inventories in grains and in copper,'
            said Donald Selkin, who helps manage about $3 billion of assets
            as chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New
            York. 'Crude-oil inventories are going to return to excess once
            cold weather is done. Commodities should drift lower in an
            overall sense, absolutely.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Patria Bet on Brazil Telecom Building Boom</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. and Patria
            Investimentos SA are poised to benefit from a telecommunications
            building boom in Brazil as mobile-phone providers need companies
            to construct towers costing $320 million to $820 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, Patria and at least six other private-equity firms
            are backing five local tower builders as phone operators from
            Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) to Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4) shift from
            constructing their own towers to contracting the work out.
            Operators will seek bids to build about 3,900 towers, more than
            half the 6,680 new towers needed in 2014 to improve networks,
            according to forecasts from one of the builders, who asked not
            to be identified because the estimates aren't public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil is trying to boost services and reduce dropped calls
            as surging demand for high-speed Internet strains the current
            network. The country has about 61,000 towers installed today --
            slightly more than in the U.K., which is 1/20th the size and has
            a third of the population, said Chahram Zolfaghari, chief
            executive officer of builder Brazil Tower Co., the builder
            that's backed by investment firm 1848 Capital Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not talking about 10 percent or 20 percent growth -
            - it's like 100 percent,' Zolfaghari said in an interview at
            Bloomberg's Sao Paulo office about the number of towers needed
            in Brazil. 'They need to be doubled to properly attend to
            current needs.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Blackstone, Fishman &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the Brazilian
            hedge-fund firm founded by former central bank president Arminio Fraga, last year unveiled tower-investment
            fund Cell Site
            Solutions, while Patria Investimentos SA, a firm that includes
            Blackstone Group LP (BX) among its investors, has allocated 300
            million reais ($123 million) of capital to its Highline do
            Brasil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other companies planning to build towers in Brazil are T4U
            Tower Management, which is backed by Israel's Fishman Group; QMC
            Telecom International Holdings, whose investors include Peterson
            Partners LP and Housatonic Partners; and Brazil Tower. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An outside spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
            behalf of the company, as did an outside spokesman for Patria.
            Representatives from Peterson, Fishman and QMC didn't respond to
            requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More Brazilians are buying smartphones, while providers
            like Telefonica's Vivo brand and America Movil SAB (AMX)'s Claro unit
            are pushing data services to boost revenue, according to the
            companies' financial reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Crackdown &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tim was among the companies forced by regulatory agency
            Anatel to stop selling new lines for about 10 days in 2012 to
            address complaints about dropped calls. The crackdown, along
            with millions of reais in fines in the past several years, is
            putting pressure on companies to improve customer satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vivo needs 10,000 new towers in the next two years to meet
            traffic growth and government quality mandates, Chief Executive
            Officer Antonio Carlos Valente said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are starting to feel difficulties in the availability
            of steel and labor,' Valente said about challenges in building
            new towers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anatel doesn't regulate the tower market and sees demand
            increasing significantly in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a good business for tower builders,' said Anatel
            Superintendent Carlos Baigorri. 'Third-party tower builders
            will allow operators to focus on their core business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of the 6,680 new sites needed in Brazil, about 2,780 will
            be towers built by the operators themselves or shared towers in
            which companies install equipment alongside competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Profitable Sites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil Tower builds towers for 200,000 reais to 500,000
            reais apiece, its CEO says. That values the 3,900 to be built by
            third parties at 780 million to 2 billion reais, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil Tower then expects to sell
            the sites in bulk for as much as $300,000 each, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tower operating companies including SBA Communications
            Corp. (SBAC) and American Tower Corp. (AMT) have been expanding in the past
            two years as wireless providers prefer to lease towers rather
            than maintain them internally to preserve cash and limit
            investments. SBA agreed last month to pay 1.53 billion reais for
            2,007 Oi towers, or about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than
            twice the rate it paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi
            towers, according to Wells Fargo Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a long-term view of the market,' Kurt Bagwell,
            SBA's international president, said in a phone interview. 'We
            basically try to predict the growth of the revenue of these
            sites over time and we feel that the price we paid for these
            works for our business, no problem.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SBA rose 1.9 percent to $92.29 at the close in New York,
            while American Tower rose 2 percent to $81.18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Open Door &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cell Site, Brazil Tower, Highline do Brasil, T4U and QMC --
            the five largest builders in Brazil -- have the capacity to
            construct only as many as 1,600 towers a year, opening the door
            for other companies to step in to help build towers, according
            to the investor analysis obtained by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Everybody wants to do business in Brazil -- the problem
            is that to do business in Brazil is so difficult,' Brazil
            Tower's Zolfaghari said. 'Just in the state of Florida, you
            have 60 companies like us. Why do you think I'm in Brazil? Over
            there I would be one guy among hundreds.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pandora Hits Record High as Goldman Says Shares May Double</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora Media Inc. (P), the online radio
            service, rose to a record high after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            projected the stock has the potential to more than double in the
            next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora climbed 11 percent to $36.53 at the close in New
            York, its highest price since it sold shares in June 2011. The
            stock almost tripled in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares may top $60 in the next year if Pandora doubles
            advertising, increases its mix of local commercials to half of
            all ads and leverages fixed content costs, Heath Terry, an
            analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The next two years are critical for the development of
            Pandora's long-term revenue trajectory and royalty rates,'
            wrote Terry, who has a buy rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pandora is chasing the $15 billion spent each year in the
            U.S. on local radio advertising by opening sales offices in the
            biggest cities. The Oakland, California-based company is seeking
            to make its share of U.S. radio ads more closely match its share
            of radio listening, which was more than 8 percent last month.
            Pandora has said it runs less than 1 percent of U.S. radio ads. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Boost CEO's Bonus 11% to $21 Million</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, the highest-paid head of a
            U.S. bank for 2012, saw his bonus increase 11 percent to $21
            million for his work last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who also serves as chairman, received 88,422
            restricted shares on Jan. 28 valued at $14.7 million, according
            to a regulatory filing. He also got a cash award amounting to
            the typical 30 percent of his total bonus, according to a person
            with knowledge of the payout. On that basis, the cash portion of
            his bonus would be about $6.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) boosted stock
            awards for their CEOs this month after an improving U.S. economy
            drove up bank shares in 2013. Goldman Sachs had an 11 percent
            return on equity last year, topping its largest Wall Street
            rivals, while cutting pay costs amid revenue that was little
            changed. The stock jumped 39 percent in the year, more than the
            33 percent climb in the SP 500 Financials Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's bonus and $2 million salary amount to $3
            million more than what JPMorgan paid CEO Jamie Dimon. It was the
            second straight year that Blankfein out-earned his rival.
            Blankfein also got a $5 million long-term incentive a year ago
            tied to performance targets. Details of any 2014 long-term
            incentive will be disclosed later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Made $350 Million on 'Worthless' Trades, Libya Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made about
            $350 million on 'worthless' derivatives trades after exerting
            'undue influence' on managers of the Libyan Investment
            Authority, according to the sovereign-wealth fund, the second-largest in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LIA sued Goldman Sachs on Jan. 21 in London over
            investments of about $1 billion made in 2008. The fund said in
            court documents released today that its executives, who were
            given gifts of chocolate and after-shave by the bank, never
            understood the transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The unique circumstances allowed Goldman Sachs to take
            advantage of the LIA's extremely limited financial and legal
            experience to deliberately exploit its position of influence and
            to take advantage in a way that generated colossal losses for
            the LIA but substantial profits for Goldman Sachs,' LIA
            Chairman AbdulMagid Breish said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Libya's sovereign wealth fund built up assets of about $60
            billion under Muammar Qaddafi, who was deposed and killed in a
            2011 coup. The LIA lost about $1.75 billion betting on
            structured products in 2007 and 2008, about $900 million of
            which was with Goldman Sachs, its former chairman, Mohsen Derregia, said in June 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trips, Gifts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staff at the New York-based bank offered to train LIA
            employees at its London offices, took them on a trip to Morocco
            and bought them gifts to build a relationship, the fund said in
            the court filing. The 2008 derivatives were linked to shares in
            Citigroup Inc. (C), Electricite de France and Banco Santander SA. &lt;/p&gt;

            corporate-credit index trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has
            left the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank,
            confirmed the departure and declined to comment further. Prabhu,
            who didn't immediately return an e-mail seeking comment, joined
            Goldman Sachs in 2001 and became a managing director in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, which
            contains 125 companies from Ford Motor Co. to Staples Inc., is
            one of the most liquid credit instruments. Banks, hedge funds
            and other money managers have bought and sold a net $81.6
            billion of the current high-grade benchmark swaps index as of
            Jan. 24, according to the Depository Trust Clearing Corp.,
            which runs a central repository for the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sean Meeker, the head of loan and loan credit-default swap
            trading, and Jeff Bahl, the head of U.S. high-yield corporate
            bond trading, left Goldman Sachs in December, the bank confirmed
            at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-risk, high-yield bonds are rated
            below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and lower than BBB- at
            Standard Poor's. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
            borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
            defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. picked
            Raanan Agus to manage Liberty Harbor after the credit investment
            unit's Chief Investment Officer Gregg Felton quit this week,
            ending a six-year tenure there. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brendan McGovern and Sal Lentini will be the co-heads of
            Liberty Harbor's investment team, reporting to Agus, who is also
            global co-head of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, according
            to an internal memo sent on Jan. 28. Andrea Raphael, a
            spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McGovern was head of research and Lentini was head of
            credit trading in the Liberty Harbor team, according to the
            memo. Both were also senior portfolio managers. Agus will
            continue to run GSIP, a hedge fund that handles client money,
            with Ken Eberts, the firm said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McGovern and Lentini were part of a 17-person team led by
            Felton that Goldman Sachs hired in 2006 from defunct hedge fund
            Amaranth Advisors LLC. Liberty Harbor, which is part of Goldman
            Sachs's asset management group, is a global multi-strategy fund

        <headline>Oracle to Goldman Lead Record First Half Bond Offerings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bond sales worldwide capped
            the busiest first half of a year on record as borrowers take
            advantage of investor demand stoked by central banks'
            unprecedented stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which sold a
            combined $14 billion yesterday, pushed offerings during the
            first six months of 2014 to $2.29 trillion, beating the previous
            peak of $2.28 trillion issued during the same period in 2009,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yesterday was the
            busiest day since June 10 in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central banks' actions to depress short-term lending rates
            have impelled institutional investors to seek higher-yielding
            company debt. While the European Central Bank cut its main
            refinancing rate to a record-low 15 basis points on June 5, the
            U.S. Federal Reserve is holding its benchmark rate near zero
            into a sixth year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The demand for these corporate bonds is so strong it's
            outstripping the record supply,' said Brian Reynolds, chief
            market strategist for brokerage firm Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
            in New York. 'Institutional investors like insurance companies
            and foundations are buying more aggressively now than ever in
            order to reach their yield targets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Issuance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oracle, the largest maker of database software, issued $10
            billion of bonds yesterday in the second-biggest dollar-denominated corporate bond offering this year, while
            Goldman
            Sachs sold $4 billion of notes, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Yesterday's offerings in the U.S. totaled $15.9
            billion, Bloomberg data show. The year's biggest corporate issue
            in the U.S. was a $12 billion sale from Apple Inc. in April, the
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuance is accelerating as borrowers take advantage of
            yields approaching historic lows and the extra yield investors
            demand for the risk of holding corporate bonds instead of
            government securities is at about the least since 2007, Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. corporate bond market is off to its fastest pace
            for the first half of the year with more than $880 billion sold,
            up from $789 billion in the same period last year, Bloomberg
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-grade offerings reached $683.2 billion for the
            first half, beating the previous record of $655.4 billion set in
            the same period in 2009, Bloomberg data show. Yesterday's high-grade sales of $14.75 billion were the most
            since $16.1 billion
            on May 12, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;High Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade sales also reached a record for the first
            half, with $196.8 billion that topped the previous high of $184
            billion in 2013, the data show. High-yield, high-risk bonds are
            rated below Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service and less than BBB-at Standard Poor's. A basis point is 0.01
            percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. corporate bonds have generated returns of 5.9 percent,
            or 12.2 percent annualized, which would be the last decade's
            second best year after 2009. In the first half of that year,
            issuance surged as banks sold securities backed by the Federal
            Deposit Insurance Corp.'s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program
            and credit markets began to unfreeze after the financial crisis,
            reviving investor confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Europe, companies are debuting a record amount of bonds
            as investors demanding higher yields show greater tolerance for
            untested borrowers who are seeking to diversify funding as banks
            curtail lending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It reflects the reduced ability of European banks to make
            business loans,' said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's
            Capital Markets Research Group. 'Non-financial companies are
            being forced to enter the bond market to secure capital'
            because they can't rely on banks for loans, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of junk bonds in Europe exceeded $100 billion this
            year for the first time, up from $56 billion in the first half
            of 2013, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The record global bond issuance has a European accent,'
            said Lonski. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Doubts Oil Rally Is Enough for Venezuela: Andes Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Venezuelan bonds are posting the
            world's best returns after a surge in the price of oil, the
            country's biggest export. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
            Stanley say buyers are unwise to bet $115-a-barrel crude can fix
            a broken economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government's dollar-denominated notes have gained 5.9
            percent since rebels took over swaths of northern Iraq on June
            11, stoking concern that crude production will be hurt and
            pushing Brent oil prices over $115 for the first time since
            September. While the return was more than 14 times the average
            for emerging-market debt, the extra yield of 8.63 percentage
            points that investors demand to own Venezuela's bonds instead of
            U.S. Treasuries is still the highest in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Any extra cash generated by the OPEC member's oil exports
            is likely to be siphoned off to pay for imports of consumer
            goods amid shortages of drinking water, toilet paper and
            medicine that have sparked anti-government protests, according
            to Daniel Volberg, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
            After currency devaluations and energy output declines,
            President Nicolas Maduro is struggling to prop up an economy
            posting the world's fastest inflation and facing the worst
            growth prospects outside Equatorial Guinea, according to the
            International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The level of macroeconomic dysfunction is so deep that
            the story really isn't about oil prices anymore,' said Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin American economist at
            Goldman Sachs in
            New York. 'Unless policies change dramatically, I'd be
            concerned even with the oil price at $150.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Currency Controls &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since Maduro succeeded his mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, in
            March 2013, the economy's stagnation has deepened as currency
            controls impeded imports and factories shut down. The number of
            cars built in Venezuela fell 77 percent in the first five months
            of this year as automakers including Ford Motor Co. and Toyota
            Motor Corp. froze production while American Airlines Inc. (AAL) and
            Air Canada have cut back flights to the country because of
            difficulty getting money out. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, the nation has kept paying its debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Venezuelan dollar bonds have returned 19 percent this year,
            the best performance among developing countries, as suppressed
            interest rates in the U.S. and Europe boosted demand for higher-yielding assets. The average yield on
            Venezuela's dollar debt is
            the highest in the world at 11.16 percent, 0.8 percentage point
            more than lower-rated Argentina, which faces default as soon as
            July 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank Meetings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Venezuela will continue to meet its obligations, Rafael
            Ramirez, the economy vice president, said June 27. Officials are
            meeting representatives of Bank of America Corp. Citigroup Inc.,
            Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs in Caracas
            to discuss debt, Ramirez said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Venezuela's Finance Ministry didn't respond to e-mail
            messages sent yesterday seeking comment on the government's
            debt-payment policies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in New York
            declined to comment, as did Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for
            Deutsche Bank in New York. Press officers at Bank of America,
            Citigroup and Goldman Sachs didn't respond to requests for
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Fundamentals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's rally in the bonds doesn't 'make sense given
            the direction fundamentals are going in Venezuela,' Volberg
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country's international reserves fell 18 percent in the
            last 12 months to $21 billion on June 27. Arrears to importers
            and their banks may be worth as much as half the central bank's
            reported reserves, Volberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Annual inflation reached 61 percent in May after the
            government carried out its biggest devaluation since the
            introduction of currency controls in 2003. The economy will
            probably contract this year and next by as much as 1 percent,
            according to the IMF. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While higher oil provides some benefits, signs that Maduro
            is turning toward more pragmatic policies after four months of
            unrest across the country may be more encouraging to investors,
            according to Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last month Maduro fired Planning Minister Jorge Giordani, a
            long-term advocate of currency controls who taught Chavez
            economics in jail in the early 1990s. The country plans to merge
            its three official foreign exchange rates, Ramirez told
            investors in London in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Exchange Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rates range from 6.3 bolivars per dollar to 50 bolivars
            per dollar. On the black market, the bolivar trades at 72.18 per
            dollar. The government is likely to unify exchange rates at
            about 25 per dollar, according to Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost to the government of exchanging its oil dollars
            for bolivars at the official rate is the equivalent of 10
            percent of gross domestic product, and authorities make that up
            by printing money, according to Francisco Rodriguez, an
            economist at Bank of America in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Venezuela has a source of revenue it can use and with
            unification it would pretty much solve its fiscal problem,'
            Rodriguez said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country's oil exports are falling as production wanes
            at state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Oil sales declined 8.4
            percent last year to $114 billion, the company said June 27.
            Output sank about 11,000 barrels a day in 2013 to a total of 2.9
            million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technical indicators based on historical prices also
            indicate the Venezuelan bonds may have risen too far, too fast.
            The 14-day relative strength index on dollar bonds has been
            above 70 since June 19, indicating they're the most overbought
            in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The question is how long the markets are willing to give
            Venezuela a free pass and how long this process can go on before
            you have a more disorderly adjustment,' Volberg said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman 'Boys Club' Accused of Mocking Women as 'Bimbos' and 'Party Girls'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was accused of widespread gender discrimination and a 'boy's club'
            atmosphere that included bouts of binge drinking and trips to strip clubs, as two former female employees
            seek to expand their lawsuit against the firm with new evidence. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The women asked a
            federal judge in Manhattan today to let them sue on behalf of current and former female associates and vice
            presidents. Support for their claims includes statements of former Goldman Sachs employees, expert
            statistical analyses and evidence on earnings and promotions from the firm's own records, they said in a
            court filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Women report a 'boy's club' atmosphere, where binge drinking is common
            and women are either sexualized or ignored,' according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The two women, H. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, sued in 2010 and are seeking to broaden
            the case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at Goldman Sachs. A decision by U.S.
            District Judge Analisa Torres to allow the women to sue as a class would increase the risk to Goldman Sachs.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in 2010, the women seek unspecified damages and an order requiring
            Goldman Sachs to fix the alleged gender bias at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Fined $800,000 by Finra Over Dark-Pool Pricing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was fined
            $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for
            failing to have procedures in place to ensure clients in its
            dark pool got the best price while trading stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 395,000 transactions were executed in the New
            York-based bank's Sigma X pool at an inferior price to the
            national best bid and offer from July 29 to Aug. 9, 2011, Finra
            said today in a statement. Stock venues in the U.S. are obliged
            to price trades at the NBBO or better. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs discovered the pricing errors and sent checks
            to customers to compensate for the mistakes, people with direct
            knowledge of the matter said in March. Finra said today that the
            firm returned $1.67 million to affected customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was unaware of the errors at the time,
            according to the Finra statement. The Standard Poor's 500
            Index tumbled 13 percent through the first eight days of August
            2011, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index
            hit a multiyear high of 48 on Aug. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs neither admitted nor denied Finra's charges.
            Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Names Hitchner as Asia Head, Replacing Ryan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top
            underwriter of share sales in Asia excluding Japan this year,
            said Ken Hitchner will become president for the region after
            David Ryan retires later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hitchner, who currently runs health-care banking and is co-head of the technology, media and
            telecommunications group, will
            be based in Hong Kong, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an
            e-mailed statement. Ryan, 43, will become a senior director, the
            bank said, without providing a reason for his retirement after
            two years in the role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm, which this year ceded its position as
            the top mergers adviser for Asia excluding Japan, hired Kate Richdale from Morgan Stanley (MS) in March to
            strengthen investment
            banking services. Hitchner will also work with Mark Schwartz,
            who rejoined the firm last year as chairman of the Asia-Pacific
            business, and Masa Mochida, who oversees Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs has been pretty good at regularly rotating
            people through the top positions,' said Philippe Espinasse, a
            Hong Kong-based former equity capital markets banker at UBS AG
            and Nomura Holdings Inc. Hiring someone with mergers experience,
            'is probably a function of the maturity of the Asian market
            now.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Navy Pilot &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue for Goldman Sachs in Asia climbed 16 percent to
            $5.39 billion last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hitchner, a 53-year-old former U.S. Navy pilot, has been
            with Goldman Sachs since 1991. As a banker in the health-care
            industry for more than 15 years, he has advised clients
            including Johnson Johnson (JNJ) on its $19.7 billion takeover of
            Synthes Inc. in 2012. He will oversee the day-to-day operations
            of Asia-Pacific businesses, excluding Japan, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser for equity and
            equity-linked offerings in Asia, excluding Japan, this year,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's up from No. 5
            last year, the data show. The bank slipped to fourth in Asian
            MA advisory this year, excluding Japan, after having held the
            top spot for the past two years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ryan, a former head of the Asian financing group, was named
            co-president of the bank's Asian operations in 2011, along with
            Yusuf Alireza, who has since left the firm. During his tenure,
            the bank exited its seven-year investment in Industrial
            Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world's largest lender by
            market value. He has been with the firm since 1992. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was accused by two former employees seeking to expand their lawsuit
            of discriminating against women while male colleagues engaged in binge drinking and took clients to strip
            clubs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The women asked a federal judge in Manhattan yesterday to let them sue on behalf
            of current and former female associates and vice presidents. Support for their claims includes statements of
            former Goldman Sachs employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence on earnings and promotions from the
            firm's own records, they said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Women report a 'boy's club'
            atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored,' according to the
            filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two women, H. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, sued in 2010 and are
            seeking to broaden the case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at Goldman Sachs. A
            decision by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to allow the women to sue as a class would increase the risk
            to the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in 2010, the women seek unspecified
            damages and an order requiring Goldman Sachs to fix the alleged gender bias at the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Salaries,
            Promotions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Female vice presidents earned 21 percent less than men and female associates
            made 8 percent less, the former employees claimed. About 23 percent fewer female vice presidents were
            promoted to managing director of the bank relative to their male counterparts, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those
            statistics are attributed to an analysis of Goldman Sachs pay data by Henry S. Farber, a Princeton
            University economist. His samples included all associates and vice presidents in the firm's New York class
            from 2003 to 2011 and throughout the U.S. from 2005 to 2011, according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has denied the women's claims and is fighting the case. The bank believes the
            statistical arguments are misleading and don't compare similar employees to one another, said a person
            briefed on its legal strategy who requested anonymity because the firm hasn't responded to the data in
            court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is a normal and anticipated procedural step for any proposed class action
            lawsuit and does not change the case's lack of merit,' David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
            yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Strip Clubs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster and
            Orlich are seeking to persuade Torres that their claims are sufficiently similar to those of other women at
            Goldman Sachs so they can represent them in a single case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They're asking Torres to
            certify a class of female associates and vice presidents who worked for the company in the U.S. in its
            investment banking, investment management and securities divisions beginning Sept. 10, 2004. The start date
            for employees who worked in New York City would be July 7, 2002. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denise Shelley, a vice
            president who left the firm in 2009, said in a court filing that men at Goldman Sachs repeatedly called
            women 'bimbos,' mocked a new hire who had won a beauty pageant and took clients to strip clubs. Shelley said
            in the filing that she sat on the steering committee of the firm's network for women and, after joining
            colleagues at a bar, was called a 'party girl' by a managing director. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is
            Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs Co., 10-cv-06950, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Names Hutton to Head Bond, Currency Sales in Australia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
            appointed Nell Hutton to head its fixed-income, currency and
            commodities sales for Australia and New Zealand, an internal
            memo showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hutton will report both to Simon Rothery, chief executive
            officer of Goldman Sachs' Australian operations, and to James Houghton, head of fixed-income, currency and
            commodities
            distribution for Asia Pacific ex-Japan, according to the memo
            seen by Bloomberg News. Hutton, who previously oversaw corporate
            advisory solutions in the region, joined Goldman in 1999 in
            London, relocated to Australia in 2006, and was named a managing
            director in 2007, the memo showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothery said in a Feb. 27 interview that Australian fixed-income trading was his biggest growth
            area in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's stable AAA credit rating made the nation a
            haven and has encouraged inflows from sovereign-wealth funds, he
            said. Goldman Sachs also saw opportunities to arrange debt
            offerings and capture more of the market for Kangaroo bonds, or
            Australian dollar-denominated securities sold by overseas
            borrowers, Rothery said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Banker Korenberg Is Told SEC Galleon Probe Closed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker
            Matthew Korenberg, the subject of a years-long insider-trading
            probe tied to Galleon Group LLC, was told he won't be sued by
            regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Hueston, a lawyer for Korenberg, said in a telephone
            interview that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
            which was ready to file a civil complaint 18 months ago,
            officially 'de-authorized' his client as a lawsuit target.
            Hueston said it's 'extraordinary' for the SEC to be persuaded
            to drop a case it was ready to proceed with. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Too often cases are filed and reputations are ruined
            before mistakes of fact and judgment are realized,' Hueston
            said. 'There has been real cost here.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC has had mixed success in trials over insider-trading allegations. It lost a jury verdict
            last month against
            STEC Inc.'s former chief executive officer, Manouchehr
            Moshayedi, whom it accused of making $134 million from insider
            information. That was its third loss since October out of four
            such cases to go trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 20 people have been convicted of insider trading
            tied to the investigation of Galleon Group and the fund's co-founder, Raj Rajaratnam. He was convicted in
            2011 and is serving
            an 11-year prison sentence for masterminding one of the most
            sprawling insider-trading schemes in a generation. His brother
            Rengan is on trial for insider trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Abbott Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC and U.S. prosecutors were investigating Korenberg
            for insider trading involving Abbott Laboratories Inc.'s
            acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics Inc. in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After a separate investigation, ex-Baltimore Orioles third
            baseman Doug DeCinces was charged with making $1.3 million in
            profit from insider information about that transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The DeCinces case isn't connected to Korenberg's, Hueston
            said. A parallel criminal investigation of Korenberg was
            previously closed, according to the lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Korenberg left Goldman Sachs at the end of 2012 and has
            been focused on defending against the allegations, Hueston said.
            He was a banker at Goldman in San Francisco and now lives in the
            Philadelphia area, Hueston said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment
            on Korenberg's case. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>CVC Said to Pick Goldman, Deutsche Bank for Link Net Share Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;CVC Capital Partners Ltd. picked
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse
            Group AG to manage a sale of its shares in Indonesian Internet
            service provider PT Link Net Tbk (LINK), people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The London-based buyout firm may raise about $500 million
            from the offering, two of the people said, asking not to be
            identified as the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CVC is seeking to divest its stake after Link Net stock
            more than tripled since listing on the Indonesia Stock Exchange
            last month. At $500 million, the share sale would be the biggest
            in Indonesia this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, CVC and Indonesia's Lippo Group raised $1.5
            billion divesting their stakes in PT Matahari Department Store (LPPF)
            in Indonesia's biggest share sale, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. PT First Media Tbk, a company backed by Lippo Group, is
            the other main investor in Link Net. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CVC owns a 49 percent stake in Link Net, valued at about
            $742 million at the current share price, according to exchange
            filings. Link Net's initial public offering raised $42 million,
            data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported the bank mandates
            yesterday, citing unidentified people. CVC declined to comment
            in an e-mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Given Two-Year Phase-Out for Some Swaps Trades</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will have
            another two years to separate derivatives trading from units
            that get federal backing, according to a letter to the bank
            posted on the Federal Reserve website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed said in the letter that the New York-based bank
            must determine whether to kill the swaps activity or move it to
            properly capitalized affiliates. Under the Dodd-Frank Act rule
            requiring the swaps push-out, interest-rate and some credit
            swaps can still be traded inside the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The potential impact of granting a 24-month transition
            period is less adverse than the potential impact of denying the
            transition period,' Robert Frierson, secretary of the board,
            wrote in the letter dated yesterday. Giving Goldman Sachs the
            transition time lowers 'the probability of operational problems
            and market disruption,' Frierson wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dodd-Frank overhauled swaps trading in an effort to make
            the industry less vulnerable to a crisis such as the one that
            struck in 2008. The law requires equity, some commodity and non-cleared credit derivatives be pushed out of
            bank units with
            access to deposit insurance and the Fed's discount window. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
            declined to comment on the extension. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Drops Investigation of Witness Against Goldman's Tourre</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission dropped an investigation of a key witness in its
            fraud case against former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive
            Fabrice Tourre, according to a lawyer for the witness. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre faces a July 15 trial on the SEC's lawsuit over his
            role in structuring a collateralized debt obligation known as
            Abacus 2007-AC1. His lawyers are seeking information from former
            ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. executive Laura Schwartz about an
            SEC notice she received earlier this year that the regulator may
            bring an action against her unrelated to Abacus. She is expected
            to testify against Tourre, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC, in a June 27 letter, told Schwartz's lawyer that
            its New York field office completed its investigation and didn't
            intend to recommend action against her, the lawyer, Robin
            Alperstein, said in a letter to the judge overseeing the Tourre
            case yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC says Tourre misled ACA and other investors in
            Abacus, claiming he didn't disclose that hedge fund Paulson
            Co. Inc. helped pick the securities underlying the CDO with the
            intention of betting against them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CDOs are pools of assets such as mortgage bonds packaged
            into new securities. Interest payments on the underlying bonds
            or loans are used to pay investors. The Abacus entity was a
            synthetic CDO, meaning its cash flow came from derivatives that
            referenced mortgage-backed securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in 2010 agreed to pay $550 million to settle
            SEC claims against it in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will provide an additional $70 million, ReNew

            $385 million in the Gurgaon-based developer since 2011. The ADB
            will invest $50 million and an Indian fund managed by GEF will
            provide $20 million, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money will allow ReNew to double its clean-energy
            portfolio to 1,000 megawatts by 2015, ReNew said. Goldman Sachs
            has invested more than $3 billion in clean energy companies such
            as Nordex SE (NDX1) and Dong Energy A/S, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the third-largest manager of Japanese equity offerings this year, is
            urging companies to sell shares and meet renewed investor demand
            for the nation's stocks under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Makoto Ito, co-head of the bank's financing group in Tokyo,
            plans to visit senior executives at more than 15 Japanese firms
            this week to propose that they consider raising funds, he said
            in an interview on July 1. Ito met global investors last week in
            Hong Kong and Singapore who manage more than 100 trillion yen
            ($1 trillion) in assets, he said, declining to name any of the
            companies or investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dentsu Inc. (4324) and Suntory Beverage Food Ltd. (2587) are among
            Japanese companies that are funding expansion abroad by issuing
            shares. The nation's equity offerings more than quadrupled to
            2.7 trillion yen in the first half of 2013, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. Ito, who was pessimistic on the market after
            stocks plunged since May, now says second-half sales will top
            the 1.5 trillion yen raised in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Global investors still have the appetite and a
            constructive view of Japan even under turbulent and uncertain
            circumstances,' Ito said after meeting with U.S. and Asian
            sovereign funds, hedge funds and asset managers on June 27 and
            28. 'Japanese firms are becoming more decisive to raise funds
            for investment and acquisitions for growth.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Peugeot Rises as Goldman Sees Carmaker Beating Cash Goal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG), Europe's second-biggest carmaker, rose the most in almost seven weeks
            after
            analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the unprofitable
            company is likely to beat a goal of reducing cash consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peugeot jumped as much as 8.1 percent to 6.73 euros as of
            and was trading up 8 percent at 10:59 a.m. in Paris, the
            steepest intraday increase since May 17. Volume was 89 percent
            of the three-month daily average. The stock has gained 23
            percent this year, recovering from a 23-year low in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reorganization measures taken by Paris-based Peugeot and
            its Faurecia (EO) car-parts unit may lead to negative operational
            free cash flow of 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion), narrower
            than the manufacturer's forecast of cash consumption at 1.5
            billion euros, Stefan Burgstaller, a London-based analyst at
            Goldman Sachs, said in a note to clients dated yesterday.
            Europe's economy may be improving, helping revive industrywide
            car sales, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised its recommendation on Peugeot shares
            to buy from neutral and added it to the bank's 'conviction
            list.' Burgstaller also increased the stock-price estimate by
            8.4 percent to 9 euros a share from 8.30 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The maker of the Peugeot 308 hatchback and Citroen DS
            models is struggling to return to profit as the European car
            market heads into a sixth consecutive year of contraction.
            Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin, who started his
            second four-year term in June, is seeking to end cash burn at
            the company by the end of 2014, after the carmaker consumed 200
            million euros a month last year. The strategy includes expanding
            sales outside Europe, eliminating 11,200 jobs in France by 2015
            and shutting a factory near Paris. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gus Levy, who ran Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in the 1970s, used to stomp around the trading
            floor proclaiming that his bank wasn't relevant if it lost out on a block trade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now,
            Levy's successors are more wary about chasing deals as they watch competitors make ever-more aggressive
            bids, including one trade where Citigroup Inc. (C) paid more than market price, to take the lead in buying
            big chunks of stock from investors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Block-trading remains a bastion where Wall Street
            risk-takers can still wager at a time when regulators are clamping down on banks betting with their own
            money and computer software increasingly controls stock trades. Competition is as hot as it has been since
            2005, and a couple of recent deals have left companies at risk for losses. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Temasek Said to Invest in Shanda's Cloudary</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Temasek
            Holdings Pte agreed to buy a minority stake in China's Cloudary
            Corp. (READ) at a 25 percent lower valuation than in a previous funding
            round, said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The private placement values the operator of literary
            websites at about $600 million, less than an earlier valuation
            of $800 million, the people said, asking not to be identified
            because the information is private. Cloudary is controlled by
            Shanda Interactive Entertainment Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cloudary, which filed for a U.S. initial public offering
            more than two years ago, has yet to start the share sale. A
            gauge of Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. last month traded at
            the widest discount since 2008 to the Nasdaq Composite Index as
            measured by price-to-earnings ratios, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equity funds managed by Orbis bought 1.875 percent of
            Cloudary in May 2012 for $15 million, according to a filing with
            the Securities and Exchange Commission last year. The deal
            valued the company at $800 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear exactly how the investment in Cloudary will
            be carried out. Officials at Temasek, Goldman Sachs and Shanda
            declined to comment or weren't immediately available. Sina.com
            reported on the investment by Goldman Sachs and Temasek earlier
            today, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cloudary, based in Shanghai, applied for a $200 million New
            York IPO in May 2011. Goldman Sachs had been named to help
            manage the listing in July 2011 though is no longer involved in
            the process. The company, led by former Bank of America Corp.
            banker Robert Chiu, hired Bank of America, Citic Securities Co.
            and CICC HK Securities as underwriters, according to a filing
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts 2013 Forecast for U.S. Gas on Higher Supplies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. natural gas will average $3.85
            per million British thermal units in the third quarter and $4.25
            in the fourth quarter, below earlier forecasts as supply
            increases, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Debottlenecking' at the Marcellus shale sites in West
            Virginia and Pennsylvania are among the drivers of supply gains,
            Goldman Sachs analysts led by Damien Courvalin in New York said
            in an e-mailed report today. Goldman previously forecast U.S.
            natural gas prices would be $4.50 in the third and fourth
            quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Production gains may be 'temporary' because the number of
            gas rigs operating is low, Goldman said. Natural gas prices need
            to increase to $4.25 per million Btu by 2014 to bring rigs back
            into active production and keep the market balanced, Courvalin
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Banks Racing to Pare Swaps Holdings Ahead of Rules, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks are racing to
            simplify their swaps holdings before new rules make it more
            costly to own the derivatives starting in 2017, according to a
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They're doing so increasingly through a process known as
            compression, said Andy Hudis, a managing director at Goldman
            Sachs who runs the credit valuation adjustment desk in London.
            Through this technique, offsetting transactions are eliminated
            so that a bank can reduce, say, 100 trades into 10 that give the
            identical position. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Swaps helped cause and intensify the 2008 financial crisis
            given the opaque entanglements they created among banks. In
            response, global regulators took a series of steps to reduce
            risk, including boosting the amount of money they have to set
            aside to guarantee the transactions. Compression can help them
            reduce that burden, while also reducing market complexity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For dealers, this is an extremely important topic right
            now,' Hudis said today during a presentation sponsored by
            Bloomberg Markets magazine and LCH.Clearnet Ltd. Compressing
            swaps to reduce the outstanding value in notional terms for
            banks is among the top three goals among Wall Street firms now,
            he said. Notional values don't represent actual money that has
            changed hands and determine payment flows under swap contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C), Bank of America
            Corp. (BAC), Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) were the five largest
            U.S. swaps dealers as of Dec. 31, according to the Office of the
            Comptroller of the Currency. Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP
            runs a swap-execution facility where the derivatives trade.
            Since 2003, more than $400 trillion in notional value of
            interest-rate swaps has been compressed, according to TriOptima,
            an ICAP Plc division that pioneered the technique. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Safeguards &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Improving the safety and structure of over-the-counter
            derivatives was a central goal of global regulators after swaps,
            the largest segment of the $710 trillion market, helped cause
            the financial crisis and then worsened its aftermath. Netting
            down swaps by compression is encouraged in both the Dodd-Frank
            Act in the U.S. and the European Market Infrastructure
            Regulation legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'So now it's the law,' Stephen O'Connor, chairman of the
            International Swaps Derivatives Association, the industry's
            lobbying and trade group, said during the same presentation
            today. 'While the law generally gets people's attention,' the
            new capital rules from the Basel Committee on Banking
            Supervision are what is really driving the demand, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While compressing trades has been around for over a decade,
            'there is a new sense of urgency from market participants,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Capital &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's because under Basel III rules starting in 2017,
            banks will face higher capital requirements for their swaps
            activity related to the amount of leverage they use in day-to-day operations and the cash and securities
            they deposit at
            clearinghouses that's used in case of a default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For example, a bank with swaps worth $1 trillion in
            notional value on its books could face $180 million in minimum
            capital charges under the leverage ratio in some cases, said Dan Maguire, global head of LCH.Clearnet's
            SwapClear service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's a pretty sizable amount,' he said, speaking
            during the presentation today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;International regulators are trying to safeguard trades and
            bring more openness to a market whose secrecy and sheer size
            overwhelmed authorities in 2008. Where swaps had been one-on-one
            deals before, now they would be backstopped by third parties in
            clearinghouses that ensure everyone can pay, with the aim of
            avoiding emergency bailouts and panic. Basel is made up of
            regulators from 27 of the world's largest economies and sets
            international bank supervisory guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If banks hadn't been netting down their trades since 2003
            some in the industry estimate there could now be $1 quadrillion
            of the contracts outstanding, according to ISDA's O'Connor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If that number even exists,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Copper Seen by Goldman Grinding Lower as Demand in China Wanes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Copper prices will 'grind lower'
            over the next six to 12 months as production costs decline and
            demand softens in China, the largest consumer, according to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumption of the metal will fall with the weakening of
            China's property sector, which accounts for 50 percent of the
            nation's copper demand, analysts including Jeffrey Currie and
            Max Layton wrote in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices will also fall as commodity financing deals
            gradually unwind, output disruptions at smelters ease and
            China's state stockpiler slows purchases, Goldman said. The bank
            forecasts prices at $6,200 a metric ton at the end of 2014,
            compared with $7,131.50 at 2:31 p.m. Hong Kong time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Production of the metal used in wiring and pipes will
            exceed consumption by 385,000 tons this year and 454,000 tons in
            2015, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The projections contrast with Morgan Stanley's positive
            outlook amid what it sees as a global shortage. Morgan Stanley
            forecast prices to average $7,055 a ton in the second half of
            this year, it said in a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copper has rallied 11 percent since closing at a 44-month
            low on March 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Increased state stockpiling by China is one risk to
            Goldman's estimates, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Pound's Rally Becoming Burden, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Having the past year's best-performing major currency may become a burden for the U.K.
            economy, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After reaching the highest level since 2008 on July 7, a
            trade-weighted index of the pound fell for a third day today as
            a report showed shop prices tumbled by the most since at least
            2006 in June. A gauge of inflation expectations dropped to a
            three-month low, adding to signs the strength of the currency
            may be impair future growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The currency is up on a trade-weighted basis almost 10
            percent in the last year,' Kevin Daly, an economist at Goldman
            Sachs in London, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television's
            'On The Move' with Manus Cranny. 'That leads us to expect
            that while growth will remain strong, it will moderate to some
            extent as the year goes through.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pound declined 0.1 percent to 79.57 pence per euro at
            4:20 p.m. London time. It touched 79.15 pence on July 7, the
            strongest level since September 2012. The U.K. currency was
            little changed at $1.7136. A trade-weighted index compiled by
            Deutsche Bank AG fell 0.1 percent to 84.33, after touching 84.71
            two days ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pound has climbed against all of its 16 major peers in
            the past year as investors bet the Bank of England will be the
            first major central bank to end extraordinary stimulus measures.
            While economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the BOE will
            leave its benchmark rate at a record-low 0.5 percent tomorrow,
            derivatives markets show investors are betting on a 0.25
            percentage-point increase by February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BOE Testimony &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nemat Shafik, who's set to join the Bank of England's three
            main policy committees as head of banking and markets, told
            lawmakers in London today that the recent pace of the U.K.
            recovery is 'striking.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Recent output growth and employment have been
            surprisingly strong,' Shafik said in written testimony. She
            will take part in her first Monetary Policy Committee meeting
            next month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. shop prices declined 1.8 percent in June from a year
            earlier, the British Retail Consortium said today. A report
            yesterday showed manufacturing unexpectedly slumped 1.3 percent
            in May from April, the biggest plunge in 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pound long positions are 'vulnerable to unwind' and the
            currency may struggle to extend its advance against the dollar,
            strategists at BNP Paribas SA led by London-based Steven Saywell, wrote in an e-mailed note. A long position
            is a bet
            that an asset will increase in value. Against the euro, the
            analysts forecast sterling will continue to strengthen to 78
            pence per euro this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five-year break-even rate, a gauge of market inflation
            expectations, fell to 2.813 percentage points today, the least
            since March 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ten-year gilt yields rose two basis points to 2.66 percent.
            The 2.25 percent bond maturing September 2023 fell 0.13, or 1.30
            pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.66. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gilts returned 3.7 percent this year through yesterday,
            according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities
            earned 5 percent and Treasuries gained 3.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>European Sugar Seen by Goldman Staying Low on Supplies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;European sugar prices that are
            already the lowest since 2011 will stay low with production
            quotas ending in 2017, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;White, or refined, sugar in the European Union averaged 574
            euros ($781) a metric ton in April, the lowest since September
            2011 and 21 percent lower than a year earlier, according to data
            from the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. In 2017,
            the EU will end caps on how much sugar domestic producers, which
            mostly use beets, can sell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Lower sugar prices are here to stay as we expect the
            pending change in regulation to result in an increase in sugar
            supply from Europe when quotas are abolished,' Katherine Tait,
            an analyst at Goldman, said in a report dated yesterday. 'This
            was a driver of the rapid deterioration in prices over the last
            six months as the market adapts to the change.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Suppliers in Europe, particularly in the U.K., are becoming
            more competitive on price to gain access in 'key markets,'
            Tait said. Goldman said in September EU sugar prices will fall
            to 500 euros in 2017-18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU will produce 18 million tons of sugar in 2014-15, 7
            percent more than 16.83 million tons in the 2013-14 season
            started Oct. 1, the French crop office FranceAgriMer said
            yesterday. In the U.K., the new beet crop for 2014-15 is making
            'very good progress,' according to Associated British Foods
            Plc. (ABF), which owns British Sugar, the nation's only beet
            processor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sugar prices have declined globally with supplies set to
            exceed demand for a fourth year in 2013-14 at 4.4 million tons,
            according to the London-based International Sugar Organization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;White, or refined, sugar for delivery in October fell 0.9
            percent to $455 a ton by 2:51 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
            Futures dropped 25 percent in the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;

            because the bank hasn't announced her appointment. She'll be
            part of a push by continental Europe's biggest bank to boost
            profits from advising the rich and to catch up with UBS AG and
            Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain, facing
            stricter capital requirements that make some investment banking
            operations unprofitable, promoted Michele Faissola, one of his
            investment-banking lieutenants, to run wealth and asset
            management last year. Jain said in June he's meeting with top
            clients himself to help meet the goal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kitidis ran a team at Goldman Sachs that created
            derivatives for private and institutional clients, according to
            a biography on a Bentley University alumni page. The item says
            she was in the class of 1997 at the school in Waltham,
            Massachusetts. She joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 1998,
            according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records.
            Kitidis was named a managing director in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Petrobras Rises After Goldman Adds Stock to Top List: Rio Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3), Brazil's
            state-controlled oil producer, rose to the highest in more than
            seven months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended the
            stock as its top energy pick in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman added Petrobras to its 'Latam Spotlight List' in
            a July 13 note to clients, saying the company will benefit from
            higher production volumes and the appreciation of the Brazilian
            real. The oil producer is also poised to gain from potential
            gasoline price increases after a presidential election in
            Brazil, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
            rose 4.5 percent to 19.10 reais in Sao Paulo, the highest since
            Nov. 29. That extends its 4-day gain to 10.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to see a compelling risk/reward for the stock
            at current levels,' Goldman (GS) analysts including Felipe Mattar in
            Sao Paulo said in the note. Mattar reiterated a 'buy'
            recommendation on the stock. The company is experiencing 'a
            turning point in production that we expect to accelerate.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Lifts S&amp;amp;P 500 Estimate to 2,050 on Rising Profits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's 500 Index will
            climb 4.2 percent to 2,050 by the end of 2014 as economic growth
            picks up, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by David Kostin forecast, boosting an earlier projection
            of 1,900. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stocks with lower valuations will outperform the market
            before the Federal Reserve begins tightening interest rates, the
            strategists wrote. Goldman Sachs's year-end projections for the
            SP 500 in 2015 and 2016 remained unchanged at 2,100 and 2,200,
            respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect the equity rally will continue, but the
            trajectory will be shallow,' the group wrote in a note to
            clients dated July 11. 'Domestic economic growth is
            accelerating, and earnings will continue to rise, but further
            P/E multiple expansion is unlikely.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kostin's new forecast makes Goldman Sachs the fourth most-bullish out of 19 Wall Street firms
            tracked by Bloomberg. The
            SP 500 has been trading above Kostin's previous year-end
            forecast of 1,900 for almost two months amid growing optimism
            that the economy was accelerating following a first-quarter
            slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 trades for 18.1 times its companies reported
            earnings, the highest level since March 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lower-valuation stocks and those with weak balance sheets,
            low returns on capital and low margins will lead the market's
            gains before the Fed's interest rate tightening, Kostin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Viewed in relation to bonds, the U.S. equity market still
            appears attractively valued,' the Goldman group wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stocks Rebound &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced today, with the SP adding 0.5 percent
            to 1,977.10 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
            Average climbed 111.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,075.42. The
            Russell 2000 Index jumped 0.5 percent after its worst weekly
            decline in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rebounded today following its worst week since
            April amid signs of financial stress in Europe and speculation
            by firms including Raymond James Associates Inc. that stocks
            may be due for a pullback. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Improving macroeconomic data prompted Goldman economists
            earlier in the month to predict the Fed will increase interest
            rates in the third quarter of 2015, compared with an earlier
            forecast for the first quarter of 2016. The Fed will lift its
            benchmark rate to 4 percent by 2018, Goldman wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman is 'quite confident that the U.S. economy is
            accelerating to an above-trend pace,' chief economist Jan
            Hatzius wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Buy Rating Spurs Air Arabia to 5-Year High: Dubai Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI) surged to the
            highest level in almost five years as volume jumped after
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) upgraded the Middle East's biggest no-frills carrier to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of the airline jumped 5.1 percent to 1.23 dirhams,
            the strongest since October 2008, at the close in Dubai as
            volume increased to 122 million shares, 4.9 times the stock's
            three-month daily average. Air Arabia was the biggest gainer in
            percentage terms on the benchmark DFM General Index (DFMGI), which rose
            0.7 percent, taking an eight-day rally to 8.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Air Arabia's stock has advanced 7.9 percent in the two days
            since Goldman Sachs raised the shares to buy from neutral with a
            price estimate of 1.54 dirhams, a 25 percent premium to today's
            closing price. Nine out of 13 analysts have a buy rating on the
            carrier, which is based in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The U.A.E. and Qatar
            were upgraded to emerging-market status last month by MSCI Inc. (MSCI) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both the rating upgrade and the MSCI emerging-markets
            inclusion spurred the shares today, according to Amer Khan, a
            Dubai-based director at Shuaa Asset Management. Dubai's bid to
            host the World Expo 2020 may be the next catalyst, which 'would
            bode particularly well for the likes of Air Arabia,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai plans to double the number of visitors to 20 million
            by 2020 and triple annual revenue from the industry to 300
            billion dirhams ($82 billion) amid an economic recovery, the
            government said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Air Arabia's first-quarter passenger traffic rose to a
            record 1.45 million, the airline said in April. The company said
            last month it plans to start flights to the capital of Armenia
            in August, the fifth new route in 2013 and its 86th globally
            from Sharjah, Egypt and Morocco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The airline may post a 9 percent increase in full-year
            profit to 457 million dirhams, according to the mean estimate of
            eight analysts compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Risk of Oil Prices Gaining Amid OPEC Supply Losses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said price
            risks for Brent crude in the second half of the year have
            changed 'to the upside' amid production losses in some OPEC
            nations and political threats to supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reductions in output from Libya, Iraq and Nigeria have the
            potential to limit availability, the bank said today in an e-mailed report. Even so, increased production
            outside the
            Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will probably keep
            global markets adequately supplied this year, said Goldman,
            which forecasts Brent crude to average $105 a barrel in the
            second half. Brent futures traded at about $108 a barrel in
            London today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The risks have shifted more to the upside over the short
            term due to the possibility of continuing OPEC production
            shortfalls and increased geopolitical risks,' Jeff Currie, the
            head of commodities research in New York, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OPEC output fell by 370,000 barrels a day in June amid
            unrest and violence in Libya, Iraq and Nigeria, the
            International Energy Agency said in its most recent monthly
            market report on July 11. The losses come just as increasing
            seasonal demand for motor fuels is pushing up global oil
            consumption, Goldman said. OPEC supplies about 40 percent of the
            world's crude. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Posts Surprise Profit Gain on Trading, Deal Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reported a surprise increase in second-quarter profit as fixed-income
            revenue fell less than many analysts projected and investment-banking fees rose. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net
            income climbed 5 percent to $2.04 billion, or $4.10 a share, from $1.93 billion, or $3.70, a year earlier,
            the New York-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $3.09 average estimate of 25 analysts in
            a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, has pledged not to
            overreact to a trading slump that's now in its fifth year as he positions the firm to pick up market share
            from other banks that are pulling back. Blankfein is also relying on underwriting stocks and bonds, which
            accounted for 14 percent of revenue in the second quarter, the highest portion since 2000. First-half
            investment-banking fees climbed to a record. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We've got a strong beat here, primarily
            revenue-driven, and Goldman is a little more resilient than expected,' Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Group
            Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: JPMorgan Profit Beats
            Estimates on Trading, Shares Climb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs climbed 1 percent to $168.59 at 12:42
            p.m. in New York. The stock dropped 5.8 percent this year through yesterday, making it the worst performer
            in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. (INDU) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 6 percent to $9.13 billion.
            Compensation, the firm's biggest expense, climbed to $3.92 billion, or 43 percent of revenue, the same
            percentage as a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equity Investments &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest
            surprise compared to many analysts' estimates was the gain on the firm's equity investments in its Investing
            and Lending segment, which totaled $1.25 billion. That was almost double the $650 million expected by
            Barclays Plc's Jason Goldberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said that
            business has repeatedly been a strong performer, Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo Co., said
            investors value such revenue at lower multiples than that of other units because it's so unpredictable. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They had a very good quarter in principally selling some assets in their private-equity
            portfolio,' said Kenneth Leon, an analyst who covers the financial industry for SP Capital IQ. 'It was the
            lumpy transactions that really made the revenue stand out.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;FICC Results &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currency and commodity trading revenue was $2.22 billion, surpassing estimates of
            $1.79 billion from Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., and $2.1 billion from Goldberg at
            Barclays. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 9 percent second-quarter drop in bond-trading revenue, excluding an
            accounting adjustment, beat the 24 percent decline predicted by Burnell. JPMorgan Chase Co. today posted a
            15 percent drop in fixed-income revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's revenue from the equities
            division declined 11 percent from a year earlier to $1.63 billion, excluding accounting adjustments. That
            compared with Hintz's $1.54 billion estimate and Goldberg's $1.71 billion projection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            the trading performance was better than expected, it still marked the lowest first-half revenue since the
            financial crisis in 2008. The bank earned a 10.9 percent return on equity in the quarter, a third of the
            level before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Abnormal' Trading &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs President Gary Cohn, 53, said in May that the current environment is 'abnormal' and features trading
            clients that are the least active in years. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield maintained the smallest
            range in 35 years in the three months ended in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If markets never move or don't
            move, our clients really don't need to transact,' Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The firm has cut 10 percent
            of its fixed-income workforce since 2010 and reduced the risk-weighted assets in that business by $90
            billion in the past two years. It has also relied on other businesses for growth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter
            revenue from investment banking, the business run globally by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John
            S. Weinberg, climbed 15 percent to $1.78 billion. That compared with JPMorgan's $1.77 billion in
            investment-banking revenue and Citigroup's $1.34 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs figure
            included $506 million of financial-advisory revenue, including fees for takeover advice, an increase of 4
            percent. Revenue from underwriting climbed to $1.28 billion in the quarter, including $730 million from debt
            underwriting and $545 million for equity offerings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;MA Advice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs held the top spot among arrangers of global equity, equity-linked and rights offerings in the first
            half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked first in advising on announced mergers and
            acquisitions and fifth in underwriting U.S. bonds, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investing and Lending
            posted total second-quarter revenue of $2.07 billion, up from $1.42 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            firm has about $8 billion of stakes in private-equity funds that it must cut to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, which limits the amount banks can invest in such funds, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Revenue
            from asset management, run by Timothy O'Neill and Eric Lane, rose 8 percent to $1.44 billion. Total assets
            under supervision climbed $59 billion during the quarter to $1.14 trillion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Stress-Test Stumble Leads to Repo Cut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
            to resubmit its capital plan this year after falling below a
            minimum leverage ratio, used that experience as motivation to
            cut lending through repurchase agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
            billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
            Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
            assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm's
            'matched book' repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said today in a conference call with
            analysts after the
            New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
            bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
            supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
            compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
            reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
            Reserve's stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
            percent minimum of a separate requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
            a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
            potential,' Schwartz said. 'One of the significant inputs into
            the process obviously was CCAR.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
            securities lending to fund clients while using the same
            collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Repo Failures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's asset reductions also affect other secured
            financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn't
            release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results today,
            it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and secured
            financing agreements at the end of March, which represented
            about 40 percent of its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank hadn't seen a pressing need to cut back on the
            low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
            test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
            according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm's
            discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs's
            decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
            anonymous because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
            the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
            have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
            deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
            repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot's been written about the repo markets,' Schwartz
            said on the call. 'Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
            matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
            but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
            because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
            constraints.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's ratio under the proposed supplementary
            leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
            firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Beats Estimates on Investment Banking, Debt Gains</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said earnings doubled, beating analysts' estimates on a surge in
            underwriting revenue and gains from the firm's own investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net
            income rose to $1.93 billion, or $3.70 a share, from $962 million, or $1.78, a year earlier, the New
            York-based company said today in a statement. That beat the $2.89 average estimate of 27 analysts in a
            Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains from debt investments almost tripled and fixed-income trading
            climbed 12 percent as Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, led Goldman Sachs through a drop in
            bond prices sparked by indications in May that the Federal Reserve may ease economic-stimulus measures. The
            bank has said it will benefit from expense cuts completed last year and a rebound in the U.S. economy that
            could fuel stock gains. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Look ahead, and the opportunity is really on risk-taking moving
            from debt to equity, and that plays very much into Goldman's strengths,' Kenneth Leon, an analyst at
            Standard Poor's Capital IQ unit, told Erik Schatzker and Sara Eisen in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
            'Directionally Goldman looks good.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $2.76, or 1.7 percent, to $160.24
            at 4:04 p.m. in New York. The stock had gained 28 percent this year through yesterday after advancing 41
            percent in 2012. The shares are still below their pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tesla Falls on Goldman Sachs Price Target: Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) shares fell 14
            percent, the most in more than 18 months, after Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. set a target price more than 30 percent lower than
            the electric-car maker's close yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla plunged to $109.05 at the close in New York, the
            biggest one-day decline since Jan. 13, 2012. Shares of the Palo
            Alto, California-based company have more than tripled this year,
            compared with an 18 percent increase in the Russell 1000 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patrick Archambault, a Goldman Sachs auto analyst, set a
            Tesla target price of $84, the average of three scenarios. That
            compares with Tesla's close of $127.26 yesterday and its record
            $129.90 close on July 12. The report's best-case scenario was a
            target price of $113. Goldman Sachs cited 'sustainability of
            demand longer term' as among the risks for Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla shares have surged as the popularity of its $69,900
            Model S sedan helped generate a first-quarter profit, the
            company's first. The automaker is ramping up production of the
            car and is preparing to introduce a sport-utility vehicle next
            year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also downgraded the auto industry to neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Auto stocks typically lag when rates rise,' Archambault
            wrote. 'This has occurred even in the face of rising demand.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
            Street bank that generates most of its revenue from trading,
            sold $2.5 billion of five-year bonds after reporting second-quarter profits that beat analysts' estimates.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2.9 percent notes, expected to be rated A3 by Moody's
            Investors Service, yield 155 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold $2.75 billion of 2.375 percent
            debentures due 2018 in January that were priced to yield 165
            basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. Those
            securities traded yesterday at 98.8 cents on the dollar to yield
            2.66 percent, or a 127.7 basis-point spread, according to Trace,
            the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
            Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that earnings doubled on a surge
            in underwriting revenue and gains from the firm's own
            investments. Second-quarter net income rose to $1.93 billion, or
            $3.70 a share, from $962 million, or $1.78, a year earlier. That

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Raises First-Half Pay Less Than Revenue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, set aside a
            smaller portion for staff pay in the first half and cut 300 jobs in the second quarter as it seeks to pare
            expenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation, which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of
            deferred pay awarded in prior years, rose 10 percent to $8.04 billion in the first six months, the New
            York-based company said today in a statement. Revenue in the same period increased 13 percent to $18.7
            billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, is controlling expenses to
            boost return on equity, a measure of profitability, above last year's 10.7 percent. Compensation was 38
            percent of revenue in 2012, the second-lowest since Goldman Sachs has been a public company. The ratio of
            pay to revenue fell in the first half to 43 percent from 44 percent in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The culture around compensation is really making sure that we continue to attract and retain all
            the best people,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said at an investor conference in May. 'The firm
            now is running with 75 percent more capital now than it was before the crisis, and so we want to make sure
            that we do our best to get the balance right for our shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first-half
            compensation expense is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs's 31,700 employees $253,691 for the first six
            months of the year. The firm set aside $7.29 billion in the same period of 2012, equal to an average
            $225,789 for each of the 32,300 people employed by Goldman Sachs at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation
            for corporate and investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest U.S. lender, was almost
            unchanged in the first half from a year earlier. The $6.36 billion represented 33 percent of revenue at the
            unit, which was created last year when the company combined its investment bank with the corporate bank and
            treasury and securities-services units. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Figures for average pay don't represent what any
            employee actually receives and are calculated by dividing the total compensation expense by the number of
            workers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Is 'Comfortable' With U.S. Leverage Ratio</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said the firm is 'very
            comfortable' with its ability to meet a proposed U.S. minimum
            ratio of capital to assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, speaking on a conference call with analysts and
            investors today, declined to estimate where the leverage ratio
            stands for the parent company or the bank subsidiary. Under the
            U.S. plan, the company would need capital equal to 5 percent of
            assets and the bank unit must have 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will wait to see how the U.S. proposal
            changes before taking action, Schwartz said. Earlier this year,
            he told investors the New York-based bank had benefited from not
            acting on a proposed rule on risk weighting for mortgages, a
            regulation that was later softened. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a proposed rule, so let's see how the dialogue
            goes with regulators,' Schwartz said. 'Predicting rules and
            responding can be incredibly costly, you can get wildly
            misdirected.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proposed leverage ratios for the biggest U.S. banks go
            beyond the 3 percent global minimum requirement that the Basel
            Committee on Banking Supervision approved to help prevent
            another financial crisis. The changes would make eight lenders
            fund more of their assets with capital that can absorb losses
            instead of with borrowed money. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which said
            a jump in European deals helped it post record underwriting
            revenue in the second quarter, is holding its board of directors
            meeting this week in Germany, the Continent's largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chairman Lloyd C. Blankfein and the other directors are
            traveling to Frankfurt and Berlin, according to two people
            briefed on the trip who requested anonymity because the details
            weren't public. The board met with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann yesterday and will meet with other top
            German officials
            this week, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's 13-member board of directors has typically
            held a meeting annually outside of the U.S., traveling in past
            years to Brazil, Russia, India and China. The New York-based
            bank opened its office in Frankfurt in 1990, the year that
            Germany last won the World Cup soccer tournament before taking
            the title again this week in Brazil. The firm's analysts
            predicted in May that Brazil would win. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the second-ranked underwriter of equity
            offerings in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, behind Deutsche
            Bank AG, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It advised
            Volkswagen AG, Europe's largest carmaker, on its takeover of
            truck producer Scania AB, the second-largest deal this year
            involving a German company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Monika Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
            to comment on the trip and whether board members would meet with
            German Chancellor Angela Merkel. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Forecasts Lower Commodity Prices as Cycle Ends</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities from iron ore to copper
            and Brent crude will drop over the next five years as global
            supplies climb, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            highlighted oil's recent losses as a sign of increased output. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There will be substantial declines in some metals, energy
            and bulk commodities, analysts including Chief Currency
            Strategist Robin Brooks wrote in a report. The period of
            continued year-on-year price rises for most commodities is over,
            they said in the report, which was dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks from Citigroup Inc. to Deutsche Bank AG have called
            an end to the commodities super-cycle, when China's surging
            demand combined with supply constraints to more than double
            prices in the 12 years through 2010. Raw materials rallied this
            year from three annual losses as a lack of rain in Brazil lifted
            coffee and a ban of ore exports from Indonesia spurred a rally
            in nickel. The drop in energy prices since last month showed the
            impact of higher global output, Goldman said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A prolonged period of elevated commodity prices has
            catalysed a supply response,' the analysts wrote. 'We do not
            expect a collapse in global commodity prices. But we do
            anticipate substantial declines.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copper was forecast to drop to $6,600 a metric ton over
            five years, while iron ore was seen at $80 a ton and Brent may
            be $100 a barrel, according to Goldman. The steel-making raw
            material was at $98 a dry ton in Tianjin, China, today, and
            copper traded at $7,123 on the London Metal Exchange today.
            Brent was 33 cents higher at $106.35 on the ICE Futures Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Looser Supply' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials climbed
            3.4 percent this year. That compares with a 0.9 percent drop in
            the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index and 5.3 percent advance in the
            MSCI All-Country World Index of equities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Against a looser supply backdrop, commodity prices should
            be much less sensitive to fluctuations in global growth than
            they were,' Goldman said in the report, entitled 'Emerging
            Market Forex and the End of the Commodity Market Super-Cycle.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman said in a January report the cycle that spurred
            higher commodities prices is reversing as increased U.S. shale
            oil output keeps energy prices low, and that would eventually
            drive raw materials into a bear market. The new cycle would be
            the opposite of the super-cycle, it said then. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. production of crude, along with liquids separated from
            natural gas, surpassed all other countries this year with daily
            output exceeding 11 million barrels in the first quarter, Bank
            of America Corp. said in a report July 4. Output climbed as
            hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling help producers to
            pull record volumes of crude out of shale formations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Oil Supplies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent rallied to as much as $115.71 a barrel last month as
            military gains in Iraq by an al-Qaeda breakaway group stoked
            concern that oil supplies from the region may be disrupted.
            Prices posted a third weekly loss in the period to July 11, with
            Iraqi shipments unaffected and Libya moving to boost exports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Less than a month has passed since geopolitical risks in
            Iraq pushed up oil prices on concerns over a potential oil
            supply shock, and the market seems to have absorbed the related
            risks reasonably well,' Goldman's analysts wrote. 'The
            expansion in oil supply over the past few years -- primarily
            from the expansion of U.S. shale production -- has minimized the
            consequences from past disruptions in Libya and Iraq.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore entered a bear market in March on prospects for a
            glut as supplies surged. Rio Tinto Group (RIO), the world's second-largest mining company, said today iron
            ore production in the
            three months to June gained 11 percent, while Fortescue Metals
            Group Ltd. said its shipments were 57 percent higher on year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Surplus Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We remain bearish on iron ore, and expect a surplus
            market to drive the longer-term price down,' the Goldman
            analysts wrote in yesterday's report. 'We see limited upside
            for agricultural commodities over the longer run.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said last month commodity prices will remain
            subdued for years as many of the factors and fears that drove
            the super-cycle have dissipated. Citigroup said in April 2013
            that death bells would ring for the commodity super-cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our long-term commodity forecasts suggest that
            fundamentals for commodity currencies will deteriorate,' the
            Goldman analysts wrote. 'Relative shifts in terms of trade
            between commodity importers and exporters will be a key input to
            currency determination over the coming years.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Stress-Test Stumble Leads to Cut in Repo Lending</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
            to resubmit its capital plan this year after falling below a
            minimum leverage ratio, used that experience as motivation to
            cut lending through repurchase agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
            billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
            Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
            assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm's
            'matched book' repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said yesterday in a conference call
            with analysts after
            the New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
            bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
            supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
            compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
            reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
            Reserve's stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
            percent minimum of a separate requirement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
            a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
            potential,' Schwartz said. 'One of the significant inputs into
            the process obviously was CCAR.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
            securities lending to fund clients while using the same
            collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Repo Failures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's asset reductions also affect other secured
            financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn't
            release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results
            yesterday, it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and
            secured financing agreements at the end of March, which
            represented about 40 percent of its assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank hadn't seen a pressing need to cut back on the
            low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
            test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
            according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm's
            discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs's
            decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
            anonymous because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
            the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
            have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
            deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
            repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot's been written about the repo markets,' Schwartz
            said on the call. 'Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
            matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
            but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
            because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
            constraints.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's ratio under the proposed supplementary
            leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
            firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells Redi Stake to Group of Wall Street Firms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            agreed to sell a majority stake in Redi, a unit that provides
            trading technology, to a group of Wall Street firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The buyers include Bank of America Corp. (BAC)'s Merrill Lynch
            unit, Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA (BNP), Citadel LLC and Lightyear
            Capital LLC, according to a statement today. New York-based
            Goldman Sachs will keep a 'significant minority equity stake'
            in the company. Financial terms were not disclosed. Rishi
            Nangalia, who previously co-managed Goldman Sachs's electronic
            trading business development group, will serve as the company's
            chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The diversification of Redi's ownership may make the unit
            more attractive to clients compared with being controlled by a
            single brokerage, according to Jamie Selway, head of electronic
            brokerage and sales at Investment Technology Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman is heading toward a consortium approach,' Selway
            said in a phone interview. 'Clients are more comfortable with
            broker neutrality in the context of independent technology
            providers or consortium of broker dealers. The operation of
            these systems requires a technology culture and can be
            expensive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired the software that formed the basis
            for Redi when it purchased New York Stock Exchange specialist
            Spear, Leeds Kellogg LP in 2000 and has expanded it to handle
            trades in asset classes such as currencies and interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;RealTick &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's plans come about two years after London-based Barclays Plc (BARC) sold the RealTick
            trading platform, which
            lets customers access services from multiple brokers, to New
            York-based ConvergEx Inc. Barclays said in December 2010 that it
            planned to use the system within its investment banking unit and
            offer the platform to customers. The bank got RealTick when it
            acquired parts of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase Co., Knight Capital Group
            Inc. and other securities firms bought execution-management
            systems starting in the mid-2000s to give mutual funds and other
            clients access to exchanges and algorithms, or trading
            strategies that allow them to process larger orders in small
            pieces over a preset period, along with other transaction
            services. Some platforms were open to the algorithms of multiple
            brokers or technology providers while others focused on those
            from a single firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment Technology Group (ITG) and Instinet Inc., a subsidiary
            of Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc., offer execution platforms
            to customers. Both firms are execution-only brokers that don't
            trade with their own money. Bloomberg LP, the parent of
            Bloomberg News, offers similar systems. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Treasuries May Post Losses for 3 Years, Goldman's Beinner Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Treasuries may produce negative
            returns over the next two to three years as the Federal Reserve
            winds down its bond-buying program and interest rates rise,
            according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The benefits of owning long-term government bonds have
            been eroded,' Jonathan Beinner, co-head of global fixed-income
            and liquidity management at the unit of Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc., said to reporters in New York. There's 'very little
            cushion. Expected returns are likely to be less than cash, and
            are likely to be negative.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke reiterated before Congress
            today that the bond purchases could be reduced more quickly or
            expanded as economic conditions warrant. Bond market measures
            such as overnight index swaps project that the Fed's target rate
            for overnight loans may be increased by 25 basis points in the
            first quarter of 2015, after being kept in a range of zero to
            0.25 percent since December 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should 'limit the amount of U.S. interest-rate
            risk in a portfolio,' Beinner said. If the yield on the 10-year
            Treasury note rises to 4 percent to 5 percent over the next two
            to three years, returns will be negative, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on the 10-year note was 2.5 percent today, after
            touching an almost two-year high of 2.75 percent on July 8. The
            yield is forecast to end the year at 2.63 percent according to
            the median forecast of 67 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasuries have lost 2.4 percent this year, according to
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, amid speculation that the
            Fed may begin to slow asset buying under its quantitative-easing
            strategy. U.S. government debt gained 2.2 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There's the 'opportunity to own other markets,' Beinner
            said, adding that Goldman Sachs Asset Management is 'favorably
            disposed' to fixed-income securities of emerging markets,
            including Brazil and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The refuge demand for Treasuries has declined, Beinner
            said, adding that Goldman Sachs Asset Management has 'an
            optimistic outlook' on the U.S. economy and favors high-yield
            securities and credit returns, floating-rate assets, bank loans
            and leveraged-loan assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross domestic product should climb between 2.54 percent to
            3 percent in 2014 with the U.S. economy on 'relatively strong
            footing,' Beinner said. A median forecast of 96 economists in a
            Bloomberg News survey estimate GDP should rise by 2.7 percent in
            2014, up from an estimate of 1.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the Fed ends QE in mid-2014, then the first rate
            increase may be in 'earlier 2015, rather than later,' said
            Beinner, who also serves as chief investment officer at Goldman
            Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Witness Says Tourre Didn't Disclose Paulson Role</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            employee who ran the firm's mortgage correlation trading desk
            testified that Fabrice Tourre failed to tell investors about the
            role of Paulson Co. in the deal at the center of the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission's fraud case against him. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Egol, now a Goldman Sachs managing director, told
            jurors in Manhattan federal court today that he is 'not aware
            of any' disclosures to investors that Paulson, the New York
            hedge fund that stood to make money from the failure of Abacus
            2007-AC1, a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, helped
            select the mortgage-backed assets underlying it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egol said Tourre did make sure to tell a superior that
            Paulson helped pick the portfolio of 90 subprime mortgage-backed
            securities when Goldman's money was at risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Tourre and Goldman Sachs in 2010 over the
            Abacus transaction. Paulson, run by billionaire John Paulson,
            used the deal to bet against mortgage-backed securities.
            Investors on the other side of the bet lost more than $1
            billion. Goldman Sachs, based in New York, paid a then-record
            $550 million to settle the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Tourre after dropping a plan to file claims
            against Egol, according to interviews with SEC enforcement staff
            conducted by the agency's inspector general, which were made
            available to Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act
            request. Egol testified yesterday that Tourre was the Goldman
            Sachs employee primarily responsible for the Abacus transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Four Hours &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egol testified for about four hours, yesterday and today,
            under questioning from SEC lawyer Matthew Martens. He's being
            questioned by Tourre's lawyers this afternoon. The SEC told U.S.
            District Judge Katherine Forrest yesterday that after Egol, it
            plans to call former Goldman Sachs saleswoman Gail Kreitman as a
            witness and play a Jan. 17, 2007, recorded call between Kreitman
            and ACA Financial Guaranty Corp.'s Lucas Westreich. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC claims Kreitman told Westreich that Paulson was
            taking a long, rather than a purely short, position in Abacus,
            passing along false information she got from Tourre. The agency
            says ACA, which lost money in a long bet on the transaction,
            would have refused to serve as portfolio selection agent and
            wouldn't have invested in the transaction if it had known that
            Paulson stood to gain from its failure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC said it expects Kreitman to testify that she
            doesn't recall who told her Paulson was buying the equity
            tranche in Abacus, but that she generally recalls Tourre was the
            most likely source of the false information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Streamlining Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC had planned to call David Gerst, another one of
            Tourre's former Goldman Sachs colleagues, after Egol. SEC
            lawyers told Forrest they moved up Kreitman as part of an effort
            to streamline their case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The change in the SEC witness list came after Martens spent
            most of yesterday battling with Paolo Pellegrini, the former
            Paulson executive who helped Paulson's fund make more than $15
            billion shorting subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pellegrini frequently argued with Martens and claimed the
            SEC tricked and intimidated him in its investigation into the
            Abacus transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Batista Exit Makes MPX a Buy as EON Takes Over</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Eike Batista's loss of
            control of MPX Energia SA (MPXE3) to Germany's EON SE is making the
            Brazilian power producer a buy to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, which had not rated Rio de Janeiro-based MPX's
            shares since March, set its price target for the utility at 10
            reais. The stock rose 1.2 percent to 6.99 reais at the close of
            trading in Sao Paulo. The shares have fallen 31 percent in the
            past year, the least among the six publicly traded companies
            founded by Batista, which have declined as much as 91 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Batista, who rode a surge in Brazilian stocks to become the
            world's eighth-richest person in March 2012, quit as MPX's
            chairman earlier this month after EON increased its stake to 36
            percent. A selloff of shares in Batista's energy, commodities
            and cargo companies erased more than $30 billion of his fortune
            after they failed to meet output targets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect a gradual de-risking of MPX shares,' Bruno Pascon, the Goldman Sachs analyst who took
            over primary coverage
            from Felipe Mattar, wrote in a research note dated yesterday.
            'EON's controlling stake and MPX's contracted revenues should
            meaningfully reduce any overhang related to concerns over the
            EBX Group.' EBX is Batista's holding company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Not Compatible' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A credibility crisis that started with his flagship oil
            producer OGX Petroleo Gas Participacoes SA is obscuring the
            achievements of companies like MPX, Batista wrote in an opinion
            piece published in the newspaper Valor Economico today. MPX's
            current market value 'is not compatible' with what the company
            has to offer, he said. MPX's market value is $2.2 billion,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'MPX has the biggest portfolio of licensed projects in the
            country,' he wrote. The company 'has become a model' for
            thermal power producers along the coast, and generates enough
            electricity to power the city of Rio de Janeiro, according to
            Batista. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's Pascon said MPX has a 'solid' balance sheet and
            will have 'above average' free cash flow starting in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MPX has five buy recommendations from analysts, four holds
            and one sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman had rated MPX a buy from May 2012 through March,
            when it changed the stock's designation to 'not rated.' The
            New York-based investment bank includes stocks on that list when
            it's 'acting in an advisory capacity in a merger or strategic
            transaction involving this company and in certain other
            circumstances,' according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BofA to Goldman Sachs Lead $30 Billion of Bond Offerings in U.S.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led at least $30 billion of corporate bond
            sales in the U.S. this week, the busiest period in almost two
            months, as relative yields narrowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, sold $2
            billion of 10-year securities and New York-based Goldman Sachs
            issued $2.5 billion at its lowest relative yield for five-year
            debt since the financial crisis, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Offerings increased from $24.6 billion last week and
            were the most since $36.8 billion in the five days ended May 24. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own company bonds
            rather than government debentures narrowed to 219 basis points
            yesterday from 227 basis points on July 12, according to the
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch US Corporate High Yield index.
            Yields decreased to 3.99 percent from 4.13 percent, and compare
            with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America sold $2 billion of 4.1 percent debt due
            July 2023 at a relative yield of 157 basis points, Bloomberg
            data show. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender will use
            proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes,
            according to a person with knowledge of the transaction, who
            asked not to be identified citing lack of authorization to speak
            publicly. The debt is rated A- by Standard Poor's, Bloomberg
            data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bonds Gain &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bonds rose 0.9 cent today from the issue price to 100.8
            cents on the dollar to yield 4 percent, or a spread of 148.9
            basis points, at 9:09 a.m. New York time, according to Trace,
            the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
            Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold 2.9 percent debentures due July 2018 at
            a relative yield of 155 basis points, its lowest spread on five-year securities since it sold $2 billion of
            5.45 percent notes
            at a 110 basis-point spread in October 2007, Bloomberg data
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities climbed 0.9 cent since the July 16 sale to
            100.8 cents on the dollar to yield 2.72 percent, or a 139.9
            basis-point spread at 9:18 a.m. in New York, Trace data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of investment-grade debentures rose to at least $25
            billion from $23.1 billion last week and above a 2013 weekly
            average of $21.9 billion, the data show. Offerings of
            speculative-grade bonds reached at least $5.3 billion, compared
            with $1.5 billion last week and a 2013 weekly average of $7.3
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody's
            Investors Service and lower than BBB- at SP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Issuers planning sales include tobacco processor Alliance
            One International Inc. with a $790 million sale of eight-year
            notes, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Managing Director Nicholas Valtz Found Dead</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Valtz, a managing director
            in cross-asset sales at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in New York,
            was found dead yesterday by family members who went searching
            for him after he didn't return from a kiteboarding outing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valtz, 39, was found in Napeague Harbor near the eastern
            end of Long Island, according to the East Hampton, New York,
            police. He was a 'novice kiteboarder' and was found floating
            in the water secured to his kite, police said in a statement
            released yesterday. Other kite gear was found in a grassy area
            of the harbor, police said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're deeply saddened by this tragedy and our thoughts
            are with Nick's family,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman for
            Manhattan-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valtz, who joined the firm in 2000, was promoted to
            managing director in 2010. As a cross-asset sales executive, he
            helped manage orders for trading clients and pitch them products
            and ideas among different types of securities. His wife, Sashi
            Valtz, also works at Goldman Sachs as head of global third-party
            research sales, according to her LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Andrew Valtz was born in September 1974 and
            received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1996,
            according to New York voting records and Harvard's website. The
            school lists him as earning letters in fencing for three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Police are still investigating the death, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hybrid Sport &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kiteboarding is a convergence of windsurfing and
            paragliding that has attracted technology executives including
            Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Also called
            kitesurfing, it propels riders across water at speeds as fast as
            40 miles per hour (64 kilometers per hour), on boards about 4
            feet to 5 1/2 feet long (1.2 meters to 1.7 meters). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For steering, a crossbar is connected to the kites with
            lines. Using waves as ramps, riders can vault 10 feet to 40 feet
            out of the water and often spin before landing. They can stop by
            pushing the crossbar to deflate the kite, or by ditching in the
            surf. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In March 2008, Valtz shaved his head to raise money for
            childhood cancer research, according to the website for St.
            Baldrick's Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valtz enjoyed technology products and fast cars, according
            to the website for his brother-in-law's 2012 wedding in which he
            was a groomsman. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>BofA to Goldman Lead Tsunami of Bank Bond Sales: Credit Markets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Banks around the world are stepping
            up bond sales, with lenders from Bank of America Corp. to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accounting for the biggest share of
            dollar-denominated investment-grade deals in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Offerings by lenders from the U.S. to Europe and Asia rose
            62 percent to $26.4 billion last week from $16.3 billion in the
            period ended July 12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Almost 60 percent of high-grade sales in the U.S. this month are
            from banks, the biggest proportion in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks in the U.S. are attracting bond buyers with second-quarter earnings beating analyst estimates
            by 8.7 percent, the
            widest margin of any industry. The yield on the Bloomberg U.S.
            Corporate Bond Index Financials has declined to 2.84 percent
            from an 11-month high of 3.18 percent reached June 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The reporting season is done and dusted and interest-rate
            volatility has stabilized,' said Norval Loftus, chief
            investment officer at Allegra Investment Management (U.K.) Ltd.
            in London, an asset manager specializing in bond investments for
            large family offices. 'So it's a good two-part combination for
            an issuance window and for banks to increase their issues.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg financial index has gained 1.3 percent this
            month versus a 1.15 percent return for industrial borrowers.
            That's pared this year's loss for bonds of borrowers from
            Citigroup Inc. to JPMorgan Chase Co. to 0.47 percent,
            following a 4 percent loss in May and June. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Trader's Bitcoin Exchange to Fill Mt. Gox Void</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Yuzo Kano quit Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) twice: once for a rival bank, the second time to open
            Japan's first bitcoin exchange since the collapse of Mt. Gox. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Kano, 38, left his job as a derivatives and
            convertible bonds trader in December, bitcoin had climbed to a
            record $1,151. Three months later, it was worth half that after
            a $530 million heist at Tokyo-based Mt. Gox bankrupted what was
            once the virtual currency's largest exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's one less competitor for us, but it also left many
            Japanese with a very negative impression of bitcoin,' Kano said
            in an interview in Tokyo on July 17. 'We already had a company
            then and felt it was up to us to rebuild the trust.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since Mt. Gox closed in February, acquiring the digital
            currency in Japan meant going to the city's only bitcoin ATM
            machine or arranging a person-to-person deal. Kano's bitFlyer
            website allows anyone with a Japanese bank account to buy and
            sell the coins. The service began in April and eschews the
            trading options used by other exchanges in favor of a simple
            interface that would appeal to beginners, Kano said, declining
            to give subscriber numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Mt. Gox, operated by a Frenchman residing in Tokyo,
            catered mostly to foreigners, its bankruptcy was widely covered
            by domestic media. That has tended to scare off Japanese
            individuals, who Kano says are already averse to risks. Not so
            the nation's government. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
            taken a hands-off approach to the virtual currency which it sees
            aiding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to spur venture funding
            for innovation, a June report by the LDP's special committee on
            IT strategy shows. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>CIT Buys OneWest as Goldman Sachs Alumni Revive Lenders</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;CIT Group Inc. (CIT)'s $3.4 billion purchase
            of OneWest Bank, orchestrated by two former executives of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc., combines two casualties of the financial crisis.
            CIT shares surged the most since it emerged from bankruptcy in
            2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Thain, who was president of Goldman Sachs from 1999
            until 2004, will continue as chief executive officer of New
            York-based CIT, which said today it will acquire the firm known
            as IndyMac Bancorp before its 2008 collapse. CIT filed for
            bankruptcy in 2009 after losses on subprime mortgages led to a
            $2.33 billion U.S. bailout that was never repaid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since those failures, both CIT and OneWest, whose chairman
            is former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin, emerged as
            profitable lenders. Thain reversed a 2012 loss of $588.6 million
            with a $681.6 million profit last year. OneWest, backed by
            billionaires John Paulson and George Soros, hired Goldman Sachs
            this year to find a buyer while it also prepared for a possible
            initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'All of the things that needed to be fixed coming out of
            the bankruptcy have in fact been fixed,' Thain, 59, said in an
            phone interview. 'We are starting to grow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIT climbed 11 percent to $48.90 at 11:45 a.m. in New York,
            and earlier touched $49.92. Thain bought 40,000 shares of CIT on
            May 15 at $41.54, 48 cents above the stock's 52-week low,
            boosting his total to 443,000 shares, regulatory filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FDIC Takeover &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IndyMac made mortgages to people without verifying their
            income, which prompted the Federal Deposit Insurance Insurance
            Corp. to take control of the lender in 2008. IndyMac is the
            second-largest U.S. commercial bank failure on record, behind
            the collapse of Washington Mutual Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shareholders of IMB Holdco LLC, OneWest's parent company,
            will receive $2 billion in cash and 31.3 million shares of CIT
            common stock, which is valued at $1.4 billion at a price of
            $44.33, CIT said today in a statement. Both boards of directors
            approved the transaction, which requires regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mnuchin will become CIT's vice chairman and join the board
            of the combined company, as will OneWest director Alan Frank,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The transaction diversifies and lowers the cost of CIT's
            deposits, broadens the products we can offer to our middle
            market clients, is accretive to earnings and return on equity,'
            Thain said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Buyback &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIT expects the transaction to add 20 percent to earnings
            per share in 2016, according to the statement. The company also
            said today that its board approved a stock repurchase of as much
            as $500 million through the first half of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIT's takeover of OneWest is the biggest financial services
            industry deal announced this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Since the financial crisis there has been a dearth of
            takeovers among large lenders, and regulators have held up
            transactions including MT Bank Corp.'s merger with Hudson City
            Bancorp Inc., originally announced in August 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Financial institutions are much better capitalized today
            than they were prior to the crisis,' Thain said in the
            interview. 'We are in a good regulatory spot in terms of how
            they perceive us, so there's nothing that I can think of that
            would not allow this deal to get approved.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The OneWest transaction uses more than $1 billion of excess
            capital, including the $500 million of share buybacks, and
            results in a Tier 1 common ratio of 12.5 percent to 13 percent,
            CIT said today in a presentation. CIT's Tier 1 common equity
            ratio was 16 percent at the end of the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They needed to unlock their excess capital -- they were
            way over-capitalized,' Mike Mattioli, an analyst at John
            Hancock Asset Management in Boston, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. is financial adviser to CIT, and
            Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen Katz is legal counsel. Goldman Sachs,
            Bank of America Corp. and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen Hamilton LLP

        <headline>Lazard Said to Hire Goldman's Asia Restructuring Head Edwards</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lazard Ltd. (LAZ), the largest independent
            merger-advisory firm, hired Lachlan Edwards from Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. to head its Australian capital structure advisory
            business, said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edwards, who was Goldman's head of Asia-Pacific
            restructuring, will start with Lazard in Sydney on Oct. 1, the
            people said, asking not to be identified because the details are
            private. He will report to John Wylie, managing director head
            of corporate advisory for Australia, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lazard bought Sydney-based independent advisory firm
            O'Sullivan Partners in September as it seeks to expand its
            business in the South Pacific nation. Former Prime Minister Paul
            Keating is the firm's chairman of corporate advisory, according
            to Lazard's Australian website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Hayley Morris declined to comment
            on Edwards's departure. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Cuts Coffee Price Forecast as Inventories at 5-Year High</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
            price forecast for arabica coffee futures traded in New York,
            citing a surplus that will take stockpiles to a five-year high
            at the end of the 2013-14 season. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee will be at $1.30 a pound on the ICE Futures
            U.S. exchange in three, six and 12 months, the bank said in a
            report e-mailed today. That's down from a previous forecast of
            $1.45 a pound. The beans fell 12 percent this year to $1.263 a
            pound by 4:26 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global coffee production will exceed demand by 4.46 million
            bags in 2013-14, from a 10 million-bag surplus a year earlier,
            according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Inventories
            will reach a five-year high of 30.53 million bags, the USDA
            predicts. A bag of coffee weighs 132 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The expected 2013-14 surplus that would bring stocks to
            their highest level in five years is leading us to lower once
            again our three- to 12-month forecasts,' Damien Courvalin, an
            analyst at the bank, wrote in the report. 'Potential for prices
            to rebound from their current levels include weather risks in
            Brazil, the potential for further cuts to Central American
            production and short covering flows of near-record short net
            speculative positions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee gained 2.8 percent last week as a forecast
            for a cold front that may bring freezing temperatures to some
            coffee areas in Brazil, the world's top producer, resulted in
            speculators closing bets on lower prices. Some coffee growing
            areas may get freezing temperatures today and tomorrow,
            forecaster Somar Meteorologia said on July 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Net-Short Positions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Large and small speculators excluding index funds reduced
            their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, on arabica
            coffee to 28,452 contracts in the week ended July 16, data from
            the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission compiled by
            Bloomberg showed. That's down from a net-short position of
            32,941 lots a week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices of raw sugar traded in New York will also be lower
            than previously forecast, the bank said, citing a record crop in
            Brazil's center south, the main growing region of the world's
            leading producer, and a 'promising start' to the monsoon in
            second-ranking India. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sugar will be at 16.50 cents a pound on ICE in three
            months, down from a previous forecast of 17.50 cents a pounds.
            Prices will gain to 17.50 cents a pound in six months and to 19
            cents a pound in 12 months, the bank said, adding that it sees
            'downside' to its medium-term forecast. Raw sugar was down 16
            percent this year to 16.39 cents a pound. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Potential support to prices could come either from rain in
            Brazil or weather and, or production disappointments in India
            later this year, according to the Goldman Sachs report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, LME Dispute Beer Maker on Aluminum Price</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs Group Inc., the owner
            of the one of the biggest U.S. aluminum-warehouse networks, and
            the London Metal Exchange say commodity prices fell in recent
            years, countering claims of rising costs by beverage companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Delivered aluminum prices are nearly 40 percent lower
            than they were in 2006,' Goldman said yesterday in a statement,
            and the LME said there is no 'reported shortage' of the metal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MillerCoors LLC, a SABMiller Plc (SAB) and Molson Coors Brewing
            Co. venture, said at a Senate subcommittee hearing yesterday
            that unfair LME rules used by Goldman, JPMorgan Chase Co. and
            other warehouse owners boost costs and delay shipments. Senator
            Sherrod Brown, the committee chairman, plans to ask the Federal
            Reserve to explain why it allows banks to control raw-material
            supplies while trading in commodity markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The real question isn't whether prices have fallen the
            past few years, but whether prices are a true reflection of
            supply-and-demand conditions,' Jorge Vazquez, a managing
            director at Harbor Intelligence, an Austin, Texas-based research
            company, said in a telephone interview after the hearing.
            'Looking at the warehouse-business model is relevant.
            Significant changes in the system could improve fairness and
            efficiency.' &lt;/p&gt;

            About 95 percent of the aluminum used in manufacturing comes from producers and dealers outside of the

        <headline>Goldman Pares 12-Month Commodity Outlook After Crude's Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pared its
            12-month commodity return forecast to almost flat after oil
            rallied, keeping a neutral recommendation on raw materials while
            predicting losses for gold and gains for base metals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will
            return 0.1 percent over the period, the New York-based bank said
            in a report dated yesterday. That compares with a forecast gain
            of 2.3 percent over 12 months in a report on June 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The so-called strategic case for holding commodities
            remains strong, partly because raw materials are a hedge against
            geopolitical risks, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in the
            report. Commodities as tracked by the enhanced index advanced to
            the highest level since February last week as West Texas
            Intermediate crude oil traded at the highest price in 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our current outlook is extremely benign with returns
            expected to be mostly flat over the next 12 months,' the
            Goldman analysts wrote. Precious metals and agricultural
            commodities may drop 8 percent over the period, while base
            metals advance 6 percent, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crude in New York rallied 11 percent this month through
            yesterday, and settled at $108.05 a barrel July 19, the highest
            since March 2012. Political upheaval in Egypt spurred concern
            that unrest may spread, potentially disrupting shipments from
            the Middle East. The U.S., the largest oil consumer, also showed
            signs of recovery, helping to boost prices as inventories fell.
            WTI traded at $106.89 a barrel today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;UBS's Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The neutral recommendation from Goldman contrasts with the
            position from UBS AG, Switzerland's largest bank, which rated
            commodities as underweight, according to a report on July 2.
            Slow economic growth in the U.S. will boost equities more than
            raw materials, according to UBS, which is bearish on gold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion is heading for the first annual drop in 13 years
            amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will rein in stimulus
            as the largest economy improves. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will
            trim monthly bond buying to $65 billion in September from $85
            billion, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold in New York may decline to $1,050 an ounce at the end
            of 2014, Goldman said, restating a forecast from June 24. Gold
            for December delivery traded at $1,335.60 an ounce today. Most-active prices have declined 2 percent in
            2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn will decline this half as increased U.S. acreage
            boosts output, bolstering reserves, said Goldman. The 12-month
            estimate is $4.75 a bushel, 1.6 percent lower than today. Prices
            have retreated 31 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees EU Using More Gas for Power as Short-Lived</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Europe's return to favoring natural
            gas for power generation for the first time in almost three
            years will be short-lived as Russian and Norwegian gas imports
            will be needed for winter, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An excess of gas in storage is driving 'efficient' power
            plants in the U.K. to use more of the fuel at the expense of
            coal, the bank said in a report dated yesterday. Power plants in
            the U.K., Europe's biggest gas market, can consume supplementary
            inventories before the winter if prices for the fuel are at an
            average discount of 5 pence a therm (9 cents a million British
            thermal units) to coal, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Price-induced coal to gas switching is 'likely to only be
            a summer phenomenon in Europe,' analysts including London-based
            Daniel Quigley said in the report. 'Beyond the summer, we
            continue to expect European gas to return to a 2013-like
            dynamic, requiring relatively high imports from Russia and
            Norway to compensate for 11 billion cubic meters a year of
            production cuts from the Dutch Groningen gas field.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Front-month gas on the U.K.'s National Balancing Point fell
            46 percent this year to 37.15 pence a therm as Europe's mildest
            winter in seven years left high inventories, according to broker
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices may fall to average 33 pence
            in the next three months in order for coal to gas switching to
            balance the market, Goldman forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices may decline further if balancing the market requires
            power plants in northwest Europe to also switch to gas, the bank
            said. That could happen if U.K. generators don't switch to using
            gas quickly enough or due to 'strong' growth in renewables.
            Prices would need to drop below 30 pence a therm before gas-fired units in northwest Europe could compete
            with coal on a
            large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Price Forecasts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. gas prices will probably average 34.2 pence in the
            third quarter, which will be 'sufficient to correct its storage
            overhang,' Goldman said. While the usage of gas at the expense
            of coal in Germany starts to be profitable at 32 pence, prices
            need to fall further to 'kick-start this demand in the short
            run,' according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Northwest European inventories have an excess of 4 billion
            cubic meters (142 billion cubic feet) of gas over 2012 levels,
            the bank said. Without coal-to-gas switching or an escalation in
            tensions between Russia and Ukraine the surplus will be 2.7
            billion cubic meters above 2012 levels at the end of October, it
            said. It would take 24 million cubic meters a day of incremental
            demand through October to alleviate the glut. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. has spare gas-fired power capacity to increase
            demand for the fuel by 40 million cubic meters a day, according
            to the report. Switching to gas for European power generation to
            deplete excess gas inventories would result in thermal coal
            demand loss of about 5 million metric tons, which could add
            further pressure on prices already trading 'near a multiyear
            low,' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Wins $14.6 Million in Singapore Investor Clash</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was awarded
            about $14.6 million by a London judge in a dispute with a
            Singapore-based investor over shares it held as collateral on a
            loan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James Hong Gee Ho, former executive director of Blumont
            Group Ltd. (BLUM), who'd initially sued Goldman Sachs for failing to
            get the best price on his shares after a margin call, was
            ordered to pay the money by Judge David Mackie today. The amount
            included principal and interest on the loan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong was one of several Singapore executives who got into
            payment disputes with Goldman Sachs after shares of Blumont,
            Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. (LIGO) plunged during a stock
            rout in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong didn't appear in court after Goldman Sachs's legal
            team notified a law firm that had represented him that Goldman
            would ask to have the case dismissed, said Rebecca Loveridge, a
            lawyer representing the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The law firm that had represented Hong, Wiggin LLP, didn't
            return a telephone message and Hong didn't respond to an e-mail
            sent to Blumont's office in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loveridge said Hong's lawsuit was a 'tactic' to delay
            paying the money he owed. She said Hong hadn't shown any
            interest in continuing the claim and a question had arisen about
            whether Wiggin continued to represent him. His original suit
            against the bank said Goldman Sachs failed to obtain the best
            price for his shares, Loveridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Ludicrous' Figure &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs vigorously denied those claims,' Loveridge
            said. 'There was never any dispute that he entered into that
            agreement.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge declined to order Hong to make a payment toward
            an estimated 1 million pounds ($1.7 million) in fees and costs
            that Loveridge had requested because he said Goldman Sachs's
            lawyers hadn't presented evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That figure was 'ludicrous,' Mackie said. 'You want the
            court to make an order of a million pounds? There's been no
            trial.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hong stepped down as an executive director on July 20 for
            personal reasons, Blumont, which invests in minerals and energy,
            said in a statement dated July 18. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is James Hong Gee Ho v. Goldman Sachs
            International, case no. 14-17, U.K. High Court of Justice,
            Queen's Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;

            hedge-fund firm, owns 2.7 percent of the stock as of July 14,
            according to separate regulatory filings from Banco Espirito
            Santo yesterday after the market close. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said today that it 'entered into positions
            in Banco Espirito Santo by virtue of its facilitation of client
            transactions,' according to an e-mail sent to Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This purchase passes on some security to the market and
            can open the door for other institutional investors,' said Juan
            Dieste, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo will probably raise private funds to
            boost capital, Bank of Portugal Governor Carlos Costa said July
            18, saying talks with investment banks and investors indicate
            interest in the lender. The bank has lost about half its market
            value since disclosing May 20 that there were 'irregularities
            in the accounts' of a related company, Espirito Santo
            International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Costa has also tried to reassure depositors and investors
            that Banco Espirito Santo can withstand any losses that may
            result from Grupo Espirito Santo, which indirectly controls a 20
            percent stake in the bank. The concern stems from two companies
            within that group missing payments on commercial paper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo has hired Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to provide
            advice on how to strengthen its balance sheet, the bank said in
            a regulatory filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman's Tourre Says E-Mail He Sent 'Wasn't Accurate'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice president facing civil fraud claims over a
            $1 billion mortgage bond debacle, said today that one of his e-mail that's part of the government's case
            'wasn't accurate.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tourre, now a 34-year-old graduate student, appeared before a jury in
            Manhattan federal court to speak about his role in structuring and selling a 2007 mortgage-backed investment
            that lost a group of investors about $1 billion when the mortgage market crashed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            testimony comes near the end of two weeks of evidence against him by U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission. The agency's lawyers will try to show Tourre misled investors about the role of Paulson Co., the
            hedge fund run by John Paulson, in helping select the assets behind the investment, which the fund then bet
            against. He took the stand after Laura Schwartz, a participant in the deal and a key SEC witness against
            Tourre. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, who headed ACA Management LLC's asset management business in early
            2007, has testified that Goldman and Paulson led her to believe that the hedge fund wanted to invest, rather
            than take a short position in the mortgage-backed investment, known as Abacus. Instead, she helped construct
            an investment vehicle that Paulson made $1 billion betting it would fail. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Ogunlesi Lead Director as Schiro Retires</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
            Adebayo O. Ogunlesi as lead director of its board after James Schiro retired to undergo treatment for
            multiple myeloma. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogunlesi, chairman of Global Infrastructure Partners who
            joined Goldman Sachs's board in 2012, also will lead the
            corporate governance, nominating and public responsibilities
            committee, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
            Ogunlesi, 60, was previously head of the risk committee, a role
            that will be filled by Michele Burns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs gave expanded responsibilities to its lead
            independent director last year, including setting the board's
            agenda and writing a letter to shareholders in the annual proxy
            statement, as part of an agreement with an investor to drop a
            proposal that called for an independent board chairman. Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein also serves as chairman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jim Schiro defined what an effective lead director is
            through a strong model of corporate governance, and I intend to
            follow his extraordinary example,' Ogunlesi said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Multiple myeloma is a cancer in white blood cells that
            disproportionately affects older people. About 100,000 people in
            the U.S. are diagnosed each year with blood cancers, including
            leukemia and lymphoma, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
            Control and Prevention in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schiro, 68, a former CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and
            Zurich Financial Services AG, joined Goldman Sachs's board in
            2009. He also resigned today from the board of PepsiCo Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogunlesi, who was born in Nigeria, previously was head of
            global investment banking at Credit Suisse Group AG before his
            current role at Global Infrastructure Partners, a private-equity
            firm. GIP manages about $18.7 billion and has led an acquisition
            of Gatwick Airport Ltd. in the U.K. and had a stake in
            Australia's Port of Brisbane. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Burns, formerly the chief financial officer of Delta Air
            Lines Inc. and CEO of the Retirement Policy Center, has served
            on the board of directors since 2011. She was head of the
            board's audit committee, and will be replaced in that role by
            Apple Inc. CFO Peter Oppenheimer, who joined the board in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's board of directors now has 12 members, nine
            of which are designated as independent. The lead director is
            elected by the independent members. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Iron Ore Drops to One-Month Low as Goldman Keeps Bearish View</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore extended losses to the
            lowest level in a month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
            increasing production from Australia and Brazil will deepen a
            global glut every year through 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent iron content at the Chinese port of
            Tianjin fell 0.7 percent to $93.60 a dry ton today, the lowest
            since June 24, according to data from The Steel Index Ltd. The
            raw material will average $80 in 2015 from $107 this year,
            Goldman said in a report, reiterating previous forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices tumbled 30 percent in 2014 as companies from Rio
            Tinto Group to BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) increased output, betting
            higher volumes will more than offset falling prices. Citigroup
            Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley see lower rates
            through 2016 as supply expands. A manufacturing gauge in China
            climbed to the highest level in 18 months today, signaling a
            potential recovery in demand from the world's biggest user. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The large scale of supply that is entering the market
            this year will add downward pressure to iron-ore prices,'
            Gerard Burg, senior Asia economist at National Australia Bank
            Ltd. in Melbourne, said by e-mail. 'The increase in demand from
            China should be less than the increase in supply.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global seaborne output will exceed demand by 72 million
            tons this year, 175 million tons in 2015 and 323 million tons in
            2018, Goldman said. The size of the surplus, which has led to
            the shuttering of some Chinese mines, will put high-cost
            seaborne producers at risk, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Seaborne Output &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'China will not absorb every ton of incremental seaborne
            supply,' Goldman analysts including Sydney-based Christian Lelong wrote in the report. 'A material amount of
            seaborne
            capacity will eventually have to close.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The economy of China, which purchases about 70 percent of
            the world's seaborne ore, is forecast to expand 7.4 percent this
            year, the weakest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey shows. The
            government has set a target of about 7.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BHP, the world's biggest mining company, had a 19 percent
            increase in iron ore output to 56.6 million tons in the three
            months ended June from a year earlier. Rio Tinto (RIO) boosted output
            by 11 percent to 57.5 million tons in the period. The companies
            say their low-cost output will displace marginal Chinese supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest Chinese closures may be in Hebei province as
            it's the largest producer and its marginal costs are higher than
            in most other provinces, according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, ADIA Said to Weigh Joining Gavea in Snagged Fleury Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s private-equity arm and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are
            considering
            joining Gavea Investimentos Ltda. in a bid for Brazilian
            medical-services company Fleury SA (FLRY3), people with knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In joining Gavea, the two investors would be wading into a
            bid for a company that has been on the market for more than six
            months. Fleury, which has a market value of about 2.6 billion
            reais ($1.2 billion), said in March that it was in exclusive
            talks with Gavea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal has been held up, as Gavea's partners in Instituto
            Hermes Pardini Ltda. -- a closely held medical lab company that
            would be merged with Fleury -- have sought a greater role in the
            combined company, three people said, asking not to be identified
            discussing private information. It's still possible that a deal
            won't be reached, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rising incomes in Latin America's most populous country
            mean more people are leaving the public health system in favor
            of private care. That's prompting investors to seek ways to
            profit from the growing pool of health-care consumers, spurring
            deals including the takeover of Amil Participacoes SA by
            UnitedHealth Group Inc. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Fleury, Gavea, Goldman Sachs, ADIA and Hermes
            Pardini declined to comment. Gavea, JPMorgan Chase Co.'s
            Brazil private-equity and hedge-fund unit, owns a 30 percent
            stake in Hermes Pardini. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Sao Paulo-based Fleury have retreated 10 percent
            this year as the deal has dragged on. Amid the negotiations,
            Fleury also posted a net loss in the fourth quarter and missed
            sales estimates, further dragging on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pardini Family &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Pardini family, which controls Hermes Pardini, wants a
            higher valuation for their company and a greater role in running
            the combined business, the people said. Aurea Pardini, a member
            of the family, recently retained financial adviser Greenhill
            Co., while other Pardinis are working with Moelis Co. to
            negotiate those points, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The family stake at Hermes Pardini could be valued at 1.5
            billion reais, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Itau BBA SA is lining up a four-bank syndicated loan
            for Gavea, Goldman and ADIA, one person said. JPMorgan Chase
            Co. is advising Core Participa''es SA, the holding company that
            controls Fleury. Any acquirer of Fleury would have to make an
            offer to buy out the minority shareholders' stakes at the same
            price paid to the controlling stakeholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Itau, Greenhill, and Moelis declined to
            comment. Exame earlier reported that the Pardini family is
            holding up the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Raises Nickel Price Forecast as Deficit Looms Amid Ban</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
            price forecast for nickel as the market is swinging to a deficit
            next year following an ore-export ban in Indonesia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's 12-month estimate is now $22,000 a metric ton,
            up 38 percent from the previous projection of $16,000, analysts
            led by Max Layton wrote in a report. They increased zinc and
            aluminum by at least 11 percent to $2,500 a ton and $2,100 a
            ton, respectively, saying iron ore, gold and copper have 'the
            greatest downside' among the mining commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman joins Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. in boosting
            the outlook for nickel, already the best-performing base metal
            on the London Metal Exchange this year, as supplies are
            declining after the Indonesian restriction in January. The
            global nickel market will be in deficit of 201,000 tons next
            year from an estimated 20,000 ton surplus this year, with demand
            exceeding supply for aluminum and zinc this year, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Nickel is being boosted by the attempts of a large
            producer (Indonesia) to encourage value-add capacity
            domestically,' the Goldman analysts said in the report dated
            yesterday. 'We have raised out already bullish zinc, nickel and
            aluminum forecasts, and lowered our copper forecasts, reflecting
            a quick-than-anticipated shift in the relative fundamentals of
            these commodities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ban by Indonesia, which accounted for more than 20
            percent of global nickel supply in 2013, is unlikely to be eased
            until the second half of 2015, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel for delivery in three months on the LME rose 0.7
            percent to $19,180 a ton by 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 38
            percent this year. The metal touched $21,625 a ton on May 13,
            the highest since February 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Indonesian Ban &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp. raised its 2014
            forecast to $18,616, citing the ban and the possible reduction
            of Chinese nickel pig iron output. Citigroup raised its 2014
            average forecast to $18,550 and Morgan Stanley said the metal
            will average $17,640 this year and $19,346 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global aluminum market has moved into deficit of
            579,000 tons this year, with the gap increasing to 619,000 tons
            next year, while zinc will have deficit of 154,000 tons in 2015,
            according to the Goldman report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A cyclical upswing in demand in combination with low
            supply growth, following years of underinvestment in new
            capacity outside of China, has seen zinc and aluminum
            outperform' in the first half of 2014, said the Goldman
            analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut the 12-month estimate for copper to $6,200 a
            ton from $6,600 previously due to rising production and exposure
            to weak property market in China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among precious metals, palladium remains the preferred
            metal, with prices averaging $925 an ounce in 2015 and rising to
            $1,000 in 2016, according to the bank. It reiterated a call for
            gold to drop to $1,050 by the end of 2014 as the U.S. economic
            recovery accelerates. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>SEC Asks Goldman to Break Down Trading Revenue by Product</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange
            Commission asked Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to disclose how much
            products such as mortgages and commodities contribute to its
            trading revenue to give investors more clarity on how the firm
            makes most of its money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it will give 'additional qualitative
            disclosure' of the revenue by product types, according to
            correspondence with the regulators released today about the New
            York-based firm's 2012 annual filing. The SEC indicated it was
            satisfied with that response. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's institutional client services division,
            which includes stock and fixed-income trading, generated 53
            percent of the firm's revenue last year. Like most of its
            competitors, Goldman Sachs only provides a single revenue line
            for fixed-income trading, which includes products ranging from
            Treasuries to distress bonds and uranium. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC noted that the firm produced a third of its revenue
            from market-making and made the request 'in light of its
            significance.' Goldman Sachs said that its quarterly filings
            includes a breakdown of some revenue by product. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The data include market-making and 'other principal
            transactions' revenue reported through the firm's investing and
            lending unit, which houses the company's own investments. It
            excludes trading commissions and net interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $4.37 billion from interest rates,
            $5.51 billion from credit and $5.8 billion from equities,
            according to the data. It lost $1 billion from currencies, while
            producing $575 million from commodities and $1.97 billion from
            'other.' The breakdown doesn't reflect how the firm runs its
            business, Goldman Sachs said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Exec Calls Central E-Mail in Fraud Case 'Inaccurate'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            executive Fabrice Tourre denied he misled ACA Management LLC
            into backing a mortgage bond deal that later made Paulson Co.
            $1 billion as part of a massive bet against the housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Testifying yesterday in his own defense in a federal civil
            fraud trial in Manhattan, Tourre said an e-mail of his sent to
            an ACA executive in the 2007 transaction at the center of the
            case against him 'was not accurate.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Laura Schwartz, the ACA executive who's a key witness in
            the case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
            testified that the e-mail helped persuade her that Paulson was
            going to invest in the equity of the deal, a collateralized debt
            obligation known as Abacus, rather than sell it short. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The statement was false?' SEC lawyer Matthew Martens
            asked Tourre just after he took the witness stand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It was not accurate,' said Tourre, 34, who's now
            studying for a doctorate in economics at the University of
            Chicago. 'It was not an attempt to try to confuse anyone, it
            was not accurate at that time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martens questioned Tourre for almost two hours, trying to
            prove that he was the source of the misinformation about Paulson,
            a Goldman client that initiated the deal, helped choose the
            portfolio of 90 residential mortgage-backed securities
            underlying it, and then made a huge profit when Abacus failed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Purple Tie &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martens asked Tourre about the Jan. 10, 2007, e-mail that
            was forwarded to ACA, the portfolio selection agent, showing the
            planned capital structure of the deal, including a
            'precommitted first loss' or equity tranche. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre, dressed in a black suit, white shirt and purple tie,
            testified in French-accented English. Early in his testimony, he
            knocked a closed water carafe off the witness box, and grinned
            with embarrassment after it crashed to the floor. Martens walked
            over to retrieve it, unsmiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anthony Sabino, who teaches law at St. John's University in
            New York, said Tourre's statement that he sent an inaccurate e-mail may alienate jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It seems evasive,' said Sabino. 'When a jury of regular
            New Yorkers hears a highly educated, highly compensated Wall
            Street figure say something is 'inaccurate,' they normally
            interpret that in the worst possible way.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is covering the fees for Tourre's
            lawyers and public relations team, agreed to pay $550 million in
            2010 to settle SEC claims stemming from the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paulson, run by billionaire John Paulson, made $15 billion
            on short bets against the residential mortgage market in 2006
            and 2007. Paulson hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing in
            connection with the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Good, Not Too Good &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre frequently disagreed with how Martens characterized
            aspects of the transaction. He said that ACA, in selecting
            mortgage-backed securities for the Abacus portfolio, wanted
            securities that were good, but not too good. Abacus had to
            attract short investors to balance the investors who were
            betting the assets would perform well, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the portfolio is just too good, then there's no
            transaction,' Tourre said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre, who graduated from an elite engineering school in
            his native France, came to the U.S. to earn a master's degree
            from Stanford University. He spent time before the trial
            volunteering in Rwanda and is now a student at Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Talking Latin &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At one point in today's testimony, Tourre explained the
            abbreviation 'i.e.,' which he used in an e-mail: 'It stands
            for 'id est' in Latin.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre followed Schwartz to the witness stand and will
            continue tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, who headed ACA's asset management business in
            early 2007, testified she didn't know Paulson was taking a
            short-only position in Abacus. The misimpression led ACA to lend
            its prestige to the deal and to make a disastrous bet that the
            portfolio would perform well, the SEC says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Paulson never corrected ACA's
            misimpression through e-mails, phone conversations and meetings,
            including a chance encounter between Schwartz and a top Paulson
            executive in a Jackson Hole, Wyoming, hotel bar, Schwartz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under questioning today by Tourre's lawyer, John 'Sean'
            Coffey, Schwartz said she can't recall any specific conversation
            or meetings in which she was told that Paulson was investing in
            the equity of Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Slender Reed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's been no direct evidence tying Fabrice Tourre to
            any fraud against ACA,' said Michael Santoro, a lawyer and
            professor at Rutgers Business School who's been attending the
            trial. 'At the moment, we have only the slenderest reed to even
            believe he misled ACA that Paulson was long.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz said that Tourre failed to correct an e-mail she
            sent referring to 'Paulson's equity perspective' on the deal.
            Tourre testified today that he can't remember reading the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz testified she is sure she was never told that
            Paulson planned to make a short-only bet on Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A pure short was a bet against something that was
            designed to fail,' Schwartz testified. 'It would have been a
            shock if I had learned that they were only short in the AC1-Abacus transaction.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Wider Ruble Band After Rate Boost</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's surprise interest rate
            increase paves the way for policy makers to widen the band in
            which the currency trades and reduces the need to intervene,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble has tumbled almost 4 percent against the dollar
            in the past month, the worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after
            President Vladimir
            Putin's annexation of Crimea spurred violence along the border
            with Ukraine. Bank Rossii boosted the one-week auction rate to 8
            percent from 7.5 percent yesterday and may keep raising
            borrowing costs as currency weakness spurs inflation, according
            to a central bank statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision gives the bank room to make its exchange-rate
            policy more flexible as it moves towards a free-floating rate by
            year-end, according to New York-based Goldman Sachs. Enabling
            the ruble to strengthen will aid the central bank in its fight
            against price increases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The surprise rate change makes it likely that the central
            bank 'will proceed with further steps towards introduction of
            currency flexibility in the short term, with a decision to
            reduce the cumulative interventions needed to shift the
            intervention corridor, for example, likely as early as next
            week,' economists led by Clemens Grafe at Goldman Sachs in
            Moscow wrote in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wider Band &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank widened the corridor within which it will
            not intervene to 5.1 rubles, up from 3.1 rubles last month. It
            is required to buy or sell dollars to keep the ruble inside that
            range. It aims to abolish the band by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia spent $30.7 billion between Feb. 28 and May 8 to
            stem the ruble's decline. Since then, it hasn't sold dollars to
            support its currency. The country's foreign reserves fell $39
            billion to $472 billion in June, according to central bank data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer prices grew 7.8 percent from a year earlier in
            June, the most since August 2011. Inflation slowed on an annual
            basis to 7.5 percent as of July 21, the central bank said,
            adding that it will probably decelerate to a range of 6 percent
            to 6.5 percent by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble slipped 0.5 percent to 35.1435 per dollar
            yesterday, extending its decline this year to 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's policy makers are aiming to let the ruble decline
            because a weaker currency will increase the government's revenue
            from energy exports, according to Ian Hague, who helps manage
            $1.1 billion including Russian stocks as the founding partner of
            New York-based Firebird Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect the ruble to depreciate,' Hague said in a
            phone interview yesterday. 'They are just plugging the holes.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tourre Tells of Low Status at Goldman in Defense Preview</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre previewed his defense against civil fraud claims over a failed $1 billion
            investment, telling jurors about his former life as a 28-year-old Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice
            president, working until midnight, six days a week on a vast trading floor, supervising no one. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I would say there were thousands of vice presidents at Goldman,' Tourre, now 34, testified late
            yesterday in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claims
            Tourre intentionally misled participants in a 2007 deal known as Abacus about the role played by Paulson
            Co., the hedge fund run by John Paulson. The SEC claims Tourre hid that Paulson helped choose the portfolio
            of subprime mortgage-backed securities underlying Abacus, then made a billion-dollar bet it would fail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre's lead lawyer, Pamela Chepiga, began questioning her client yesterday afternoon, seeking to
            minimize Tourre's responsibility for the transaction by showing it was reviewed by dozens of people at
            Goldman Sachs. Tourre's testimony continues today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abacus, which closed in April 2007,
            turned worthless when the housing market crashed, losing $1 billion for investors who bet the subprime
            mortgage bond portfolio would perform well. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>TT Electronics Rises on Goldman Sachs Buy Rating: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;TT Electronics Plc (TTG), a British maker
            of components for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG,
            advanced for a second day after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            upgraded its recommendation to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock climbed 3.3 percent, taking the two-day gain to
            7.2 percent, the biggest such advance since May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect modest progression in autos volumes, supported
            by encouraging recent data for Europe,' Will Wyman, an analyst
            at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to investors today.
            Restructuring programs 'will support further margin
            expansion.' Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction
            list with a six-month price target increased to 240 pence from
            190 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Europe accounted for 66 percent of Weybridge, England-based
            TT Electronics' 476.9 million pounds ($734 million) of revenue
            last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock closed at 170.50 pence in London, taking the
            advance to 18 percent this year and giving the company a market
            value of 269.7 million pounds ($415 million). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among six analysts who review the company and share their
            findings with Bloomberg, five recommend buying the stock and one

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said in Talks to Settle FHFA Mortgage Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks to settle a U.S. regulator's claims the investment bank
            sold faulty mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and will probably pay $800 million to
            $1.25 billion, according to a person briefed on the discussions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high end of the
            range would be on par with the agreement Morgan Stanley (MS) reached this year after being sued over a
            similar amount of mortgage bonds as New York-based Goldman Sachs. The final amount may change as an
            agreement is reached, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the settlement talks are
            private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Federal Housing Finance Agency sued 18 banks in 2011 seeking to recoup
            taxpayer costs from when the government took control of the failing mortgage-finance companies in 2008.
            Seven banks, including JPMorgan Chase Co. and Deutsche Bank AG, agreed to pay a total of almost $8 billion
            last year to settle claims they made misrepresentations about mortgages underlying securities bought by
            Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the lead-up to the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The $800 million figure
            would surpass Goldman Sachs's $550 million payment in 2010 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission
            suit over the marketing of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, Goldman's cost could be lower than what rival banks paid, as a percentage of the face value
            of securities bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA said in its original suit that the two
            companies bought $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs, and an $800 million settlement would be 7.2 percent of
            that total. Some banks have settled at amounts that represented between 12 percent and 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan, BofA &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley in February agreed to pay $1.25 billion as part
            of a settlement over $10.6 billion in securities. JPMorgan agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle
            claims related to about $33 billion in mortgage bonds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. in March
            announced a $9.5 billion accord, including paying $6.3 billion in cash to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and
            buying back $3.2 billion of mortgage bonds from them. The housing finance companies bought about $57 billion
            of bonds from Bank of America and its predecessor firms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for
            Goldman Sachs, didn't return messages after normal business hours seeking comment on the possible range of
            costs, which was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal. Stefanie Johnson, an FHFA spokeswoman, said
            the agency wouldn't comment on the Goldman Sachs case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Denise
            Cote in Manhattan has set a Sept. 29 trial date for Goldman Sachs. All but four of the FHFA cases have
            settled, Cote said yesterday in a ruling. The remaining cases involve Goldman Sachs, HSBC North America
            Holdings Inc., Nomura Holding America Inc. and RBS Securities Inc., she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs said earlier this month that it set aside $284 million in the second quarter for litigation and
            regulatory proceedings, up from $149 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
            have taken $187.5 billion in U.S. aid and have returned more than $200 billion under terms of their federal
            conservatorship. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman's ReNew Warns India Wind Order Will Prompt Losses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s ReNew
            Wind Power Pvt. said an Indian rule requiring wind farms to
            predict output will lead to penalties that will wipe out profits
            in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ReNew joins Tata Power Co. (TPWR), both among India's largest
            renewable-energy utilities, in voicing concern as wind-farm
            developers seek a court injunction against the directive
            ordering day-ahead forecasts for generation. India's electricity
            regulator will fine developers if predictions aren't correct. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The level of accuracy they're asking for isn't
            possible,' said Sumant Sinha, chief executive officer of ReNew,
            which is backed by a $385 million investment from Goldman Sachs.
            'Most people will end up paying very significant charges.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission imposed the
            order this month. The directive, applying to farms built since
            May 3, 2010, will affect developers including ReNew, Tata, CLP
            Holdings Ltd. (2) and Morgan Stanley-backed Continuum Wind Energy
            Pte, which have added some of the largest projects in that time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Penalties may amount to as much as 15 percent of revenue,
            destroying profitability in an industry that has attracted about
            $10 billion of investment since 2011, Sinha said. ReNew, which
            doesn't disclose its operating capacity, will find it 'tough'
            to meet its own target of adding 200 megawatts a year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Court Injunction &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wind Independent Power Producers Association has filed
            for an injunction at the Delhi High Court, Sunil Jain, the
            lobby's president, said in a July 25 e-mail. Another industry
            body, the Chennai-based Independent Wind Power Association, is
            considering doing similar, said Chairman K. Kasthurirangaian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Objections from the industry have already delayed the order
            by two years and developers have had sufficient time to prepare,
            Rajiv Bansal, the regulator's secretary, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forecasting of wind generation, an intermittent energy
            source, is carried out in parts of Europe and the U.S. to help
            stabilize the grid. In India, scheduling will allow wind power
            to be sold across states and help authorities prepare network
            upgrades to accept more clean energy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wind farms of 10 megawatts or more will predict their
            generation for the following day every 15 minutes. Missing
            estimates by more than 30 percent will incur penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign wind-forecasting specialists such as GL Garrad
            Hassan and AWS Truepower can't guarantee that kind of precision,
            Sinha said. In the low-wind season, generation would only have
            to swing by a 3 percent margin to incur fines because of
            seasonal variations in turbine efficiency, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Nowhere else do they do it at this granular level,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The measure is necessary for the industry's long-term
            growth, said V. Subramanian, chairman of the Indian Wind Energy
            Association. 'It's not a question of possible or impossible,'
            he said in an e-mail. 'The Indian power sector works with
            scheduling of generation and consumption at 15-minute intervals.
            Renewable energy cannot be different from other sources of
            energy.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Denies Ex-Employee Claims of Sex Bias</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) denied
            gender bias in compensation and tolerating a 'boys' club'
            atmosphere of excessive drinking and strip-club trips as it
            sought to quash a bid to unite female associates and vice
            presidents in a class action for discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rejected claims by former employees Cristina
            Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, opposing their court request to
            expand a lawsuit to represent more than 2,300 current and former
            female associates and vice presidents who worked at Goldman
            Sachs in the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'To be clear: Goldman Sachs does not tolerate
            discrimination of any kind,' the firm said in papers filed July
            25 in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chen-Oster and Orlich, who sued in 2010, claim they have
            expert statistical analyses that showed a pattern of
            discrimination against women in earnings and promotions. They
            alleged that the bank tolerated a work environment where women
            are treated as 'second-class employees.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 36 percent of professionals employed by New York-based Goldman Sachs are women, the firm said
            on its website,
            citing August 2013 figures. Women constitute 23 percent of
            officials and managers, and 21 percent of executive and senior
            officials and managers, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Percentages &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former Goldman Sachs employees cited their own
            percentages in court filings. They claimed female vice
            presidents earned 21 percent less than men, and female
            associates made 8 percent less. About 23 percent fewer female
            vice presidents were promoted to managing director relative to
            their male counterparts, they said in their complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs asked U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to
            rule that Chen-Oster and Orlich should pursue their claims
            individually, rather than as representatives of all female
            Goldmans Sachs associates and vice presidents. Plaintiffs have
            more leverage in class actions because they can pool legal
            resources, more easily forcing a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank argued that the women haven't shown a general
            policy of discrimination or evidence that women were affected
            negatively as a class. Their allegations are individual claims
            that don't apply to the other women, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Denials &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank also specifically denied many of the allegations
            in the complaint, including claims that male employees took
            clients to strip clubs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm said it prohibits employees from business outings
            involving 'sexually oriented entertainment, such as
            entertainment at topless bars or lap-dancing bars.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also submitted statements from female
            employees who said they haven't been discriminated against or
            subject to harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm said it has conducted diversity training programs
            for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have never heard anyone even mention the
            possibility of going to a strip club,' Samantha Davidson, an
            extended managing director, said in a written declaration. 'I
            do not feel excluded from social events, such as events with
            clients and informal get-togethers after work with co-workers,
            including golf events.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs Co., 10-cv-06950,
            U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Intervale Said Working With Goldman on Proserv Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firm Intervale
            Capital LLC is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to seek
            buyers for Proserv Group AS, a supplier of equipment for
            undersea oil drilling, according to people familiar with the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;First-round bids for the business, which could be valued at
            about $750 million, are due this month, the people said, asking
            not to be identified discussing a private matter. The group is
            attracting interest from other private-equity investors and
            Goldman Sachs is offering financing to potential buyers, one of
            the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dealmaking is picking up in the energy-equipment sector as
            a growing amount of oil and gas production comes from deepwater
            and unconventional reserves, which require extensive
            infrastructure to exploit. Last month Canadian engineering group
            SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) agreed to pay about $1.97 billion for
            Kentz Corp. (KENZ), which supplies apparatus and engineers for energy
            projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives from Goldman Sachs did not immediately
            return requests for comment via e-mail and telephone. Intervale
            did not return an e-mail seeking comment outside of regular
            business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Intervale, a specialized oil and gas services investment
            firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, first invested in
            Proserv in 2009. Aberdeen, Scotland-based Proserv had earnings
            before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about $70
            million last year, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blackstone Hires Ex-Goldman's Burton for Secondary Deals</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP (BX) hired Mark
            Burton from H/2 Capital Partners LLC to oversee the private-equity firm's real estate secondaries business.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Burton, who previously spent 11 years at Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS), will be a principal in Blackstone's Strategic
            Partners business, according to a statement today from the New
            York-based firm. At H/2 Burton was a managing director focusing
            on distressed commercial mortgage investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone acquired the Strategic Partners unit last year
            from Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), expanding its traditional buyout
            business to include the practice of buying and selling stakes in
            private-equity funds. The market for secondary fund stakes is
            expected to grow in the next year as heightened regulatory
            measures such as the Volcker Rule lead banks to dispose of their
            private-equity investments to raise capital, according to a
            report last month from research firm Preqin Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone's unit, run by Stephen Can and Verdun Perry,
            oversees $15.5 billion in committed capital and is raising its
            sixth fund with a $4.4 billion target, according to Blackstone's
            second-quarter earnings statement. The group competes with firms
            including Ardian, Lexington Partners Inc. and Coller Capital
            Ltd., which have the three biggest mounds of uncalled capital,
            according to Preqin. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Strategic Partners has produced an internal rate of return
            of 14 percent, according to Blackstone's earnings statement. The
            group is investing its fourth real estate fund after starting to
            buy property fund stakes in 2000, according to the statement
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The addition of Mark to our business will significantly
            strengthen our current real estate activities and allow us to
            continue capitalizing on opportunities in the real estate
            secondaries market,' Perry said in today's statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says China Growth Must Slow Below 7% to Meet Goal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;China should allow economic growth
            to slow to below 7 percent to reduce reliance on investment
            spending, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Ha Jiming. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Achieving Premier Li Keqiang's target of 7.5 percent gross
            domestic product growth for this year could further aggravate
            imbalances and a rate 'below 7 percent' is roughly what China
            needs, said Ha, the Hong Kong-based vice chairman and chief
            investment strategist at Goldman's investment management
            division for China. Next year, 'I hope the target could be
            lowered to reflect the need for economic rebalance,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling Communist Party, which last year laid out the
            broadest economic changes since the 1990s, has been drawn back
            into providing greater support for the economy as expansion is
            threatened by a plunge in property construction and weaker home-price gains. The government has brought
            forward spending, cut
            reserve requirements for some lenders and lowered taxes, helping
            drive a gauge of manufacturing to an 18-month high. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's very difficult for China to strike a balance between
            short-term growth and long-term reform needs,' Ha said in an
            interview yesterday in Sydney. 'According to my estimate, if
            China wants to lower the share of investment in GDP over the
            medium term, growth should not exceed 7 percent.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The risks embedded in the current Chinese growth model are
            being exacerbated the longer the government seeks to maintain
            growth at 7.5 percent, Angus Bell, an investment manager at
            Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said yesterday in the same
            interview. Goldman Sachs AM invests or advises on assets worth
            more than $900 billion, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Slower Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that Chinese
            GDP will expand by 7.4 percent this year, the slowest pace since
            1990. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its forecasts
            to 7.4 percent for this year and 7.1 percent for 2015, the
            Washington-based fund said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's leaders are seeking to rebalance the economy away
            from exports and domestic investment, toward services and
            consumption. To put the nation on a more sustainable growth
            path, the government needs to prevent further excesses in
            production capacity, debt and housing supply, according to Ha. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the first half of this year, I would say the focus was
            on safeguarding growth,' said Ha. 'Given that the stimulus
            policies are taking effect and growth is likely to be maintained
            at the targeted level of 7.5 percent, in the second half of this
            year some reform measures as announced a year ago could be put
            in place.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Housing Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Liberalization of interest rates and the currency and a
            loosening of some regulations on foreign and domestic investors
            will probably be among the initial changes considered, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The key risks in China that concern Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management center around housing, which is an important source
            of demand for various industries and linked to local and central
            government revenues, Bell said in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorities are currently seeking to avert a collapse of
            the real-estate market after data showed housing prices fell in
            55 of 70 cities last month from May, the most since January 2011
            when the government changed the way it compiles the statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG estimates real-estate accounts for more than a
            quarter of final demand in the economy when including property-generated needs for goods including electric
            machinery and
            instruments, chemicals and metals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The size is very big compared to many other countries,'
            said Ha, who predicts that home sellers will start to outnumber
            buyers as China's baby-boom generation retires. 'That
            demographic inflection point will have very significant
            implications for the Chinese property market and related
            industries.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Nickel Rising With Palladium to Beat Soy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel and palladium are set to
            outperform iron ore and soybeans as supply outlooks for
            commodities diverge amid a tentative acceleration in global
            economic growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank kept its 12-month recommendation for commodities
            at neutral, analysts including Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report
            dated yesterday. They expect the total return for the Standard
            Poor's GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index to be 0.1 percent in 12
            months helped by positive roll yields. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. said last month that interest is returning
            to the asset class as Societe Generale SA called commodities a
            'really mixed bag' across the sectors. Raw materials are
            already trading independently, with a ban on ore exports from
            Indonesia spurring a rally in nickel, while expectations for a
            deepening global glut have sent iron ore into a bear market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While cyclical recovery tends to see rising commodity
            demand, prices will likely largely be determined by more
            structural supply factors,' the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.
            'Accordingly, not all boats are expected rise with the tide
            created by continued improvement in global macroeconomic data.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities as measured by the enhanced index added 2.4
            percent this year as global equities increased 5.6 percent and
            the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose 3.5 percent.
            Shortages are seen nickel, zinc, aluminum and palladium, while
            most other raw materials including copper, iron ore, oil and
            soybeans, are expected to be in surplus, Goldman says. Nickel
            fell 1.2 percent today and palladium advanced 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Increasing Allocations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've seen increasing allocations from asset managers
            this year and some new fund interest come into commodities,'
            Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president in New
            York, said in a phone interview June 24. 'We've seen
            geopolitics and weather really come to the fore this year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Societe Generale is overweight agriculture, and energy to a
            slightly lesser extent, and massively underweight precious
            metals, according to Michael Haigh, head of commodities
            research, in a June 17 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While financial markets have reacted favorably to signs of
            macroeconomic acceleration in both the U.S. and China, with the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index reaching a record, commodity indexes
            have remained mostly flat on expectations for increases in
            supplies in most raw materials, the Goldman analysts said.
            Nickel, zinc, aluminum and palladium do not fit into this view
            as deficits are predicted over the next three years, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Carry Return &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley also expects nickel, zinc and palladium to
            advance. While nickel 'may have run ahead of itself,' a
            shortage next year may keep its uptrend intact, analysts
            including Joel Crane said in a report yesterday. Zinc will
            continue to outperform as the shortfall intensifies and solid
            supply and demand fundamentals support palladium, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI enhanced index has rebounded in 2014 from two
            years of losses as key markets are in backwardation, a structure
            where short-term supplies cost more than later deliveries, which
            has provided so-called positive carry and continued to generate
            returns, according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Prices Its Biggest Australian Bond Sale Since 2011</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised
            A$750 million ($680 million) in its biggest Australian bond sale
            in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five-year debt transaction was priced to yield 170
            basis points more than swaps, according to Goldman Sachs
            spokeswoman Hayley Morris. The bank sold A$450 million of fixed-rate notes and A$300 million of
            floating-rate securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street lender that generates most of its revenue
            from trading last sold similar debt in November, when it priced
            A$600 million of bonds with the same tenor at a 195 basis-point
            spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It sold A$1.25 billion
            of notes in May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. was the last U.S. bank to sell bonds
            in Australia, pricing A$850 million of 2018 notes on May 14,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Following record debt
            sales in May, issuance in the South Pacific nation dropped to
            the least since December 2011 last month as concern the Federal
            Reserve will reduce stimulus roiled global markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average spread for financial-company bonds in Australia
            spiked to as high as 130 basis points more than swaps on July 2
            before narrowing to 114 yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            index data show. While the premium is nearing its level before
            Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke spoke about tapering at his June 19
            news conference, issuance has remained muted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs holds the seventh-highest credit rating at
            Moody's Investors Service and Standard Poor's. Bank of America
            carries the same A- ranking as Goldman Sachs at SP and is
            graded two levels lower at Moody's. The 5-1/4 year paper it sold
            in May was priced at a spread of 190 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's Goldman Sachs transaction was managed by the lender
            itself, Australia New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., National
            Australia Bank Ltd. and Royal Bank of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Donald Mulvihill, Goldman Manager Who Started Funds, Dies at 56</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Donald J. Mulvihill, a Goldman Sachs (GS)
            Group Inc. managing director who started the firm's asset-management business in Japan and created
            tax-focused funds in
            the U.S., has died. He was 56. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He died on July 19 at Loyola University Medical Center in
            Maywood, Illinois, 15 months after being diagnosed with
            leukemia, according to his wife, the former Jill Kane. A
            resident of Glen Ellyn, Illinois, he retired from New York-based
            Goldman Sachs on July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a 33-year career with Goldman, the fifth-biggest U.S.
            bank by assets, Mulvihill became a specialist on pension and
            retirement planning, introducing new investment products in the
            U.S. and Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Don will be remembered not only for his commercial
            contributions, but also for his commitment to our people,'
            Timothy J. O'Neil and Eric S. Lane, co-heads of Goldman's
            Investment Management Division, wrote in a company e-mail on
            July 19. 'Don was known throughout the firm for his kindness
            and thoughtfulness. He has been, and will continue to be, an
            inspiration for us all.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As president of Goldman Sachs Asset Management Japan Ltd.
            from 1992 to 1997, he dealt first-hand with Japan's 'lost
            decade' of recessions following the collapse of the nation's
            asset bubble in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nasdaq Lowered to Sell by Goldman Sachs on Lower Profit Margins</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
            selling shares of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., saying the company's
            diversification strategy will reduce profit margins and may
            cause the exchange operator to miss earnings forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Blostein cut his rating on
            the second-largest U.S. exchange operator to sell from neutral
            and reduced his price estimate to $28 a share from $30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Street is too optimistic on the firm's operating
            margin outlook as NDAQ's business mix continues to shift toward
            lower-margin revenue streams, creating risks to 2014 and 2015
            EPS estimates,' Blostein wrote in a research note today, using
            the company's ticker symbol. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nasdaq shares fell 2.8 percent to $32.10 as of 9:31 a.m. in
            New York. They have gained 29 percent this year, almost double
            the 17 percent advance in the Bloomberg World Exchanges Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's stock has fallen 2.5 percent since the July
            23 close, before it reported second-quarter earnings the next
            day that missed analyst estimates. It was the first time profit
            came in below expectations in five quarters and only the second
            time in 13 quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The results were hurt by costs associated with acquisitions
            that are part of Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld's
            strategy to diversify the company. In recent months, Nasdaq has
            bought U.S. Treasury trading platform eSpeed and Thomson Reuters
            Corp.'s shareholder-relations business. It also took a 25
            percent stake in Dutch alternative trading system The Order
            Machine, which focuses on options. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Businesses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The moves into new business won't make up for shortcomings
            in other areas, said Blostein, because of the smaller margins.
            In the wake of the eSpeed and Thomson Reuters deals, he
            estimates a 39 percent margin compared with 45 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue at the firm's information services, market services
            and listings businesses, which together comprise 83 percent of
            Nasdaq's 2012 sales, have been flat over the last two years,
            Blostein wrote, citing 'challenging trading trends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While other businesses have a blended profit margin of 58
            percent, the former Thomson Reuters unit acquired by Nasdaq
            means 'the firm's Tech Solutions business continues to gain
            share of the overall revenue pie, with only 7 percent operating
            margin.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blostein said Goldman Sachs's models suggest Nasdaq's
            expenses in 2014 will be on average 3 percent higher than
            current analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blostein's call is the only sell rating on the stock among
            18 analyst opinions compiled by Bloomberg. Nine rate the stock a
            buy and eight have hold ratings. The average 12-month price
            estimate is $34.57 a share. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Kurdish Oil Production Seen Doubling Next Year by Goldman Sachs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurds,
            sparring with the nation's central government over their right
            to export crude, may almost double oil production next year and
            triple it this decade, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Kurdistan Regional Government could bolster output to
            about 540,000 barrels a day by the end of 2015 if it can expand
            pipeline capacity and surmount marketing constraints, analysts
            including New York-based Head of Commodities Research Jeff
            Currie said in a report yesterday. The KRG and authorities in
            Baghdad have clashed over the Kurds' attempts to sell oil
            independently, including over a tanker currently anchored off
            Galveston, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iraq will be the biggest source of new capacity this decade
            in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the group
            responsible for 40 percent of the world's oil, according to the
            International Energy Agency. Brazil will the second-largest
            source of supply growth outside OPEC after North America,
            boosting output by 48 percent to 3.1 million barrels a day by
            2019, the IEA predicts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With Brazil and South Iraq, it's the largest growth
            potential in the industry outside North America,' Michele Della Vigna, the bank's head of European energy
            research, said in an
            interview in London yesterday. 'There will be enough buyers of
            Kurdish crude in the market. The greatest uncertainty at this
            point in time surrounds the payment mechanism to the producers
            and security of installations and pipelines.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reaching 540,000 barrels a day by the end of 2015 will
            require that Kurds have access to the main export pipeline to
            Turkey's port of Ceyhan, and that the Baiji refinery is
            restarted, Goldman Sachs said. Output will be limited to 110,000
            barrels a day at the end of next year if those conditions aren't
            met. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Production could exceed 1 million barrels a day by the end
            of the decade, Goldman's Della Vigna said. The Kurds are
            producing about 280,000 barrels a day currently, according to
            the report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Gary Cohn Says SAC Capital 'Great Counterparty'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
            Gary Cohn said his firm continues to do business with SAC
            Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund that was indicted on charges
            of insider trading last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're an important client to us, they have been an
            important client to us,' Cohn, 52, said today in an interview
            on CNBC. 'We continue to trade with them, and they're a great
            counterparty.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which gets more than half its revenue from
            trading, is the first Wall Street firm to comment publicly on
            its dealings with the $14 billion hedge fund company founded by
            Steven A. Cohen. Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase Co. and
            Morgan Stanley (MS) were among firms that were continuing to trade
            with SAC Capital after the indictment, four people briefed on
            the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAC Capital denied it encouraged or tolerated insider
            trading and said it will continue to operate as it works through
            the allegations. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            filed an administrative complaint against Cohen, seeking to ban
            him from overseeing investor funds for allegedly failing to
            supervise employees and prevent them from engaging in insider
            trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hedge fund has been among the largest trading clients
            for New York-based Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, according
            to people with knowledge of the relationships. SAC Capital,
            based in Stamford, Connecticut, has used those firms, along with
            JPMorgan, Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc, as prime
            brokers, Reuters reported in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Likes China Banks as Earnings Growth to Exceed Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Chinese banks
            as earnings may beat projections for the MSCI China Index while
            reforms to interest rates fail to crimp profit margins,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese lenders may have high single-digit earnings growth
            this year compared with Goldman Sachs's 4 percent estimate for
            companies in the MSCI China Index, Helen Zhu, the bank's chief
            China strategist said yesterday. A measure of financial
            companies that accounts for 40 percent of the MSCI China has
            slumped 13 percent this year through yesterday, compared with a
            35 percent surge by information-technology shares and 17 percent
            rise by utilities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese listed banks may see net-income growth slowing to
            around 8 percent this year, the official Xinhua News Agency
            reported yesterday, citing a report released by the China
            Banking Association. While the People's Bank of China scrapped a
            floor on borrowing costs on July 19, the central bank said the
            country isn't ready to do the same with a cap on what banks can
            pay for deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're looking for banks' earnings to grow faster than the
            overall market-earnings growth this year,' said Zhu. Banks'
            preparation for a cyclical downturn, sufficient coverage ratios
            and a slower loosening of interest-rate controls for deposits
            may support their earnings, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Expectations that deregulation of rates would compress net
            interest margins -- the difference between what banks pay for
            deposits and charge for loans -- may be misplaced, Zhu said.
            Lenders hadn't previously taken advantage of leeway they had to
            charge less, suggesting that even more freedom won't translate
            into lower profit, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lending Statistics &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the first quarter of 2013, about 11 percent of bank
            loans were made below the benchmark rate, and about 64 percent
            above it, PBOC data show. The central bank currently sets the
            one-year lending rate at 6 percent, with a one-year deposit rate
            of 3 percent, which banks aren't allowed to exceed by more than
            10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's two biggest lenders, Industrial Commercial Bank
            of China Ltd. (601398) and China Construction Bank Corp. (939), reported first-quarter profit growth of 12
            percent and 16 percent,
            respectively, while net income at the third- and fourth- largest
            banks increased 8.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four largest lenders, which include Agricultural Bank
            of China Ltd. (1288) and Bank of China Ltd. (3988), traded at 5.21 times
            estimated earnings on average, compared with their five-year
            average of 8.24 times and MSCI China's 11.6 times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's 12-month forward target for MSCI China is 59,
            according to Zhu. That's 3.5 percent higher than yesterday's
            close. The target for the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) is
            10,200, a 5.5 percent increase from yesterday. Previous targets
            for the indexes were 69 and 12,400. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The key driver of the trend is not going to be beta but
            it's going to be alpha, it's going to be looking for
            structurally appealing areas and stocks that will have reform-driven upside,' Zhu said. 'A lot of these
            potential reform
            impacts are not currently reflected in the earnings consensus so
            we see a lot of opportunity for earnings to be revised.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Offers Aluminum to Clients Stuck in Queue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) offered to
            speed up delivery of aluminum to users of the metal and proposed
            changes to industry rules amid claims that its warehouse unit
            created shortages and drove up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So far no client has accepted the bank's offer to swap
            their metal stuck in queues for immediately available aluminum,
            Goldman Sachs President Gary D. Cohn, 52, said today in a CNBC
            interview. Consumers should have priority over other clients in
            getting aluminum out of warehouses and the London Metal Exchange
            system needs more transparency, Goldman Sachs said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We feel horrible for consumers if they can't get metal,'
            Cohn said. 'We don't believe that to be the fact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The beverage industry has complained that banks and other
            warehouse owners are manipulating aluminum supplies and slowing
            deliveries to drive up the price. Goldman Sachs said that while
            longer queues in recent years have been a factor in the premium
            of physical metal over the spot price, the waits are not driving
            up the price of aluminum, which has fallen since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a recognition of a longstanding problem in the
            market that needs to be solved,' said Diego Valiante, head of
            capital markets at the Center for European Policy Studies in
            Brussels. 'Clearly there is also the understanding of the
            urgency in solving this issue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Premiums Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Detroit, New Orleans, the Dutch port of Vlissingen, the
            Belgian city of Antwerp and Malaysia's Johor have the longest
            waits for metal, according to Barclays Plc. Detroit is dominated
            by Goldman Sachs's Metro International Trade Services LLC, while
            Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)'s Pacorini Metals has the most storage
            units in Vlissingen, New Orleans and Johor. In Antwerp, it is
            NEMS, a unit of Trafigura Beheer BV. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aluminum for delivery in three months fell 13 percent this
            year on the LME as stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the
            exchange neared a record. The premiums added to the LME price
            surged to a record 12 cents to 13 cents a pound in June, almost
            double the 6.5 cents in the summer of 2010, according to data
            from Austin, Texas-based researcher Harbor Intelligence. The
            surcharge fell for the first time this year in the week ending
            July 19, according to Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Glencore, the largest owner of LME warehouses, declined to
            comment through a spokesman. Trafigura continues to offer prompt
            delivery of metal to its customers, an official at the
            Singapore-based commodities trader said. Henry Bath warehouses,
            owned by JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), don't currently have queues,
            according to a person familiar with the business who wasn't
            authorized to comment and requested anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Costs Inflated &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's offer is 'great news and any pricing
            manifestations due to warehousing issues will hopefully resolve
            going forward,' said Bart Chilton, a member of the Commodity
            Futures Trading Commission. 'This entire matter continues to
            raise the larger issue of banks owning physical commodities,
            warehousing and delivery mechanisms.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Costs were inflated by $3 billion worldwide in the past
            year because of the backup in aluminum supplies, Tim Weiner, a
            global risk manager at brewer MillerCoors LLC, told a U.S.
            Senate panel last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has secured metal directly from producers to
            be able to swap with end-user clients, Cohn said. The firm has
            made the offer at the LME spot price with no premium, according
            to a person briefed on the talks who asked not to be named
            because the offers were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Considered Selling &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are consulting with the metals trade and industry on a
            proposal to amend the delivery out obligations of warehouse
            companies with long queues, and we encourage market users to
            contact us with their views,' Miriam Heywood, a spokeswoman for
            the LME, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In February 2010, Goldman Sachs bought Romulus, Michigan-based Metro International Trade Services
            LLC, which as of July
            11 operated 34 out of 39 storage facilities licensed by the LME
            in the Detroit area, according to exchange data. Goldman Sachs
            said in today's statement that it isn't involved with the daily
            management of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earlier this year considered selling Metro,
            according to a person briefed on the discussions. The bank must
            sell the company within 10 years of its purchase, it said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last week that it plans to get out of the
            business of owning and trading physical commodities ranging from
            metals to oil, days after a Senate panel questioned whether
            banks are abusing their ownership of raw materials to manipulate
            markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Incentives Offered &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn said that while his firm will sell Metro at the
            'appropriate time,' it doesn't have plans to exit other
            commodity businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Commodity hedging is a core competency and one of the
            most important things we do in the firm, and our clients really
            need us to be in that business,' Cohn said. 'We are staying in
            the commodity-hedging business.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Low interest rates have encouraged some investors to buy
            and store aluminum with the intent of selling it at a later
            date, Goldman Sachs said in its statement. Warehousing
            companies, which don't own the metal they hold, offered
            incentives to attract supply, according to research from Societe
            Generale SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many market participants have sought to move metal to non-LME warehouses, where storage rates are
            lower, prompting the
            longer queues, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to Greenspan Catch Equity Acrophobia in Flat July</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Calling for a correction in equities at the right time is about as easy as brushing your teeth with
            your mustache. Yet that didn't stop many market watchers in July as U.S. benchmark indexes clung to records.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Alan Greenspan, a fear of heights spread this month as
            the Standard Poor's 500 Index closed in on its third year without a significant dip. The benchmark gauge of
            volatility reflected the concern, with the VIX jumping 34 percent for its biggest monthly gain since January
            yet still holding well below its lifetime average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many potential catalysts were
            proffered. However, as the final trades of the month hit the tape, none of them have yet proven to be the
            smoking gun. An interest rate spike caused by the slow drain of the Federal Reserve punch bowl? Treasury
            10-year yields held pretty flat below 2.6 percent. An oil shock as the world goes up in flames? Both West
            Texas Intermediate and Brent crude lost more than 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But wait! Corn is poised
            for its biggest monthly decline in almost three years! What calamity could be causing this 13 percent drop
            and is it the catalyst everyone's been waiting for to knock the chip off the stock market's shoulder? Well,
            as Bloomberg News describes it, the reason for the drop is 'expectations supplies will be ample amid an
            outlook for a bumper harvest in the U.S., the top grower.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OK fine. Whatever. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Long Time &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main rationale for many of the correction predictions is based
            on the logic that, well, corrections happen. And we haven't had one in a long time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet
            the fundamentals are sort of getting in the way. U.S. gross domestic product surged 4 percent last quarter,
            earnings are up 10 percent for the SP 500 companies that have reported results for the latest quarter and
            sales have increased 4.9 percent. Signs of growth sent the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index up 1.9 percent in
            July, its biggest monthly gain in a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile across the pond, euro-area
            government bonds were up for a seventh straight month and headed for their longest streak of gains in nine
            years after weak data signaled the European Central Bank will have to soldier on with stimulus. The Stoxx
            Europe 600 Index is headed for a 1.8 percent July drop, its worst month since January, while the MSCI
            Emerging Markets Index is up 1.5 percent in July. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Yield Curve &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;And
            not all was flat in the Treasury market. Thirty-year bonds had a nice rally, while five-year notes fell.
            That sent the yield spread, or curve, between them to the lowest since 2009. That is likely a sign that
            people are taking this whole Fed tightening thing seriously, if not necessarily worried about inflation.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stocks are falling pretty sharply this morning as the month draws to an end, and there
            are new catalysts to blame: the Bank of Portugal's order that Banco Espirito Santo SA must raise capital;
            Argentina's default; a handful of lousy earnings reports from some big names. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ten-year
            Treasury yields surged 10 basis point yesterday and took an early jump today, then came back down to make a
            cool Sears Tower formation in the daily chart. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today's drop has left the SP 500 down
            about 0.6 percent for July, which would mark its first monthly decline since January. However, dips have
            been bought reliably, so check back at the end of the day to see where the chips fall for July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It does make you wonder if this is the beginning of the correction that will fulfill all the pundit
            prophecies? Who knows. One thing is sure: people will likely obsess over it in August, just like they did in
            July. Oh, and in June too... &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Investors and analysts of all shades and sizes are
            obsessed with the idea of a correction,' Birinyi Associates Inc. wrote in a note to clients at the end of
            June. 'We have always held that these efforts to foretell a correction are in vain.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway,
            come to think of it, there are some people who could brush their teeth with their mustache if they want:
            those with dentures. Hey, no one said coming up with market metaphors was any easier. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Yuan Trading in Korea Weakening Won Against Dollar</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A plan to start direct trading
            between the won and China's yuan will hurt the South Korean
            currency by slowing the inflow of dollars, Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Governments of the two Asian countries agreed on July 3 to
            make their currencies mutually exchangeable in Seoul later this
            year. The plan supports Goldman's prediction that the won will
            drop to 1,050 per dollar by the end of 2014, from 1,025.65
            today, Kwon Goohoon, a Seoul-based economist at the U.S. bank,
            wrote in today's report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This market will likely increase yuan settlement for
            Korean exports to China and expand yuan investments by Korean
            investors, weakening the won against the dollar in the
            process,' Kwon wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea's trade surplus with China, its biggest export
            partner, amounted to $24 billion in the first six months of this
            year, according to a July 1 government report. With only 0.3
            percent of trade payments settled in the Chinese currency, the
            won-yuan market has the potential to grow rapidly, the Goldman
            report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The value of South Korea's yuan transactions with China and
            Hong Kong has jumped by 5.6 times since June 2013, the Society
            for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or Swift,
            said in a July 29 statement. Bank of Korea data show yuan
            deposits in the country surged 80 percent this year as investors
            sought higher interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Payments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's currency ranked seventh for global payments in
            June, according to Swift. The won has appreciated 2.3 percent
            against the dollar this year and advanced 4.3 versus the yuan in
            the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The won, which can only trade onshore in South Korea at
            present, may also be transacted in China in the future. The two
            countries will seek to establish infrastructure enabling direct
            trading in Shanghai, according to a July 3 statement by the Bank
            of Korea and the finance ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement also awarded South Korea an 80 billion yuan
            ($13 billion) quota for domestic investors to buy securities in
            China under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional
            Investor program. Bank of Communications Co. was appointed as
            the yuan clearing bank in Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korea residents held $40.67 billion in dollar-denominated deposits at the end of June, while
            those in yuan
            were equivalent to $11.97 billion, central bank figures show.
            Goldman's Kwon estimates yuan savings in the country can rise
            2.5 times during the next 18 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Korean banks are testing won-yuan transactions. Woori
            Bank said it traded 1-month forward contracts directly with
            Barclays Plc on July 28, while Kookmin Bank said it settled a
            transaction with the Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
            on July 23. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ecuador Sends Gold Bricks to Goldman Sachs in Liquidity Hunt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador agreed to transfer more than
            half its gold reserves to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for three
            years to give the government easier access to cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank said it will send 466,000 ounces of gold
            to Goldman Sachs, worth about $580 million at current prices,
            and get the same amount back three years from now. In return,
            Ecuador will get 'instruments of high security and liquidity'
            and expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million over
            the term of the accord. The central bank didn't detail
            additional terms of the transactions, such as any fees or
            financing costs paid to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal comes as the South American country's government,
            which defaulted on about $3.2 billion of bonds five years ago,
            seeks to cover a budget deficit forecast by the Finance Ministry
            to swell to a record $4.94 billion this year. President Rafael Correa said in April he also planned to sell
            about $700 million
            of foreign debt this year in the country's first international
            bond sale since the 2008 and 2009 default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
            causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
            generate profits,' the central bank said in the statement.
            'These interventions in the gold market represent the beginning
            of a new and permanent strategy of active participation by the
            bank, through purchases, sales and financial operations, that
            will contribute to the creation of new financial investment
            opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reserves Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment. Central Bank President Diego
            Martinez didn't respond to requests made through the bank's
            press office seeking more information on the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country's gold reserves fell by $605 million, or 55
            percent, to $493 million in the week ending May 23, according
            to a separate report on the central bank's website. The bank,
            which was stripped of its autonomy in a 2008 constitutional
            referendum, had about 845,000 troy ounces of gold as of April
            14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
            provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
            that country's gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News
            showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, which wasn't completed, would have carried an
            interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
            interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
            to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
            margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
            dollars if it rose, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador's deal with Goldman Sachs is a signal the central
            bank is short on cash, Vicente Albornoz, the dean of the
            Universidad de las Americas business school in Quito, said in a
            telephone interview. The funds should help prop up government
            spending this year needed to drive economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'About the only thing that's clear is that they're
            converting part of their reserves into some sort of cash
            equivalent,' Albornoz said. 'If the government doesn't find
            funds to finance the deficit, it'll have to cut spending.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Scherr Strategy Head as Chisolm Retires</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) named
            Stephen Scherr as the firm's chief strategy officer to replace
            Andrew Chisholm, who's retiring after 29 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scherr, 50, will remain head of Latin America in addition
            to the new role, according to an internal memo today from Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary Cohn.
            David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed
            the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein's strategy since the financial crisis has been to
            remain in the firm's primary businesses even as some competitors
            more aggressively exit areas of trading. While Goldman Sachs has
            cut costs and assets, Blankfein has said he won't risk missing
            out on the opportunities of a rebound in trading activity for
            short-term gains in profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs earned an 11 percent return on equity last
            year, higher than peers while one-third of the returns it posted
            before the financial crisis. Cohn said last month that the
            current environment is 'abnormal' and features trading clients
            that are the least active in years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Scherr's role will include seeking opportunities for
            revenue growth even if broader market conditions don't improve
            in the near term, said a person with direct knowledge of the
            assignment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>ARC Hospitality to Buy $1.9 Billion of Hotels From Goldman Funds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;American Realty Capital Hospitality
            Trust Inc. agreed to pay $1.93 billion for a group of hotels
            that's indirectly owned by funds managed by Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc., creating one of the biggest hospitality-focused real
            estate investment trusts in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is buying 126 hotels in 35 states operated by
            brands including Holiday Inn, Hilton Garden Inn and Hyatt Place,
            the New York-based company said in a statement today. The
            properties, known as the Equity Inn portfolio, are the largest
            ever acquisition by ARC Hospitality. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three of the five largest U.S.-based global hotel operators
            have raised revenue forecasts for the year as the strengthening
            global economy has boosted demand for hotels. ARC Hospitality's
            purchase gives it access to hotels that offer limited food and
            beverage services to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The select-service hotel segment offers tremendous value
            given the economic recovery in the U.S., higher profit margins
            and reduced operational risks,' ARC Hospitality Chairman
            Nicholas Schorsch said in the statement. 'Now is an opportune
            time to acquire well-located, high-quality hotels in the upscale
            and upper midscale tiers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
            according to the statement. Realty Capital Securities LLC
            advised ARC Hospitality while Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank AG
            advised the sellers. The two banks will provide financing to ARC
            Hospitality in connection with the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>KKR Liquidates Hedge Fund Led by Ex-Goldman's Bob Howard</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co. (KKR) is shutting its equity
            hedge fund, about three years after hiring former Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. proprietary trader Bob Howard to run it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have decided to close KKR Equity Strategies and return
            capital to investors,' New York-based KKR said in an e-mailed
            statement. 'We would like to thank Bob Howard and the team for
            their dedication to the firm and exceptional professionalism in
            serving our clients.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $510 million KKR Equities Strategies fund, which was
            started in August 2011, was liquidated last week, according to a
            person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
            identified because the information is private. The fund had less
            than 20 outside clients who had $337 million invested, money
            that will be returned starting this month, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Howard is the latest former proprietary trader to leave an
            investment bank and join the $2.7 trillion hedge-fund industry,
            only to struggle with making money and attracting assets.
            Pierre-Henri Flamand, who ran Goldman Sachs's global
            proprietary-trading unit before setting out on his own, shut his
            hedge-fund firm in 2012 after two years because of losses and as
            assets dwindled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Howard's fund gained about 15 percent since inception, the
            person said. That compares with a 7.1 percent return from equity
            hedge funds in the same period, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Alumni &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dozen employees who made up the KKR Equity Strategies
            team were notified of the decision to shutter the fund on May
            30, the person said. Most of them worked with Howard at Goldman
            Sachs, where he ran the U.S. desk of its principal strategies
            group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Howard joined KKR in 2010 to start its first hedge fund.
            KKR gave Howard, a partner at the firm, $100 million to start
            the fund, according to marketing documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arvind Raghunathan, 50, the former head of Deutsche Bank
            AG's global arbitrage business who left with his team in 2009 to
            start Roc Capital Management LP, shuttered that hedge fund last
            year after losing money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Portman Square Capital LLP, founded by ex-Citigroup Inc.
            proprietary-trading unit head Sutesh Sharma, 51, last year
            opened with about $100 million, less than a fifth of the amount
            originally sought. CEO Andy Mack resigned this year and the firm
            is reducing operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flamand closed his Edoma Partners LLC in November 2012, a
            little more than two-and-a-half years after starting the hedge-fund firm. Man Group Plc said last month that
            Flamand will join
            the company as a senior money manager. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;KKR Prisma &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR said it will be focusing on KKR Prisma, a unit that has
            invested more than $10 billion in hedge funds, and the building
            of strategic stakes and backing of the firms. Last year KKR
            agreed to buy a 24.9 percent stake in Nephila Capital Ltd., a
            Bermuda-based firm that makes reinsurance-related investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR said it will also concentrate on its credit hedge funds
            that have about $800 million in assets. The firm last year
            bought Avoca Capital to expand its European credit business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buyout firms including Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle
            Group LP have built hedge fund investment units to diversify
            beyond private equity. Blackstone has grown its hedge fund
            investing unit, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, into
            the world's largest with $58 billion, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Gets Ecuador Gold as Correa Steps Up Cash Hunt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador, one of only eight countries
            to adopt the U.S. dollar as its official currency, swapped gold
            with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for liquid assets in a sign the
            nation is short on cash, according to Loomis Sayles Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It does raise a red flag,' Bianca Taylor, a sovereign
            analyst who helps oversee $210 billion at Loomis Sayles, said
            yesterday in a phone interview from Boston. 'Whenever a country
            needs to sell or monetize its gold reserves, it's definitely a
            signal that the sovereign is strapped for cash.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa is stepping up his search for
            financing at home and abroad after borrowing more than $11
            billion from China since defaulting on $3.2 billion of foreign
            debt five years ago. Ecuador's use of the dollar means it can't
            finance deficits by printing money like other countries. Correa,
            a self-described revolutionary socialist, is now planning to
            raise about $700 million in an overseas bond sale this year and
            agreed to allow the International Monetary Fund to perform an
            economic review for the first time since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador's central bank, stripped of its autonomy in a
            constitutional referendum a year after Correa took power in
            2007, says it 'invested' the gold with Goldman Sachs in return
            for assets that can be liquidated within seven days. The country
            will get the same quantity of gold back three years from now and
            expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million from the
            deal, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Productive Asset &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The operation didn't imply any payment of financing costs
            by the central bank to Goldman Sachs, the bank said today in an
            e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. The central
            bank said it also doesn't need the liquidity to finance
            spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
            causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
            generate profits,' the central bank said in the statement on
            its website disclosing the operation. 'These interventions in
            the gold market represent the beginning of a new and permanent
            strategy of active participation by the bank, through purchases,
            sales and financial operations, that will contribute to the
            creation of new financial investment opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry said yesterday the deal wasn't a sale
            and was a normal operation of investing reserves for profit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Puzzling Transaction' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction covers 466,000 ounces of gold, according to
            the central bank. That's 1,165 gold bars, worth about $580
            million at yesterday's prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A clue to the operation came last week, when the central
            bank reported a $605 million drop in its gold reserves to $493
            million during the week ending May 23. Net currency reserves
            rose by $434 million. At the time the central bank didn't
            explain the change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's not clear what Goldman Sachs plans to do with the
            bullion, said George Gero, a vice president and precious-metals
            strategist in New York at RBC Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's really a puzzling transaction,' Gero said yesterday
            in a telephone interview. 'The idea that there was a large sale
            and you don't know when it will come out into the market is
            probably pressuring prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Venezuela Proposal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spot gold prices had fallen for five straight days before
            today, when they rose 0.1 percent to 1,244.96 an ounce as of
            2:31 p.m. in New York. They're still down 34 percent from a peak
            of $1,900.20 an ounce in September 2011. Prices have gained 3.6
            percent so far this year and will fall to $1,240 by the end of
            the year, according to the median estimate of 34 analysts
            surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Money managers cut their net-long position, or bets on
            higher gold prices, by 24 percent in the week ended May 27,
            based on U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Short
            holdings, or bets on a gold-price decrease, surged 72 percent,
            the most in six months, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
            provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
            gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, which wasn't completed, would have carried an
            interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
            interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
            to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
            margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
            dollars if it rose, the documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador's transaction with Goldman Sachs 'has nothing to
            do' with the proposed Venezuelan deal, the central bank said in
            its e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Financing Options &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador will probably use the transaction proceeds to
            finance public spending, said Martin Castellano, a senior
            economist for Latin America at the Institute of International
            Finance, a trade association of banks and money managers
            including Goldman Sachs. Given the country's use of the
            greenback as its official currency, the government needs to
            ensure it has enough liquidity to avoid balance-of-payment
            problems, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The measure reflects the government's willingness to
            pursue whichever financing option is at hand in order to avoid a
            fiscal adjustment,' Castellano said yesterday in a telephone
            interview from Washington. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tourre had sought summary judgment, or a ruling before
            trial, in a lawsuit filed against him by the SEC. U.S. District
            Court Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan today denied his
            motion and granted the SEC a partial ruling that Tourre had
            violated a provision of the Securities and Exchange Act. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre, citing a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, claimed he
            couldn't be held liable under U.S. securities laws for foreign
            transactions, such as those he made for Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, which
            allegedly lost almost
            all of its $150 million investment, and ABN Amro Bank NV, which
            assumed the credit risk associated with a portion of a CDO
            called Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the Morrison v. National Australia Bank ruling by the
            Supreme Court, Tourre argued the SEC's claims should be
            dismissed because they involved transactions outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fraud Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forrest ruled that the SEC had established a domestic
            component of its fraud claim against Tourre tied to
            misrepresentations he made in connection with ACA Management
            LLC's sale of protection on $909 million of the Abacus notes,
            which defaulted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge granted the SEC its request for partial summary
            judgment on an Interstate Commerce claim that Tourre used the
            telephone, Internet or e-mail to accomplish his fraud, and a
            claim that the fraud occurred in connection with a transaction
            in which liability was incurred in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC sued the London-based trader in April 2010, saying
            he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge fund Paulson
            Co. had helped pick the underlying securities for Abacus and
            planned to bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'To make the showing, the SEC must prove only that the
            offeror was in the United States at the time he or she made the
            relevant offer,' Forrest said in her ruling. 'The SEC has
            satisfied that burden. It has cited to record evidence that
            would allow a reasonable jury to find that Tourre worked in New
            York at all relevant times. It has also cited to record evidence
            that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that he e-mailed
            and called both IKB and ABN to discuss possible transactions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Claim &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After reaching a $550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SEC filed a new
            claim against Tourre,
            saying he gave the company 'substantial assistance' as it
            misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2011, U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones, who presided
            over Tourre's case before leaving the bench, dismissed some
            claims involving IKB and ABN Amro, citing the Supreme Court
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The high court ruled that U.S. securities laws don't
            protect foreign investors who buy stocks on overseas exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pamela Rogers Chepiga, a lawyer representing Tourre, didn't
            immediately return a voice-mail message left at her office
            seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're pleased with the decision and look forward to
            proceeding to trial against Mr. Tourre,' John Nester, a
            spokesman for the SEC, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Hatzius Says Fed Could Taper Buying in September</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve could announce a
            reduction of its monthly bond purchases as early as September if
            employment and inflation strengthen enough, said Jan Hatzius,
            chief economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs's forecast remains for Fed officials to
            wait until December before slowing their $85 billion of monthly
            asset purchases, Hatzius said yesterday that so-called tapering
            could occur sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A September tapering is certainly possible, I think that
            is going to depend on the data,' Hatzius said in a Bloomberg
            Television interview at Goldman Sachs's Global Macro Conference
            in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Speculation that a strengthening U.S. economy will allow
            the Fed to reduce its monetary stimulus has helped propel the
            yield on the 10-year Treasury bond to its highest since April
            2012 even as Chairman Ben S. Bernanke expresses caution over
            trimming the program too soon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The likelihood that the economy will continue to grow about
            2 percent over the next couple of quarters with inflation 'well
            below' target will probably stay the Fed's hand until December,
            Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By contrast, an earlier pullback could occur if payrolls
            regularly increase by more than 200,000 a month or inflation
            outside of food and energy costs speeds up. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's definitely a mosaic of different indicators,'
            Hatzius said. 'It's the broad picture.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Consider Tapering &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernanke said May 22 during a response to questions
            following Congressional testimony that the central bank could
            consider reducing the amount of assets it buys within 'the next
            few meetings' if officials see signs of sustained improvement
            in the labor market. Still, he has warned that 'premature
            tightening' could reduce inflation and jeopardize the economic
            expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With unemployment lingering at 7.5 percent, higher than
            before the last recession, the policy-setting Federal Open
            Market Committee announced May 1 it will increase or decrease
            the pace of its monthly purchases in response to changes in
            inflation and the labor market. Policy makers agreed to maintain
            monthly buying of $40 billion in mortgage securities and $45
            billion of U.S. Treasuries in a bid to boost employment. The
            purchases have expanded Fed assets to about $3.4 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Very Resistant' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even with global bond markets posting their biggest monthly
            losses in nine years in May, led by a 2 percent drop in
            Treasuries, Hatzius said the Fed is going to be 'very resistant
            to a large tightening of financial conditions precipitated by a
            bond-market sell off.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He predicted the 10-year Treasury bond yield will end 2013
            at 2.5 percent and 2014 at 3 percent, up from 2.12 percent
            yesterday. Goldman Sachs anticipates U.S. economic growth of 1.9
            percent this year and 2.9 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not in his outlook is a repeat of 1994 when a sudden and
            sharp increase in interest rates from the Fed surprised many
            investors. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
            said May 2 that the current rate environment has parallels to
            then. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed increased its benchmark rate 3 percentage points
            from February 1994 to February 1995, from a then record-low 3
            percent to 6 percent. The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury
            bond surged above 8 percent in late 1994 from below 6 percent 12
            months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, employment and inflation are weaker than two decades
            ago, while the Fed has become more transparent and better at
            communicating its plans to financial markets, Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're not expecting a 1994,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Public Finance Executive Kathleen Brown to Retire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Kathleen Brown, who helped lead
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s municipal finance business after
            serving as California's state treasurer, is retiring after 12
            years with the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown, 67, was chairman of investment banking for the
            Midwest, according to a memo from Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, the firm's co-heads
            of investment
            banking. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based
            bank, confirmed the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Kathleen has played an integral role in building the
            firm's public sector and infrastructure franchise,' the memo
            reads. 'She has developed trusted relationships with many of
            the firm's clients and has led many important transactions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown ran the firm's West Coast municipal finance team
            until 2010, when she moved to a newly created post in Chicago
            and helped lead the public finance unit in the Midwest. The move
            came in part to avoid any conflict of interest after her brother
            Jerry Brown was elected California's governor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown's father, Edmund 'Pat' Brown Sr., also served as
            governor and Brown herself was the 1994 Democratic nominee,
            losing to Pete Wilson. She served as treasurer of the state from
            1991 to 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brown worked at Bank of America Corp. before joining
            Goldman Sachs in 2001 with its private wealth management group,
            according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dow Jones Newswires reported Brown's retirement earlier
            today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ecuador Used Gold Reserves for Goldman Sachs Loan Collateral</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador President Rafael Correa said
            proceeds from a loan obtained from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            after he offered more than half the country's gold reserves as
            collateral will go toward investing in economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government, faced with a budget deficit forecast to hit
            a record this year, said last week that it 'invested' 466,000
            ounces of gold with Goldman Sachs in return for 'instruments of
            high security and liquidity.' The transaction added to reserves
            of 'monetary gold' and would generate as much as $20 million
            in profit, according to a central bank statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gold reserves 'serve as collateral for a loan,'
            Correa told reporters today at the presidential palace in Quito.
            'With this loan, we can invest in the country.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal, amounting to 1,165 gold bars worth about $580
            million at current prices, comes on top of government attempts
            to sell about $700 million of bonds this year in what would be
            the nation's first foreign debt sale since it defaulted on $3.2
            billion of its notes in 2008 and 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ecuador's government hasn't sufficiently explained the
            operation with Goldman Sachs and the difference between the
            central bank's original statement and Correa's comments today,
            said Luis Fernando Torres, a congressional representative for
            Tungurahua province. The government has liquidity problems and
            has begun delaying payments to some public officials, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An investment and a loan are two totally different
            things,' Torres said today in an interview at the nation's
            Congress in Quito. 'This operation is baffling.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;$10 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Correa's administration is also in talks with China to
            finance a $10 billion refinery in the coastal province of Manta,
            Strategic Sectors Minister Rafael Poveda said today at the event
            in Quito. The government expects to sign a deal for $2 billion
            in August, of which $500 million will be for the government's
            discretionary use, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry forecasts the government will need
            about $4.94 billion to cover this year's budget deficit. The
            government has said that if it doesn't find the funds to finance
            the gap, it will cut spending on budgeted infrastructure
            projects. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Credit Suisse Rises on Goldman Upgrade</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Switzerland's
            No. 2 bank, rose the most in two weeks after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) raised its recommendation to buy from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts also raised their recommendation for
            Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) to neutral from sell, citing the decline in its
            stock and its plan to issue shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse rose as much as 2.1 percent in trading today
            after Goldman Sachs analysts including Jernej Omahen said its
            shares were among the most undervalued in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rise was the most since Credit Suisse settled a U.S.
            investigation of its role in helping Americans evade taxes. The
            settlement, announced after the close of trading on May 19,
            included a guilty plea and a fine of $2.6 billion. It resolved
            the last major litigation issue for Credit Suisse, Chief
            Executive Officer Brady Dougan said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank 'offers one of the highest upsides amongst
            our coverage,' the analysts wrote. 'We therefore upgrade the
            shares to buy and add it to our conviction list.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse shares were up 1.6 percent to 26.76 francs at
            12:20 p.m. in Zurich. At that price, it would have to rise 36
            percent to reach the analysts' 12-month price target of 36.50
            francs. Goldman Sachs said its view was based on the bank's
            current strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weak share performance, low expectations for profitability
            and low capital ratios are among factors that increase the
            chances of Credit Suisse adjusting its strategy, Goldman Sachs
            said. Its analysts see more potential for shares to rise if any
            such changes reduce the impact of investment banking on return
            on equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investment Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lowered its estimate of Credit Suisse's
            earnings per share for this year to 2.58 Swiss francs ($2.87)
            from 2.73 francs, citing a slowdown in debt trading. The mean
            estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is 2.11 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank is weighing on the company's return on
            equity, the analysts said, estimating the drag at about 5
            percent. Credit Suisse's return on equity, a measure of
            profitability, was 8 percent in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse says its common equity ratio at the end of
            the first quarter would have been 9.3 percent if the U.S.
            settlement were factored in. The bank lags 3.9 percentage points
            behind the biggest Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN) in this measure, Goldman
            Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In our view, an external capital hike remains an option
            for CS,' the Goldman Sachs analysts said. 'Additional source
            of capital generation would be welcome.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Barclays, BofA Fined Over Trading Data</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Barclays
            Plc and Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch unit were fined $1
            million each for submitting inaccurate information about
            securities trading to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks failed to provide 'complete and accurate
            information' about trading, known as blue sheet data, that
            regulators use to investigate potential insider trading and
            market manipulation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
            said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When firms fail to submit timely and accurate blue sheet
            data, it compromises the ability of every regulator to identify
            the perpetrators of illegal insider trading and other market
            abuses,' said Cameron Funkhouser, the head of Finra's fraud
            detection office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Finra said the violations included submissions that failed
            to include some customer names, contained incorrect names, and
            failed to include some transactions. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and
            Merrill Lynch each has a history of inaccurate blue sheet data,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs and Bill Halldin, a spokesman for Bank of America, based
            in Charlotte, North Carolina, declined comment. A spokesman for

        <headline>Goldman Said to Pledge $500 Million to Alibaba as IPO Looms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will lend
            $500 million to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as the company seeks
            $8 billion of loans, two people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The pledge by the New York-based bank forms part of a
            facility that will cut debt costs for China's biggest e-commerce
            company, the people said yesterday, asking not to be identified
            because the details are private. Edward Naylor, a spokesman for
            Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alibaba is locking in three- and five-year loan financing,
            introducing a smartphone operating system and buying a stake in
            China's biggest Twitter-like service -- steps considered a
            prelude to an initial public offering that may value the company
            at as much as $100 billion. Investment banks are keen to form
            relationships with Alibaba to increase their chances of being
            selected to help with the share sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs wants to use this as an opportunity for
            further chances of cooperation,' including the IPO, said Alex Wang, a Beijing-based analyst at Internet
            consulting group
            iResearch. 'These banks might not come across a chance like
            this in years.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Alibaba, said
            he had 'no comment on speculation regarding who may have joined
            the syndication' when asked about the company's financing
            plans. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Breaks Drought With Saudi Property Bond: Islamic Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose
            shariah-compliant bond program was questioned by Islamic
            scholars in 2011, led its first sukuk in more than three years
            after helping a Saudi property developer raise $450 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank was a lead arranger on Dar Al Arkan Real Estate
            Development Co. (ALARKAN)'s sukuk on May 21, reforging links with the
            Riyadh-based real estate company after helping arrange the sale
            of its $450 million five-year bonds in February 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is seeking to catch up with U.S.
            competitors as demand accelerates for securities that conform to
            Islamic principles. Global sales reached a record $46.5 billion
            last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while
            issuance has increased 4 percent to $18.3 billion in 2013.
            Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are U.S. banks that have
            appeared among the global top 10 underwriters for Islamic bonds
            in the last five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is an area of growing importance as a source of
            funding' for borrowers, Martin Weber, head of debt capital
            markets for Europe Middle East Africa growth markets at
            Goldman Sachs, said by phone yesterday. 'Our presence in the
            region and connectivity with local issuers has gone up. You have
            seen us on Dar Al Arkan, and there is going to be more.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Islamic financial assets could more than double by 2015 to
            as much as $3 trillion, Standard and Poor's said in September.
            Emerging market sukuk have returned 0.3 percent this year,
            according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai Sukuk Total Return Index.
            That compares with a loss of 1.9 percent for debt in Bloomberg
            USD Emerging Market Composite Bond Index. (BEM) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai Electricity Water Authority secured more than $5
            billion of bids for the $1 billion of Islamic bonds it sold in
            February. Islamic Development Bank, the Saudi Arabia-based
            multinational lender, last week received $1.5 billion in bids
            for $1 billion of securities as it paid the lowest yield of the
            year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Islamic industry is growing faster than conventional,
            so every financial institution is looking at it,' Afaq Khan,
            chief executive officer of Standard Chartered Saadiq, said by
            phone this week. 'If clients are demanding Shariah-compliant
            solutions, you must develop accordingly.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;GE Sukuk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman in 2009 helped arrange the sale of GE Capital's
            $500 million Islamic bond, ranking it 24th on the list of global
            sukuk underwriters. The bank was 17th in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'International sukuk issues, which is where houses such as
            ours would historically add value, had better times three years
            ago,' said Weber. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman has yet to issue from its own $2 billion sukuk
            program. The sukuk, blessed at the time by eight of the world's
            top scholars, was criticized by some Islamic advisers for not
            ensuring the debt would be traded at par value as mandated by
            Islamic law. Advisers including Riyadh-based Mohammed Khnifer of
            Edcomm Group Banker's Academy in New York also said it's unclear
            how Goldman will use the funds it raises. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lack of product and industry knowledge could up-end the
            essence of Shariah-compliance,' Hatim El-Tahir, director of
            Deloitte's Islamic Finance Knowledge Centre, said by e-mail this
            week. 'It could threaten the risk-return profile of both
            industry and product.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growth Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks 'need to see a buoyant product, and right now that
            is sukuk,' Rizwan Kanji, Dubai-based partner at King
            Spalding, said by phone this week. 'That is what is driving
            these players.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has hired a 'big name' in Hussein Hassan, former
            global head of Islamic structuring at UBS AG (UBSN), which proves the
            bank's commitment to the industry, Kanji said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BofA Merrill Lynch was a lead manager as Asya Katilim
            Bankasi AS (ASYAB) raised $250 million in Tier 2, 10-year bonds on March
            28. The issue was the first of its kind from Europe, Turkey or
            the Middle East, King Spalding said. Kanji worked on the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BofA Merrill Lynch has done a lot of conventional
            issuance in Turkey,' said Kanji. 'The bank has played to its
            strengths to build an Islamic platform.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for JPMorgan and BofA Merrill Lynch weren't
            available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Increased competition in the industry could work in banks'
            favor, said Standard Chartered (STAN)'s Khan, as lower fees increase
            the chances borrowers will come to market and more banks means a
            greater profile for the Islamic industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forty-three banks have underwritten global sukuk sales this
            year, compared with 30 in the year-earlier period, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Forty-four companies and governments
            have sold Islamic bonds, up from 36 in the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The more people we have talking about a product and
            Islamic solutions to their clients, the deeper the market
            becomes,' said Khan. 'So while a few fees may go down, the
            absolute size of the market will increase.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Bull Run Over as Returns Trail Stocks: Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities are trailing equities for
            the longest stretch in almost 15 years as Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. and Citigroup Inc. predict the end of the decade-long bull
            market even as the global economy expands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
            lagged behind the MSCI All-Country World Index for six months,
            the longest stretch since 1998. Hedge funds cut combined bullish
            bets across 18 U.S. raw-material futures by 51 percent from a
            16-month high in September and are bearish on six of them.
            Commodities will return 1.6 percent in a year as losses in
            agriculture and precious metals diminish gains from energy and
            industrial metals, Goldman said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors pulled a record $23.3 billion from commodity
            funds this year as global equities attracted $182 billion,
            according to EPFR Global, which tracks money flows. Prices that
            more than doubled in 10 years spurred expansions at mines, farms
            and oil fields. Gluts are emerging as the International Monetary
            Fund predicts global growth of 3.3 percent this year, from 3.2
            percent in 2012. The group cut last week its estimates for
            China, the top consumer of metals, grains and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are times when you probably should be avoiding
            commodities, and I think this is one of them,' said John Stephenson, who helps oversee about C$2.7 billion
            ($2.61
            billion) at First Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto.
            'Anytime you have a whole lot of inventory and visible supply,
            prices are going to be under pressure. The real issue for
            commodities is the source of demand, China, is weak.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Natural Gas &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI dropped 2.8 percent this year, as 17 members
            of the gauge retreated. Silver led the decline, falling 25
            percent. Corn and gold also entered bear markets in April,
            joining copper, sugar, wheat, soybeans and coffee. Natural gas
            is leading the gainers with a 14 percent advance, while cotton
            rose 13 percent. The commodity index is 29 percent below its
            record close in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI equity gauge gained 6.7 percent since the end of
            December, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the SP 500
            Index reaching records last month. The dollar strengthened 2.2
            percent against six major trading partners. Global bonds
            measured by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Broad
            Market Index lost 1.5 percent in May, the most since April 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities are diverging from equities as the supercycle,
            or longer-than-average period of rising prices, is eclipsed by
            the supply surge, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman's head of commodities
            research in New York, wrote in a report May 14. The agricultural
            segment of the SP GSCI will drop 13 percent in 12 months as
            livestock and precious metals lose 4 percent, he said. Energy
            and industrial metals will advance 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Domestic Consumption &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most commodities will drop this year as China's economy
            moves from a focus on infrastructure to domestic consumption and
            services, Citigroup's Ed Morse said in a May 20 report. That
            means investors should pay more attention to supply and demand
            rather than just broad economic trends, he said. The bank
            predicted the end of the supercycle in November. UBS AG and
            Credit Suisse Group AG made similar forecasts this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI more than tripled since the end of 1999,
            including 11 gains over the past 13 years, setting records in
            everything from oil to gold to copper. Producers struggled to
            keep up as China's economy expanded more than fivefold. That
            attracted a surge of investment and assets under management
            totaled $409 billion in March, from $154 billion at the end of
            2008, Barclays Plc estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Corn Supply &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pessimism about commodities is focusing on the price of raw
            materials as the pace of growth in consumption slows. China will
            use 5.2 percent more copper this year, from a gain of 6.8
            percent in 2012, Barclays estimates. The nation is still using
            enough copper in cables each month to circle the globe almost 90
            times, government data show. It will consume more than one in
            every five tons of global corn supply this year as its hog herd
            reaches 447 million animals, six times the U.S. figure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., where builders use about 400 pounds of copper
            in a single-family home, sales of new properties in April
            reached the second-fastest pace since July 2008. Central banks
            in the U.S., Europe and Asia are still printing unprecedented
            amounts of money to boost growth, adding to the almost doubling
            of global sovereign debt to $23 trillion since the end of 2008,
            a Bank of America index shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Exporter &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Supply expansions may fall short of forecasts as bad
            weather curbs crops in the U.S., the biggest exporter, and
            mining is disrupted. Farmers in Iowa, the largest U.S. corn and
            soybean grower, had their wettest April and May in records going
            back to 1873. Freeport-McMoRan Copper Gold Inc.'s Grasberg
            operation may be shut for as long as three months after a tunnel
            collapsed last month. The Indonesian mine is the biggest source
            of copper after Escondida in Chile, where port strikes have
            disrupted metal shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The outlook for commodities is likely to be brighter,'
            said Alan Gayle, a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital
            Management in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $48
            billion of assets. 'The outlook will turn bullish when demand
            starts moving higher. I'm not jumping in yet with both feet and
            am going to let the story develop first, which I expect to
            happen over the next few months.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for
            Chinese growth this year and next on May 29. It's now predicting
            7.75 percent, from an earlier projection of 8 percent for 2013
            and 8.2 percent for 2014. The U.S. economy grew at a 2.4 percent
            annualized rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department
            said May 30, cutting its previous estimate of 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Largest Retailer &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cheaper raw materials may boost margins for companies from
            McDonald's Corp. to General Mills Inc. to Boeing Co., while
            keeping inflation in check and allowing the Federal Reserve to
            continue stimulus. Kraft Foods Group Inc. cut the cost of its
            Gevalia coffee by 6 percent last month and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
            the world's largest retailer, is reducing grocery prices. U.S.
            retail gasoline fell 4.5 percent from this year's peak in
            February, American Automobile Association data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds and other large speculators are holding a net-long position of 652,708 futures and
            options across 18 U.S.
            commodities, from 1.3 million in September, government data
            show. Supply will exceed demand for 12 of 18 of the metals and
            agricultural products, according to estimates from Barclays and
            Rabobank International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude oil will average $90 a barrel
            this year, from $94.15 in 2012, Citigroup estimates. U.S.
            inventories reached the highest since 1931 on May 24, government
            data show. New drilling technology is unlocking supplies trapped
            in shale formations, helping the U.S. meet the highest
            proportion of its own energy needs since 1986. Crude rose 2.7
            percent in New York trading this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Exchange Traded &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold dropped 17 percent, the worst start to a year since
            1982. Holdings through exchange-traded products tumbled 19
            percent to the lowest since May 2011. Bullion will drop this
            year for the first time since 2000, according to a Bloomberg
            survey of 38 analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The LMEX index of six industrial metals fell 6.3 percent.
            Copper stockpiles tracked by exchanges in London, Shanghai and
            New York more than doubled in the past year. Production will
            outpace demand for the first time in four years in 2013, Morgan
            Stanley predicts. Prices will decline about 6 percent in 12
            months, Goldman estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Farmers around the world will harvest the biggest grain and
            soybean crops ever, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
            estimates. Corn will extend this year's 22 percent decline by
            another 3.2 percent in six months, as wheat drops 11 percent,
            Goldman says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have the combination of higher production together
            with slower growth in China,' said Adrian Day, who manages
            about $135 million of assets as the president of Adrian Day
            Asset Management in Annapolis, Maryland. 'For rest of the year,
            you have a potential surplus of production over demand, which
            obviously means lower prices.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UBS Defies Goldman Call for Brazil Rally on World Cup Win</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            both say that Brazil will probably win its sixth World Cup title
            next month. They have opposing calls on the market's reaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman cites historical data for past winners to
            predict a victory for the national team will spark a rally for
            Brazilian stocks, UBS said in a report today that local politics
            mean a defeat could spur gains by further eroding the popularity
            of President Dilma Rousseff's government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks posted the biggest rally among the world's
            major stock indexes today after a poll showed declining support
            for Rousseff ahead of October elections in which she'll seek a
            second four-year term. Investors are betting that a new
            president will interfere less in state-controlled companies such
            as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, bolstering their prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the national team 'crashes and burns' in the Cup, or
            if the tournament suffers a major organizational catastrophe,
            widespread social discontent could ensue,' Jorge Mariscal, the
            chief investment officer for emerging markets at UBS Wealth
            Management, wrote. 'However, short-term economic pain and anti-Dilma sentiment could be good for financial
            markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The elections, expectations for a Brazil victory as well as
            an 'unstable' social situation evident in street protests over
            $11 billion in spending tied to the games, make this year's
            tournament especially important for markets, UBS said. In
            addition to how well the team fares, Rousseff's popularity could
            also be hurt by traffic jams and other problems that expose
            Brazil's lack of preparation, Mariscal said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Investors should get ready to carefully follow
            developments not only inside the soccer stadium, but also on the
            streets of Brazil's largest cities,' UBS said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Call &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs recommended buying Brazilian assets in a May
            28 report, saying history shows a win will boost the country's
            stock markets in the weeks after the final. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The victor country's equity markets outperform global
            stocks by 3.5 percentage points in dollar terms on average in
            the first month after winning, 'although the outperformance
            fades significantly after three months,' according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS, which looked at the winning nations' stock markets in
            local currency terms since the 1974 World Cup, said the winner
            underperformed global equities in the week after the final in
            six of eight times, with a median underperformance of 0.7
            percent. Considering one-month returns after the World Cup, the
            median nation outperformed by 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the analysts are split on the effect of a win on the
            country's assets, they agree that Brazil is likely to get a
            record sixth title at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium next
            month. UBS called the team as the 'clear favorite,' joining
            Goldman, Danske Bank A/S and Unicredit SpA, who all predicted
            the host team will beat Argentina in the final match. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Support Slips &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rousseff's support fell to 34 percent this month from 37
            percent in May, according to a Datafolha poll published today on
            Folha de Sao Paulo's website. All of Rousseff's challengers
            together garnered 35 percent, a gap from the front-runner that
            is within the two-percentage-point margin of error in the June
            3-5 survey. To win in the first round a candidate needs to have
            more than 50 percent support, or more votes than all other
            candidates combined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ibovespa jumped 3 percent today in Sao Paulo as state-run companies surged after the poll
            results. Petrobras, as the
            state-controlled oil producer is known, added 8.3 percent to
            17.68 reais, the biggest one-day advance since March 2013. &lt;/p&gt;

            perennial leader in advising on mergers and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The single Brazilian bank

            &lt;p&gt;Setubal launched his quest by acquiring a small rival, Banco BBA Creditanstalt SA, in 2003. He
            renamed it Banco Itau BBA SA and told its CEO, Fernao Bracher, that his job was to dislodge foreign banks
            from their perches atop the investment-banking ranks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Setubal opened the coffers of

            BBA as a different company, we kept the sophistication, agility and flexibility in decision making of an

        <headline>IDFC Joins Goldman in Increasing India Wind Investments</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; June 7 (Bloomberg) -' IDFC Ltd. (IDFC), India's biggest financier
            of clean-energy projects, will increase its investment in wind
            power, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in adding to holdings in
            the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IDFC's alternative assets arm will invest about 2.5 billion
            rupees ($44 million) over the next six months in its Green Infra
            Ltd. unit, Raja Parthasarathy, partner at IDFC Alternatives,
            said in an interview. That will boost its investment in Green
            Infra to 12 billion rupees to help the unit fund acquisitions
            before a planned initial public offering, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will raise its investment in India's ReNew
            Wind Power Pvt. by $135 million to $385 million, spokesman
            Edward Naylor said in an e-mail yesterday. Wind power producers
            in India are buying smaller companies and consolidating in an
            effort to amass larger portfolios that generate cheaper power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are excellent opportunities in the market for
            companies with the capital,' Parthasarathy said in the May 31
            interview by phone. The additional funding will allow Green
            Infra to expand faster by buying already operating wind and
            possibly solar assets, he said. 'You will see us a lot more
            active on acquisitions of operating assets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire a majority stake in ReNew
            Wind for 10 billion rupees in September 2011. The wind producer
            plans to have 1,000 megawatts of generation capacity by 2015,
            the companies said in a statement at that time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Planned IPO &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New Delhi-based Green Infra, a renewable-energy developer
            set up by IDFC in 2008, will consider an IPO once it has
            increased capacity, Parthasarathy said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'To get to the public market, Green Infra needs to be of a
            size and scale that will allow for a successful listing,' he
            said. That should be in about 18 months as the company raises
            operating capacity to 500 megawatts, from 320 megawatts
            currently, the executive said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Selling shares in Singapore, London's Alternative
            Investment Market or locally are among the possibilities Green
            Infra will evaluate, Parthasarathy said. Hyderabad-based Mytrah
            Energy Ltd. (MYT), backed by IDFC's infrastructure arm, and the wind
            unit of Mumbai-based lender Infrastructure Leasing Financial
            Services Ltd. are also evaluating share sales in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IDFC has invested 39 billion rupees in clean-energy
            companies, more than the state-backed Indian Renewable Energy
            Development Agency, making it the industry's biggest funder,
            according to IDFC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those include investments in Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI)'s solar
            photovoltaic unit and wind-turbine maker Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)'s SE
            Forge unit. IDFC swapped its SE Forge shares into those of the
            listed parent two years ago, then sold off its Suzlon stake
            recently, Parthasarathy said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blackstone's Blitzer Hunts Goldman's Lost Opportunities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;David Blitzer had his eye on Addy Loudiadis's business at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By the middle of 2013, the Blackstone Group LP (BX) dealmaker had his shot. Pressured by regulators
            to boost capital under new rules, the bank started looking for investors to take pieces of Rothesay Life
            Ltd., the insurer that Loudiadis heads in London. Blitzer, whose private-equity firm historically has to
            control companies it buys, was fine taking a minority stake in a Goldman cash cow. In October, he struck a
            $297 million deal to buy 28.5 percent of Rothesay, with Singapore's sovereign fund taking an equal share.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blitzer has spent the past two years engineering unorthodox deals like Rothesay that no
            one else within Blackstone could do. The 44-year old New Jersey native runs Tactical Opportunities Group, a
            $5.6 billion unit with the mandate to make investments that fall between the cracks of the firm's other
            businesses. The group has bought oil tankers, developed Brazilian shopping malls, and created a finance unit
            for U.S. landlords, capitalizing as banks are forced to shrink, and cutting deals that were the domain of
            Wall Street before its retreat from proprietary investing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'An awful lot of what Tac Ops
            does was either done by the big banks on their proprietary trading desks or by hedge funds in their illiquid
            side pockets,' Tony James, Blackstone's president, said in an interview last month. 'Both those sorts of
            capital have been eliminated and unless they come back, there will be tons of opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells Biggest Topix-Tied Note Since December 2010</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $85
            million of notes tied to the Topix index of Japanese stocks, the
            largest such offering since December 2010, after increasing the
            size twice. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The six-month securities, $15 million of which were most
            recently issued on June 4, yield the gains and losses of the
            benchmark with all capital at risk, according to a prospectus
            filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The New
            York-based bank sold the first $50 million offering on March 21
            and $20 million more on May 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's stocks have gained the most among developed markets
            this year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to beat
            deflation and the Bank of Japan embarked on unprecedented
            stimulus measures. The central bank plans to buy more than 7
            trillion yen ($71 billion) of bonds a month to increase
            inflation to 2 percent within two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As Japan continues to pursue these policies, it is
            helping to bolster domestic and foreign interest in their stock
            market,' said Michael Woolfolk, global markets strategist in
            New York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Topix, as the Tokyo Price Index is known, climbed 29
            percent to 1,111.97 this year as of the close of trading on June
            10. The Standard Poor's 500 Index, the most common equity
            benchmark tied to U.S. structured notes, rose 15 percent to
            1,642.81 during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank estimated the value of the original offering as
            98.9 cents on the dollar, a prospectus filed with the SEC shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bigger Offerings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There have been two larger offerings tied to the Topix
            index since 2010, when Bloomberg started collecting
            comprehensive data on structured notes. The biggest, $174.2
            million of 16-month notes, was issued by the Scandinavian lender
            Eksportfinans ASA on Dec. 8, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
            York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China Commodity Financing Seen Declining by Goldman Sachs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign banks are projected by
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lend less money against commodity
            inventories in China amid a probe into metals stockpiles in the
            biggest consumer of raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Claims that single batches of copper and aluminum at
            Qingdao Port were pledged as collateral for multiple loans risks
            undermining a broader practice in which traders use everything
            from iron ore to rubber to get funding. The investigation is
            already weighing down copper prices and may curb foreign
            exchange inflows to China, according to a report by Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The probe may affect metals stockpiles at the northeastern
            port held by Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., the trader
            controlled by China's largest state-owned company said today.
            Standard Chartered Plc said last week it was reviewing financing
            to some companies in China and Standard Bank Group started
            looking at 'potential irregularities' with metals at Qingdao.
            Citigroup Inc. said it would work closely with authorities and
            warehousing companies to resolve any problems for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The developments in Qingdao are likely to continue the
            significant scaling back of FX inflows from foreign banks into
            China via commodity financing business,' analysts at New York-based Goldman said in the report dated
            yesterday. 'As foreign
            banks reduce their exposure to Chinese commodity financing
            deals, the profitability of these could be reduced
            meaningfully.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Price Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copper in London may fall to $6,200 a metric ton before the
            end of this year, analysts including Roger Yuan and Max Layton
            said in a report. Benchmark three-month futures on the London
            Metal Exchange slumped 9.7 percent this year and traded at
            $6,645 at 5:45 p.m. Shanghai time, putting them on course for
            the lowest closing price since May 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency flows may be affected because Chinese borrowers
            often use commodities as collateral to get low interest loans
            from overseas lenders in dollars. They then bring the money
            onshore to invest in the nation's higher interest rate
            environment before later repaying the sum. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qingdao Port said in a June 6 statement that public
            security authorities were probing alleged fraud involving
            material held in its Dagang bonded storage area. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Public security authorities in Qingdao have not responded
            to calls by Bloomberg News seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The authenticity of warehouse receipts is critical to the
            practice of inventory financing in bonded warehouses,' Barclays
            Plc analyst Sijin Cheng wrote in a report last week. 'Feedback
            from trading house contacts suggests that this investigation has
            cast a pall on the financing trade as a whole.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Port Shares &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares (6198) of Qingdao Port International Co., which listed on
            the stock exchange in Hong Kong on June 5, have fallen 3.5
            percent from their offer price to $HK3.63 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigation is into the owner of some metals and a
            third party storing them in the Dagang area and not Qingdao Port
            itself, according to the June 6 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The company continues to provide regular port services to
            other clients and for all metal ore products, including aluminum
            and copper products,' it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, some Chinese banks have raised margins for
            letters of credit for iron ore financing to as much as 50
            percent from as much as 30 percent previously, said two people
            with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Others reduced overall credit available for iron ore
            financing and set a cap on credit used in some locations
            including Rizhao, a port located about 100 kilometers (65 miles)
            southeast of Qingdao, according to the people, who asked not to
            be identified because they aren't authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Locked Gates &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dagang area has been sealed and gates to the area are
            chained and padlocked, Reuters reported. The amount of metal
            involved in the probe was about 20,000 tons of copper, almost
            100,000 tons of aluminum ingots and about 200,000 tons of
            alumina, Reuters said, citing a source it didn't name. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jiangxi Copper Co., China's biggest smelter of the metal,
            said the problems at Qingdao don't represent a systemic risk and
            won't hurt demand or production of industrial metals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As well as industrial metals, Qingdao port also handles
            iron ore and agricultural commodities including cotton and
            rubber. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shanghai is China's biggest port and storage center for
            industrial metals. Copper inventories in bonded zones in
            Shanghai were estimated to be about 815,000 tons in April by
            CRU, a London-based consultant. Citrine Capital Management LLC
            said in June that stockpiles in bonded warehouses across China
            may be about 900,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The probe will make China's banks 'extremely cautious'
            about financing deals, though lenders will continue to help fund
            shipments to end-users, Colin Hamilton, Macquarie Group Ltd.'s
            head of commodities research, said June 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some copper may be moved from China to LME warehouses in
            South Korea, and possibly Singapore and Malaysia, Jeremy Goldwyn, head of business development in Asia for
            Sucden
            Financial Ltd., said June 5. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Shuns 'New Neutral' After Doubting 'New Normal'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. didn't buy the 'new normal' and it's not rushing to embrace the 'new
            neutral' either. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson are
            questioning the bet made last month by investor Bill Gross that Federal Reserve monetary tightening will be
            much less aggressive than in the past -- when it comes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We do not disagree that the Fed
            funds rate will on average be at least modestly lower over the next 20 years than it was over the 20 years
            preceding the crisis,' New York-based economist Kris Dawsey wrote in a June 6 report. 'We lean towards the
            view that the difference will not be drastic.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            Gross Says 'New Neutral' Rate Lower for Years to Come
            Goldman Shuns Bonds Pimco's Gross Favors in 'New Neutral'
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is not alone in questioning the 'new neutral,' the level at which the Fed benchmark
            neither stimulates nor slows the economy. The term was coined by Bloomberg News in a March 17 report and
            then promoted by Gross's Pacific Investment Management Co. It describes the view that the Fed is unlikely to
            raise the rate much beyond 2 percent because potential growth is weaker and debt higher than before the
            recession. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using bond yields and surveys of forecasters, Dawsey reckons investors
            anticipate a neutral rate of 3.8 percent, in line with the 4 percent projected by Fed officials. While
            Goldman Sachs still doesn't expect the Fed to begin raising before 2016, it predicts the key rate will reach
            4 percent at the end of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            In 2012, Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius sided with the view that monetary stimulus could help
            reduce unemployment, while Bill Gross argued joblessness was permanently elevated and would only by eased
            'at the margin' by easy monetary policy. Close

        <headline>Goldman Loan to Ex-Trader Cader Is Backed by 15,000 Wines</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Talk about liquid assets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) accepted almost 15,000
            bottles of fine wine as loan collateral from a former high-ranking executive, according to a regulatory
            filing last month. Andrew Cader, a former senior director at Goldman Sachs's specialist-trading unit,
            pledged a secured interest in the wines, which are primarily from the Burgundy and Bordeaux regions of
            France, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's move stands out because private banks that
            lend money to wealthy clients against assets such as artwork and real estate have been less willing to
            extend loans backed by fine wines, said four specialty lenders and attorneys. While investment-grade wines
            have outperformed the stock market over the past decade, the asset class has been prone to fraud, prompting
            billionaire William Koch to file a series of lawsuits to deter counterfeiting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There
            are a lot of very highly valued wines here,' said David Parker, the head of Benchmark Wine Group in Napa,
            California, adding that the collection cited in the filing had an estimated market value in the
            low-seven-digit dollar range. 'The Bordeaux are all first growth and other classified-growth and the
            Burgundies are all grand cru and top premier cru.' &lt;/p&gt;

            Andrew Cader was sued in April by hedge-fund manager Warren Lichtenstein, pictured, the chairman of New
            York-based Steel Partners LLC, who claimed Cader helped wrongly inflate child support payments for the
            mother of Lichtenstein's 5-year-old daughter. Close

            hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as a financial adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was hired after a board meeting to be the

            was interested in taking a stake in the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank Asya was founded by followers of Fethullah Gulen, the
            U.S.-based Islamic cleric blamed by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the corruption probe that
            implicated members of his

        <headline>Goldman Says Keeping U.S. Oil-Export Ban Helps Economy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A four-decade-old U.S. ban on crude
            exports should remain until a 'saturation' point when domestic
            refining capacity can't absorb increased oil production,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Maintaining the statutory curb on shipments overseas will
            deliver the 'highest value' to the U.S. economy, the bank said
            in an e-mailed report today. At current extraction costs, the
            export ban may start to weigh on U.S. output growth in coming
            years, it predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Goldman view is very credible,' said Sarah Emerson,
            managing principal of ESAI Energy Inc. in Wakefield,
            Massachusetts. 'Refiners are processing increasing output here
            and that's a greater benefit to the economy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rising production from shale formations has allowed the
            U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, to import less crude,
            fueling speculation that the curb on exports could be lifted. A
            1975 federal law bans most shipments overseas, with only
            deliveries of refined products including gasoline and diesel
            allowed. Supporters of the ban say keeping U.S.-produced oil at
            home helps reduce fuel prices for industry and consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Optimal Decision' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Keeping the ban in place would be the optimal decision
            until saturation is reached to maximize the contribution of the
            refining sector,' said Damien Courvalin, a Goldman analyst in
            New York. 'Once saturation is reached, it would then be optimal
            to lift the ban as value added from higher production
            outperforms value added from the refining sectors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Uncertainty over the future of the ban is probably delaying
            investment in U.S. refining capacity, according to Goldman. Oil
            companies are seeking ways around it by using simple, one-step
            plants capable of turning crude into products for exports. BP
            Plc signed on to take at least 80 percent of the capacity of a
            new $360 million mini-refinery in Houston that will process just
            enough to escape the restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IHS Inc. last month said the ban should be lifted because
            the U.S. will benefit from higher oil production and reduced
            gasoline prices. The nation may save an average of $67 billion a
            year from its import bill in 2016 and add 964,000 jobs by 2018,
            according to the Colorado-based consultant. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Premature' Urgency &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The urgency of the debate has been premature,' Emerson
            said. 'We aren't at the saturation point and won't be for a
            long time because there are a bunch of ways refiners are able to
            transform these molecules and make products for export.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. crude production rose 77,000 barrels a day to 8.46
            million last week, the Energy Information Administration said
            today. Output reached 8.47 million barrels a day in the week
            ended May 23, the most since October 1986, according to the EIA,
            the Energy Department's statistical arm. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Patti B. Saris in Boston, citing a jury
            verdict in January that rejected a $580 million negligence suit
            filed by Dragon founders Jim and Janet Baker and two other
            shareholders, denied the plaintiffs' request for claims against
            Goldman Sachs under the state's Unfair Trade Practices statute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge called the investment banking team assigned to
            the all-stock sale of Dragon to a Belgium competitor in 2000
            'professionally negligent' because it didn't fully vet buyer
            Lernout Hauspie Speech Products NV, which collapsed in an
            accounting fraud rendering the deal worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The reasons why small startup companies like Dragon go to
            a place like Goldman to assist with hatching their golden eggs
            is because they don't have their own expertise to analyze
            revenue projects by asking tough questions to potential merger
            partners,' the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Still, I give weight to the fact that the jury found for
            the defendant on this claim and there was sufficient evidence to
            support that finding even if I conclude otherwise,' Saris said
            in yesterday's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bakers' attorney, Alan Cotler of Reed Smith LLP, said
            yesterday in an e-mail that his firm was still studying the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said yesterday in a statement it was pleased
            the judge respected the jury's unanimous verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Jury's Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The evidence showed, and the jury concluded, that the
            banking team satisfactorily performed its role for Dragon
            Systems in all respects,' the New York-based bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bakers, who started Dragon in 1982 in their Newton,
            Massachusetts, home, along with shareholders Robert Roth and
            Paul Bamberg, lost about $300 million along with the
            intellectual property, the judge found. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Plaintiffs may have been brilliant mathematicians and
            scientists, but they had no financial experience with mergers
            and acquisitions,' Saris said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman team was lead by Richard Wayner, then 31, and
            included two bankers in their 20s, and a technology strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge found Wayner should have spoken up at a key
            Dragon board meeting and told members that Goldman Sachs wanted
            further review of LH's revenue figures in Asia, which were
            later revealed as a fraud. Instead, Wayner deferred to Janet
            Baker, who was eager to complete the sale and made positive
            comments about the pending deal, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Due Diligence &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At the very least, in my view, the Goldman team should
            have disclosed their continuing due diligence concerns,' Saris
            said. 'However, there is no evidence that their failure to do
            so was egregious.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs argued Goldman Sachs should have told Dragon
            that the bank's own Principal Investment Area considered an
            investment in LH in the late 1990s and decided against risking
            the bank's money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge found none of the bankers on the Dragon deal knew
            about the work known as 'Project Sermon,' and no one at
            Goldman withheld information about why the bank never invested. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LH created bogus customers, booked circular transactions
            with shell companies and recorded loans as sales from 1996 to
            2000, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            probe. Four executives were sentenced to prison for fraud in a
            criminal investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Baker v. Goldman Sachs Co., 09-cv-10053, U.S.
            District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partners
            Daniel Shefter, who ran the corporate finance solutions group,
            and Orit Freedman Weissman, the firm's head of Israel, have left

            &lt;p&gt;Shefter and Freedman Weissman were absent from a list of
            partners released today. Shefter is now an advisory director and
            Freedman Weissman agreed to become an international country
            adviser for New York-based Goldman Sachs, according to internal
            memos earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shefter joined the company in 1996 after working as a tax
            lawyer and became a partner in 2010. Freedman Weissman started
            at the firm in 1993 and established the bank's business in
            Israel a few years later. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Eyes Japan Offshore Wind in Clean Energy Expansion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the New
            York-based bank planning as much as 300 billion yen ($3.19
            billion) in renewable energy investments in Japan, is eyeing
            offshore wind power after building up holdings in more
            established clean energy sources such as solar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy Co. was set up by Goldman in August
            after Japan began offering above-market rates to producers of
            clean energy. The incentives, or feed-in tariffs, have spurred
            investments in renewables, setting Japan on course this year to
            become one of the world's largest solar markets by annual
            installations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company sees offshore wind as promising, Shigeru Yasu,
            a representative director at Japan Renewable Energy, said in an
            interview in Tokyo yesterday. Geothermal and biomass power also
            hold potential, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It takes three to four years to do an environmental
            impact study for an onshore wind project with more than 10
            megawatts of capacity,' Yasu said. 'Projects with larger
            capacity are more attractive because an environmental study
            requires the same amount of time even for a 500-megawatt
            offshore farm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Five-Year Investment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy plans in the next five years to
            invest as much as 50 billion yen directly into clean energy
            projects with capital provided by GS Infrastructure Partners. It
            will take as much as 250 billion yen of loans for project
            financing, Takahisa Nakagawa, also a representative director at
            Japan Renewable Energy, said in the interview. The investments
            and loans will amount to about 1,000 megawatts of clean energy,
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wind power is more challenging than solar for a developer
            because it requires prior investment such as an environmental
            impact study, Nakagawa said, adding that his company has the
            advantage of having people with expertise in wind power. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan's offshore wind market -- 31 megawatts in cumulative
            capacity -- lags behind countries like the U.K. and Denmark with
            3,093 megawatts and 923 megawatts of capacity, respectively,
            according to 2012 data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Offshore wind typically requires approval from local
            fishermen before projects can move ahead and costs more for
            installation and maintenance than onshore wind. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan Renewable Energy is considering more than 300
            megawatts worth of solar projects, Nakagawa said. The company
            will use panels by LS Industrial Systems Co. (010120), a South Korean
            electric and industrial equipment maker, at least for its first
            four plants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Panel Supplier &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LSIS was picked because it offers quality products for less
            compared with Japanese makers and because panels aren't the only
            product the company produces, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are big pureplay solar panel companies that went
            bankrupt and that's worrisome,' Yasu said. 'Even though a
            company offers 20 years of warranty, it's no good if the company
            won't be around 20 years later.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan is set to overtake Germany as the world's largest
            solar market, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developers may install 6.9 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts of
            solar in Japan in 2013, the London-based research agency said.
            Germany led solar installations in 2012 with 7.6 gigawatts of
            capacity. Cumulative global solar energy installations reached
            102 gigawatts for the first time in 2012, according to
            preliminary BNEF data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB) is
            buying the riskiest slice of a commercial-mortgage bond
            transaction for the first time as sales soar of debt tied to
            skyscrapers, hotels and shopping centers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment manager is teaming with Raith Capital
            Partners, a New York-based real estate debt firm, in purchasing
            the B-piece, designated as the first to take any losses, in an
            upcoming deal from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said two people
            familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be identified
            because it hasn't been announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lured by higher returns with the Federal Reserve (FDTR) holding
            benchmark interest rates at about zero percent since 2008,
            AllianceBernstein is joining hedge funds Saba Capital Management
            LP, Ellington Management Group LLC and Perella Weinberg Partners
            LP in making debut B-piece purchases this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in those portions traditionally included real
            estate specialists such as Rialto Investments and Eightfold Real
            Estate Capital, which last year purchased 16 of the 27 B-pieces
            issued, according to data from Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives from AllianceBernstein, Raith and Perella
            didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment and
            spokesmen at Goldman Sachs, Saba and Ellington declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of commercial mortgage-backed securities are poised
            to climb by more than 50 percent to $70 billion in 2013,
            according to Credit Suisse Group AG. Banks have arranged about
            $36.6 billion this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Sachs Trader's Request on Scheme Claim Opposed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            trader Fabrice Tourre's request to exclude a scheme liability
            claim was opposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
            in its lawsuit over collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This court should deny the defense motion to preclude
            evidence or argument concerning Tourre's scheme to defraud and
            his transactions, practices and courses of business that
            operated as a fraud or deceit on others,' the SEC said in a
            filing today in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre said in a May 30 motion that the SEC for three years
            has accused him of making misleading statements and omissions,
            not of participating in a scheme to defraud investors. The SEC
            only sought to press a scheme liability claim in court filings
            two months ago, Tourre said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This abrupt pivot to scheme liability is undoubtedly
            driven by the SEC's well-founded concern that certain evidence
            it would like to introduce against Mr. Tourre is inadmissible
            under the misstatements theory that has been the basis of the
            SEC's case for over three years,' according to Tourre's May 30
            filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC initially sued the London-based trader in April
            2010, saying he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge
            fund Paulson Co. helped pick the underlying securities for a
            collateralized debt obligation called Abacus 2007-AC1 with the
            intention of betting against them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After reaching a $550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SEC filed a new
            claim against Tourre,
            saying he gave the company 'substantial assistance' as it
            misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is scheduled for trial July 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sean Coffey, Tourre's lawyer, said he hadn't seen the SEC's
            filing yet and couldn't comment on it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Warns on Korea Bonds as GS Caltex Shows Demand Still Hot</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in Europe and U.S. bought
            half of GS Caltex Corp.'s dollar bonds this week as Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. warns demand from developed markets is making
            yield premiums on top Korean names too tight. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Seoul-based oil refiner is paying a 3 percent coupon on
            its $400 million of notes, the lowest yet for its sales in the
            U.S. currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spreads
            on South Korean dollar bonds average 139 basis points more than
            Treasuries this year, JPMorgan Chase Co. indexes show, the
            least since 2007, before the collapse of Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc. and the global financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developed-market money managers' search for yield, as well
            as onshore investor demand, is making Korea's dollar bonds a
            less attractive bet, according to a June 12 Goldman Sachs
            report. Spreads for top-rated non-financial companies are an
            average 50 basis points more than their U.S. peers, compared
            with 120 basis points about a year ago, the New York-based
            investment bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see limited upside given the tight spreads,' analysts
            led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote. 'We see better value
            elsewhere in Asia investment grade, even though we believe
            search-for-yield motives will likely keep Korean spreads
            tight.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Far East Horizon Ltd., part owned by China's biggest
            supplier of chemical products, Sinochem Group, is meeting
            investors from today for a proposed dollar bond sale, people
            familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified
            because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sales Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. sold $1 billion of Tier 2
            subordinated bonds at 175 basis points more than Treasuries
            yesterday, while Goodman Hong Kong Logistics Fund borrowed $400
            million at a 180 basis-point spread. The issues contributed to
            the $3.3 billion of sales this week, down 36 percent from the
            previous five business days, Bloomberg-compiled data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds against
            non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region climbed to the highest in
            a week today, credit-default swap prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
            borrowers outside Japan rose 2 basis points to 105 basis points
            as of 8:34 a.m. in Singapore, Standard Chartered Plc prices
            show. The gauge is set for its highest close since June 5,
            according to data provider CMA. On the week, it's poised for a
            3.8 basis-point climb after falling for the past six periods. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 1 basis point to 70
            as of 9:42 a.m. in Tokyo, Mizuho Securities Co. prices show. The
            measure is at its highest level since June 6 and set to rise for
            a fourth-straight day, the longest series of increases since
            March 14, CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 2 basis points to
            83.75 basis points as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, National
            Australia Bank Ltd. prices show. The benchmark, on track for its
            biggest one-day gain in a week, last closed higher on June 5,
            CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The indexes are benchmarks for insuring bonds against
            default and traders use them to speculate on credit quality. A
            drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an
            increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Wins Dismissal of $450 Million Mortgage-Bond Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
            dismissal of a suit over $450 million in residential mortgage-backed securities, with a New York judge
            saying that the firms
            that bought the bonds should have done more research beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos dismissed the
            claims against Goldman Sachs today, saying the investors only
            reviewed data presented in offering documents for the securities
            and never asked to review files for the underlying loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The true nature of the risk being assumed could,
            admittedly, have been ascertained from reviewing these loan
            files and plaintiffs never asked for them,' Ramos wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was among financial firms including Bank of
            America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase Co. sued over more than $1.8
            billion in mortgage-backed securities in 2012 by Phoenix Light
            SF Ltd., a company based in Dublin that inherited claims from
            six legal entities 'that collapsed or nearly collapsed,'
            according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The entities include WestLB, the 180-year-old German state-owned lender, based in Dusseldorf, that
            ceased operations in
            2012 as part of European Union conditions tied to a 17 billion-euro ($23 billion) bailout after the 2008
            financial crisis,
            according to a complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
            part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
            worst recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
            and the market for the securities evaporated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Request &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs said Goldman Sachs didn't share the files
            for the loans underlying the securities. Ramos said there were
            no allegations that that they asked for them and Goldman Sachs
            denied access. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It does not matter if the failure to seek this
            information was because of blind faith in the process of
            origination and/or securitization, or if it was attributable to
            the desire to quickly get on board of what the investors thought
            was a profitable bandwagon,' the judge wrote. 'The obligation
            of a sophisticated investor to inquire cannot be merely
            excused.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nathan Lindell, an attorney with Robbins Geller Rudman
            Dowd LLP representing the plaintiffs in the case, didn't
            immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on the
            ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn't
            immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Phoenix Light SF Ltd. v. Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc., 652356/2013, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former Goldman Trader Sues to Get $20 Million in Bonuses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            trader who helped lead the firm's bets against subprime
            mortgages before the financial crisis asked a court to throw out
            an arbitration ruling denying him more than $20 million in
            unpaid compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem encountered a 'kangaroo court' and a
            'shocking and blatant miscarriage of justice' as Financial
            Industry Regulatory Authority arbitrators didn't allow him to
            call some of Goldman Sachs's top trading executives as
            witnesses, he said in a complaint today in New York State
            Supreme Court. Salem, 35, said in the complaint that members of
            the industry-funded regulator's arbitration panel called his
            case 'ridiculous' and 'bulls---' during a hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salem left the firm in May 2012, a year after a U.S. Senate
            subcommittee said he and other Goldman Sachs traders tried to
            manipulate prices of derivatives linked to subprime home loans
            in 2007 for their own benefit. The subcommittee's assertions
            were based in part on Salem's discussion of an attempted short
            squeeze in his self-evaluation, a finding which Salem said 'put
            too much emphasis on 'words,'' according to the Senate report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The three-person Finra arbitration panel said in a March 17
            decision to dismiss his case that even if the witnesses said
            what Salem maintained they would, he hadn't established a
            legally enforceable claim for the bonus money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Employees trade their rights to go litigate in court and
            get smart judges to review their circumstance in exchange for an
            expedited hearing on the merits,' Jonathan Sack, Salem's
            lawyer, said in a telephone interview. 'Deeb Salem got
            neither.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'A Scapegoat' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sack said his client was 'used as a scapegoat' by Goldman
            Sachs after criticism of the firm. Salem left the bank on his
            own accord and started at New York-based hedge-fund firm
            GoldenTree Asset Management LP a few months later. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His arbitration claim seeks $6.15 million in deferred
            compensation, $10 million in 'bonus true-up' for 2010 and
            2011, and $5 million as a pro-rata bonus for his 2012 work. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin Zern, chairman of the arbitration panel, didn't
            return a phone message left at a listed number. Tiffany Galvin,
            a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said the firm
            wouldn't comment on litigation and Finra's Michelle Ong declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Company documents show Goldman Sachs traders in 2007 sought
            to encourage a 'short squeeze' by putting artificially low
            prices on derivatives that would gain in value as mortgage
            securities fell, according to a 2011 report by the Permanent
            Subcommittee on Investigations. The idea, abandoned after market
            conditions worsened, was to drive holders of such credit-default
            swaps to sell and help Goldman Sachs traders buy at reduced
            prices, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Short Squeeze &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We began to encourage this squeeze, with plans of getting
            very short again,' Salem said in a 2007 self-evaluation
            excerpted in the report. In interviews with the committee, Salem
            denied attempting a short squeeze and 'claimed that he had
            wrongly worded his self-evaluation,' the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Salem v. Goldman Sachs Co., 651811/2014, New
            York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Crop Price Decline Top Commodity Opportunity at Goldman Sachs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The downside potential for
            agriculture prices is the biggest trading opportunity across
            commodity markets for analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as
            production recovers, according a report from the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank recommends initiating a short position for new-crop corn and soybeans, analysts Damien
            Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday. Goldman lowered its
            forecast to $4.75 a bushel for corn and to $11 a bushel for
            soybeans in three, six and 12 months. That compares with a
            previous prediction of $5.25 and $12.50 for six and 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn, soybean and wheat futures that surged as drought cut
            output in 2012 have tumbled into bear markets this year on
            expectations harvests will rebound. Record U.S. corn output will
            more than double inventories before the harvest in 2014, and
            soybean production will be an all-time high, the U.S. Department
            of Agriculture said June 12. Corn futures are the second worst-performing commodity on the Standard Poor's
            GSCI gauge of 24
            raw materials this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While U.S. corn and soybean production levels remain
            uncertain, we still expect that production will recover relative
            to last year's level under most weather outcomes,' the report
            said. 'It will require a significant weather shock to limit the
            rebuild in corn and soybean inventories given the record large
            realized South American harvests and current weak global
            consumption.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank recommended a basket short two December 2013 corn
            contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade and short one November
            2013 soybean contract as it sees a lower soybean to corn price
            ratio under most weather outcomes, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we may be too early in entering this trade, we
            prefer that to being late given our belief that current prices
            embed a large weather premium and that prices could decline in
            the next six weeks,' the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Guggenheim Partners LLC, the debt
            manager with more than $180 billion in assets, hired Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s co-head of U.S. leveraged finance capital
            markets Tom Stein. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stein, who will start in September, will report to Michael
            Damaso and Anthony Minella co-heads of corporate credit,
            according to Thomas Mulligan, a spokesman for Guggenheim at
            Sitrick and Co. Stein will will focus on the firm's capital
            market business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Stein
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stein, who co-headed the leveraged finance unit at Goldman
            Sachs with Kevin Sterling and David Lischer, joined the firm in
            2005 from Wachovia Corp. Stein previously served on the board of
            directors of the New York-based trade group, the Loan
            Syndications and Trading Association. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There have been $531.6 billion of leveraged loans arranged
            in the U.S. this year, an increase from $285 billion during the
            same time period in 2012, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below BBB-by
            Standard Poor's and less than Baa3 at Moody's Investors
            Service. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees No Winners in Platinum Strike as Final Deal Awaited</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Neither South Africa's dominant
            platinum union nor the top three producers it has targeted in an
            almost five-month pay strike will emerge as winner from the
            standoff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies will be left with damage to some mines and
            delays while they get their workforce back up to speed, while
            the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union will fall
            short of delivering for members on their demands, Goldman Sachs
            said in a June 13 note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Union members late last week accepted a pay proposal 'in
            principle' from Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS), Impala Platinum
            Holdings Ltd. (IMP) and Lonmin Plc. (LMI) The AMCU has said it has
            conditions to put to the companies before agreeing to a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are not expecting any developments until the long
            weekend is over,' Alan Fine, a Johannesburg-based spokesman
            representing the producers, said in an e-mail today. June 16 is
            a public holiday in South Africa. AMCU Treasurer Jimmy Gama
            didn't answer a call or respond to a text message seeking
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The union's members have been on strike since Jan. 23 in
            support of their demand to more than double basic monthly pay to
            12,500 rand ($1,165). The producers' latest offer includes wage
            increases of as much as 1,000 rand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AMCU members have raised conditions on issues including the
            length of the agreement, back pay, increases in living-out
            allowances and the reinstatement of jobs, union President Joseph Mathunjwa said at rallies last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Slightly Improved' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the deal is only slightly improved for workers
            compared to the offer which was proposed within a month of the
            strike,' and was accepted by the union because of pressure from
            members, Eugene King, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in in the
            note. 'Mines will be damaged as panels will have collapsed,
            while organizing and retraining workers will take time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The three companies said they have lost 22.8 billion rand
            ($2.1 billion) in revenue in the longest and costliest strike in
            South Africa, source of about 70 percent of the global platinum
            mined. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Lonmin will likely rebound strongly post-strike as
            inventory can be converted to cash quickly and the mining
            restart will see concentrate coming through' in the next two
            months, King wrote. Impala will be confronted by delays to new
            shafts following the strike, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Point72 Is Said to Hire Goldman Sachs's Onoe as Japan Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Point72 Asset Management LP, Steven
            A. Cohen's family office, hired Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. prime
            broker Seiji Onoe to head its Japan operations, said a person
            with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Onoe will start his new job at the successor company to
            Cohen's hedge-fund firm SAC Capital Advisors LP in July, said
            the person, who asked not to be identified as the information is
            private. Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Point72 at Sard
            Verbinnen Co. in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Employees are leaving global banks, which are facing
            tighter regulatory and public scrutiny on capital, trading
            activities and compensation after the 2008 global financial
            crisis. Against this backdrop, such moves can be considered
            rational career management decisions, whereas seven or eight
            years ago they could have been more negatively perceived, said
            Paul Smith, the CFA Institute's Asia-Pacific managing director. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Opportunities in the banking sector are becoming harder
            to come by as traditional forms of financing continue to be
            squeezed by a combination of increasing regulation, the need to
            deleverage balance sheets and investors' lack of trust and
            confidence in the sector,' Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Onoe will oversee the Stamford, Connecticut-based company's
            Japan staff, including fund managers and analysts, in the newly
            created position, the person said. He will be responsible for
            business development, regulatory compliance, professional
            development and performance management of the Japan team, said
            the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Millennium Hire &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among others, Millennium Management LLC hired Kazutoshi Ohkubo, former Barclays Plc head of Japan
            equities, as chief
            executive officer for its business in the country, two people
            with knowledge of the matter said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SAC agreed in November to pay a record $1.8 billion and
            plead guilty to securities fraud to settle allegations of
            insider trading. As part of the settlement, Cohen agreed to
            close SAC and return client money. Point72 oversees about $10
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Onoe spent more than 10 years at Goldman Sachs, most
            recently as an executive director for prime brokerage sales in
            Tokyo. He also worked on the equity sales team, said the person.
            Banks' prime brokerage units provide services to hedge funds
            such as clearing trades, lending stocks and cash, and linking
            them to potential investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Moore Capital &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miyako Takebe, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs,
            declined to comment, citing a company policy of not confirming
            departures. Onoe could not immediately be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steve Glynn, a former Morgan Stanley managing director,
            joined Moore Capital Management LLC as a Hong Kong-based fund
            manager, Sharron Silvers, a spokeswoman at Burson-Marsteller in
            New York for the hedge-fund firm with $14.9 billion of assets
            and run by Louis Moore Bacon confirmed today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Glynn, Asia-Pacific head of fixed income at his resignation
            in March, spent 14 years at the Wall Street bank, Nick Footitt,
            a Hong Kong-based spokesman said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former Goldman Director Gupta Reports to Federal Prison</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            Director Rajat Gupta, convicted of insider trading in a scheme
            masterminded by hedge fund billionaire Raj Rajaratnam, joined
            his co-conspirator in a Massachusetts federal prison to begin
            serving a two-year sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gupta, 65, reported today to the Federal Medical Center
            Devens, where he's assigned to a minimum-security satellite
            camp, said Ed Ross, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
            Prisons. Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year sentence in the
            complex's medical prison. While the facilities are separate, it
            is possible the two could cross paths, Ross said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gupta last week failed in a last-ditch effort to remain
            free while he appeals his conviction. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg refused to order his
            continued release on bail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gupta today lost his appeal of a $13.9 million civil fine
            by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal
            appeals court in New York upheld the fine and an order
            permanently barring him from acting as an officer or director of
            a public company and from associating with any broker or
            investment adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Highest Profile &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A former McKinsey Co. managing partner, Gupta is the
            highest-profile executive convicted in a U.S. crackdown on
            insider trading at hedge funds. Since August 2009, prosecutors
            in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara have
            charged 86 people with insider trading, with 81 cases resulting
            in convictions, mostly through guilty pleas. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Rating Lowest Ever in Calm-Market Casualty</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The big trend among the young and
            restless in New York this summer is to bash Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. interns on Yik Yak, an anonymous social-media app. The big
            trend for analysts covering Goldman is to bash the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average rating on Goldman Sachs shares has fallen to
            3.21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that assigns a
            score of 5 to ratings of buy or the equivalent, 3 to holds and 1
            to sells. Apart from some similar scores earlier this year,
            Goldman's rating has never been lower in data starting in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Here's a sample of the ribbing the summer associates are
            taking on Yik Yak: 'GS interns clap when the plane lands.'
            Here's a sample of what analysts are saying about Goldman Sachs:
            Trading revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies
            will drop 16 percent this quarter, according to Sanford C.
            Bernstein Co.'s Brad Hintz, who on June 5 cut his second-quarter earnings estimates by 8 percent to $3.35 a
            share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The slump in Goldman's ratings, not to mention the 6
            percent drop in its stock this year, is a casualty of the
            pervasive calm that has overtaken financial markets and sent
            measures of volatility in various asset classes to multi-year,
            if not record, lows. Citigroup Inc. has warned of a drop of as
            much as 25 percent in second-quarter trading revenue and
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Never Move' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn said at an investor
            conference last month: 'What drives activity in our business is
            volatility. If markets never move or don't move, our clients
            really don't need to transact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts on average predict Goldman's earnings per share
            before unusual items will slide 16 percent this quarter, 2
            percent next quarter and 9 percent in the final three months of
            the year before rebounding 8 percent in all of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's 3.21 analyst rating ranks the stock 68th among 83
            financial stocks in the SP 500 and 14 percent below the average
            3.72. Banks less reliant on trading revenue are faring better.
            JPMorgan Chase ranks 11th among financials with a 4.3 rating;
            Citigroup's is 4.1; Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo Co. are
            each at about 3.9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For the entire SP 500, Goldman's consensus rating ranks it
            440th and 16 percent below the average of 3.84. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman's shares outperformed the benchmark stock
            index by more than 9 percentage points in 2013 and 28 percentage
            points in 2012, its 139 percent return including dividends is
            far behind the SP 500's 220 percent return and an almost 300
            percent jump for financial shares since the start of the bull
            market in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You can't blame the summer interns for that. Even if,
            according to Yik Yak, they all wait for the light to change
            before crossing the street. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Egyptian Twinkies Maker Said Set to Hire Goldman Sachs for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Edita Food Industries, the Egyptian
            snacks maker part-owned by buyout firm Actis LLP, is close to
            hiring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to help manage its initial
            public offering, three people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, whose products include the Twinkies cake in
            Egypt, may appoint a second bank to assist on the expected share
            sale in Cairo, the people said, asking not to be identified as
            the information is private. The IPO may be valued at about $300
            million, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Egyptian companies are reviving share sales as they seek to
            benefit from a more than 20 percent gain in Egypt's benchmark
            EGX 30 index this year. A $110 million IPO of Arabian Cement
            last month, the country's first since the 2011 uprisings,
            received $1.5 billion in bids from institutional and individual
            investors, according to EFG-Hermes Holding SAE. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edita is the largest independent snack food business in
            North Africa, Actis said in June 2013 when it bought a $102
            million stake in the company. Representatives at London-based
            Actis and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Edita officials did
            not immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Trader Says Bonus Cut to $8.25 Million Unfair</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader who said he helped the bank earn more
            than $7 billion, wants to be paid the almost $5 million difference between his 2010 bonus and what he told
            his mother to expect. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem said in an arbitration hearing that he was led to believe
            that his 2010 bonus would be $13 million, down from a $15 million award for 2009 when he was paid more than
            Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein. Instead, Salem said his bonus was unfairly docked because of a
            written warning he received about his 2007 self-evaluation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem, 35, said the $8.25
            million bonus for 2010 didn't reflect his contributions, while Goldman Sachs argued he was aware that the
            firm could pay him whatever it wished and that the company considered his conduct in determining
            compensation. Salem said promises from executives kept him around for another year before a $3 million bonus
            led him to jump to a hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Let's be very clear: I was one of the most
            sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry,' Salem said during the Feb. 25 hearing. 'I
            had the opportunity throughout the course of my career and throughout -- from that day, from almost every
            month that I was at Goldman, to leave for other opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Traders Pare Bets for Russia Cuts as Goldman Notes Risk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Traders are scaling back bets for
            lower interest rates in Russia over the next three months after
            the central bank warned that inflation threatens to drive
            borrowing costs higher. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In keeping the benchmark at 7.5 percent two days ago,
            policy makers led by Chairman Elvira Nabiullina said they could
            raise rates if 'inflation risks materialize.' The market is
            'prematurely' pricing in cuts from the third quarter as food
            drives consumer-price growth to the highest level since 2011,
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a June 16 report. The discount
            on three-month forward-rate agreements fell to 24 basis points
            below the MosPrime rate from 63 at the end of last week as bets
            on lower borrowing costs eased, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the central bank expects the economy to expand the
            least since 2009 this year amid international sanctions slapped
            on Russia because of its incursion into Ukraine, inflation
            accelerated last month led by food prices after a ban on imports
            of pork from the European Union. A rate increase remains a risk
            before the central bank 'begins a cautious rate-cutting cycle'
            in the fourth quarter, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The central bank clearly showed that it's absolutely
            indifferent to economic growth, that inflation is its top
            priority,'Oleg Kouzmin, an economist for Russia and the
            Commonwealth of Independent States at Renaissance Capital in
            Moscow, said by phone yesterday. 'There was no rate hike but
            the statement was extremely hawkish.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Toughest' Statement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kouzmin, who worked as a consultant to the central bank's
            monetary policy department until last year, said it was the
            'toughest' statement he'd seen from the regulator. Renaissance
            extended its outlook for a rate cut to the fourth quarter of
            2014 from the third after the comments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the outlook for lower borrowing costs helped reduce
            the extra yield on two-year government ruble bonds over Bank
            Rossii's main rate to 67 basis points last week, matching the
            lowest gap of the past nine months, the spread was at 70 basis
            points as of 6:14 p.m. in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank has raised its benchmark by 200 basis
            points since February as the standoff with the U.S. and its
            allies over Ukraine intensified. Nabiullina told reporters in
            Moscow on June 16 she's 'very concerned' about economic growth
            declining 'steadily' and an increase in the inflation, now 7.6
            percent. Russia's economy will expand as much as 0.4 percent
            this year before recovering 'slowly' to 0.9 percent next year
            and 1.9 percent in 2016, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bank Reliance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Risks to the policy rate in the short term are to the
            upside,' Goldman economists Clemens Grafe and Andrew Matheny
            wrote in the note. 'The government bond curve has been pricing
            too many rate cuts over too short of a period of time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even amid caution about inflation, the central bank would
            be too worried about exacerbating the worsening cash shortage
            among lenders to raise interest rates, according to Konstantin Nemnov, who helps manage $3 billion as the
            head of fixed income
            at TKB BNP Paribas Investment Partners in St. Petersburg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian lenders have become more reliant on the central
            bank for funding as foreign investors are deterred by the
            escalating crisis in Ukraine. Central bank loans comprised 8.2
            percent of the banking industry's funding as of June 1, an
            increase from 5.4 percent at the start of 2013, its data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Economic Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruble is the third-worst performing developing-nation
            currency this year, down 4.8 percent versus the dollar. It has
            risen 1 percent this month, the second best in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VTB Capital's chief economist for Russia, Vladimir Kolychev, expects a 50 basis-point rate cut in
            the fourth
            quarter as inflation will dip below 6 percent this year. A
            further 50 basis points will follow in the first and second
            quarters of 2015, he said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market is expecting rate cuts this year, but less
            than a week ago,' Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske
            Bank A/S in Helsinki, said by e-mail yesterday. 'Now it's clear
            that the central bank is undoubtedly taking a hawkish stance, at
            least through the summer.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Peugeot Rises as Goldman Says Vehicle Pricing Improving</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG), Europe's
            second-biggest carmaker, rose the most in four months after an
            analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the manufacturer has
            been able to charge more for vehicles because of new models. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Executives from Peugeot 'highlighted significant
            progress' in its earnings-revival strategy during recent
            meetings, Justine Dingley, a London-based analyst at Goldman,
            said in a research report dated yesterday. An industrywide focus
            on profitability, 'along with PSA's attractive model portfolio,
            has helped it to improve price realization in Europe,' and to
            narrow the first-half loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peugeot jumped as much as 6.7 percent, the steepest
            intraday gain since Feb. 21, and was trading up 4.2 percent at
            10.44 euros at 5:17 p.m. in Paris. The stock has gained 34
            percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 8.16 billion euros
            ($11.1 billion). Jonathan Goodman, a spokesman at the company,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The carmaker sold 3 billion euros in stock earlier this
            year, and brought in Chinese partner Dongfeng Motor Corp. and
            the French state as investors, to finance a turnaround. Chief
            Executive Officer Carlos Tavares's strategy includes investing
            in hybrid drives, reorganizing operations in South America and
            Russian and scaling back the model lineup while turning the DS
            badge, currently a unit of the Citroen nameplate, into a full-fledged premium auto brand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, based in Paris, has been unprofitable since
            mid-2011, hurt by a contraction in Europe's car market that led
            to a two-decade low in industrywide demand last year. The
            company's sales in the region rose 4.2 percent in May, helped by
            demand for the 2008 compact sport-utility vehicle and 308
            hatchback. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Hatzius Says FOMC Could Lift Rate Forecasts in Dots</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jan Hatzius, chief economist at
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said Federal Reserve meeting
            participants could increase their forecasts for interest rates
            for 2015 and 2016 from their view in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is an economic argument for the dots to move up
            slightly,' Hatzius said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
            'The inflation numbers have been a little firmer, and the labor
            market numbers have generally been good. So you could see a
            slight move upward.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee, which releases its
            policy statement as well as forecasts at 2 p.m. today, has
            scaled back its monthly asset purchases in $10 billion
            increments at four consecutive meetings since December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chair Janet Yellen, who holds a press conference today, has
            said the FOMC will look at a wide range of data in determining
            when to raise its benchmark interest rate from zero. At a press
            conference in March, she warned against paying too much
            attention to the forecasts, which are depicted as dots on a
            chart. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A change in the composition of the FOMC 'might argue for
            more stability and the discussion around the long-term neutral
            rate is probably also a reason to expect if at all only a very
            small upward move in the 2015 and 2016 dots,' Hatzius said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co. has argued central banks
            will keep interest rates at a 'new neutral' rate because of
            slower global growth, with more stable top speeds. Fed officials
            have lowered their long-run estimate for U.S. growth to 2.2
            percent to 2.3 percent in March from 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent
            in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Trader Barred From Presenting Lawyers' Advice</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader
            Fabrice Tourre lost a bid to present evidence that he
            'reasonably relied' on the advice of lawyers when working on a
            transaction at the center of a fraud lawsuit filed by the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allowing Tourre to use that defense without meeting legal
            requirements ''would give the defendant all of the essential
            benefits of an advice of counsel defense without having to bear
            the burden of proving any of the elements of the defense,'' U.S.
            District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan ruled. Tourre's
            trial is scheduled to begin July 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC sued the London-based trader in April 2010, saying
            he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge fund Paulson
            Co. had helped pick the underlying securities for a
            collateralized debt obligation, or CDO, called Abacus and
            planned to bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After reaching a $550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SEC filed a new
            claim against Tourre,
            saying he gave the company ''substantial assistance'' as it
            misled investors. The SEC is also pursuing claims that Tourre
            violated securities laws related to ACA Management LLC's sale of
            protection on $909 million of the Abacus notes, which defaulted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre sought to offer evidence showing that: Paulson's
            counsel reviewed or was copied on various documents; counsel for
            ACA reviewed certain transaction documents; and in-house or
            outside counsel for Goldman Sachs drafted or reviewed disclosure
            language, according to Forrest's ruling issued late yesterday
            and made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Several Lawyers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trader also wanted to show that several people part of
            the process were lawyers, such as David Gerst, a member of the
            trading desk, who was an attorney at a law firm before joining
            at Goldman Sachs, Forrest said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;''It would be confusing and unduly prejudicial for Tourre
            to present extensive evidence on the presence and involvement of
            lawyers -- who are presumably paid to ensure that any
            disclosures comply with the relevant legal requirements -- while
            at the same time professing not to have relied on their advice
            in preparing or disseminating those disclosures,' Forrest
            wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre argued he was one of six people on the Goldman Sachs
            trading desk that worked on the transaction and that internal
            and external lawyers as well as the company's compliance
            department reviewed offering documents for the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fact that lawyers saw and commented on disclosure
            language could be understood as 'blessing' the sufficiency of
            that disclosure,' the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Primarily Responsible' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forrest said Tourre could use the words 'counsel,'
            'lawyer' and 'attorney' and present evidence 'tending to
            show that he was not the person primarily responsible for the
            transaction and that the transaction occurred in the context of
            a sophisticated financial institution.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pamela Rogers Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, declined to
            comment through Chris Kittredge, a spokesman for her at Sard
            Verbinnen Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment
            on Forrest's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transactions at issue in the case involved IKB Deutsche
            Industriebank AG (IKB), which allegedly lost almost all of its $150
            million investment, and ABN Amro Bank NV, which assumed the
            credit risk associated with a portion of the Abacus CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs 100-Year Bond Pitch Captivates Colombia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;After helping Mexico sell 100-year
            bonds overseas for the first time in 2010, Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. is seeking to do the same for Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Andean nation may issue the notes later this year after
            the New York-based bank offered to arrange the sale, Finance
            Minister Mauricio Cardenas said June 11. Goldman Sachs helped
            underwrite Mexico's offering of dollar bonds due 2110 as well as
            its pound-denominated century bonds in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia is seeking to exploit soaring demand for its
            longer-maturity debt as its economy grows twice as fast as the
            regional average and the Federal Reserve reiterates that
            interest rates will stay low for a 'considerable time' after
            it stops buying bonds. Yields on Colombia's $2 billion of bonds
            due in 2044, its longest-term notes, have plunged 0.67
            percentage point to 4.98 percent since they were issued Jan. 21.
            That's more than the average 0.48 percentage point decline in
            long-dated bonds with the same rating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Colombia shines in the midst of underperforming economies
            in emerging markets, and investors are noticing,' Mario Castro,
            a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc, said by phone from New
            York. 'There's no doubt there's appetite for Colombia risk, and
            Colombia would be getting long-term financing at still very low
            yields.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn't answer calls and messages seeking
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'General Receptiveness' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia would use funds from a sale to cover its 2015
            financing needs, Cardenas told investors at the June 11
            presentation. Goldman Sachs proposed a reference yield of around
            5.7 percent for a Colombian 100-year debt offering, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on Mexico's $2.68 billion of bonds due 2110 have
            fallen 0.67 percentage point this year to 5.55 percent, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mexico, whose BBB+ rating from Standard Poor's is one
            level higher than Colombia's, is the only nation to have issued
            100-year notes in both dollars and pounds. China and the central
            bank of the Philippines sold $100 million of century bonds in
            1996 and 1997, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There has been a general receptiveness to longer
            maturities recently,' Michael Roche, an emerging-market
            strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said by telephone from New
            York. 'Institutional investors, particularly pension funds and
            insurance companies, generally have a need for longer
            duration.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Growth Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's economy will grow 4.5 percent this year,
            compared with an average expansion of 2.7 percent in Latin
            America, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
            The economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a
            year earlier, the national statistics agency said today, higher
            than the 5.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,882.50 per dollar at the
            close today in Bogota. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The country's sale of 30-year bonds in January attracted
            $4.2 billion in bids, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government plans $3 billion in overseas debt offerings
            next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Appetite for Colombia's last bond sale was huge, and that
            shows there definitely is willingness to invest in the
            country,' said Nomura's Castro. Selling a century bond would be
            'another step in positioning Colombia in the international
            capital market. It's an exclusive club.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Trader Calls $8.25 Million Bonus Unfair, Told Mom He'd Get More</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deeb Salem, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader who said he helped the bank earn more
            than $7 billion, wants to be paid the almost $5 million difference between his 2010 bonus and what he told
            his mother to expect. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem said in an arbitration hearing that he was led to believe
            that his 2010 bonus would be $13 million, down from a $15 million award for 2009 when he was paid more than
            Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein. Instead, Salem said his bonus was unfairly docked because of a
            written warning he received about his 2007 self-evaluation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem, 35, said the $8.25
            million bonus for 2010 didn't reflect his contributions, while Goldman Sachs argued he was aware that the
            firm could pay him whatever it wished and that the company considered his conduct in determining
            compensation. Salem said promises from executives kept him around for another year before a $3 million bonus
            led him to jump to a hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Let's be very clear: I was one of the most
            sought-after investment professionals in the mortgage industry,' Salem said during the Feb. 25 hearing. 'I
            had the opportunity throughout the course of my career and throughout -- from that day, from almost every
            month that I was at Goldman, to leave for other opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Emerging Markets Era of Outperformance Is Ending, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The decade-long outperformance of
            developing-nation assets has ended, according to the Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. economist who predicted the rise of the biggest
            emerging markets in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The five trends that spurred outsized gains during the past
            10 years -- surging growth in the so-called BRIC nations, higher
            commodities, improved government finances, slower inflation and
            lower U.S. bond yields -- are halting and in some cases
            reversing, Dominic Wilson, the chief markets economist at New
            York-based Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While cyclical opportunities will come and go, the era of
            structural outperformance for EM is probably over,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks, bonds and currencies tumbled today
            amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce monetary
            stimulus that has spurred $3.9 trillion of capital inflows into
            developing nations during the past four years. Wilson, who
            predicted Brazil, Russia, India and China would join the ranks
            of the world's largest economies in a 2003 research report while
            working with economist Jim O'Neill, now says their contribution
            to global growth is peaking. O'Neill, who retired from Goldman
            Sachs this year, coined the BRIC moniker in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index sank 3.2 percent to an 11-month low of 916.17 at 8:32 a.m. in New
            York, while currencies
            in India, the Philippines and South Korea weakened more than 1
            percent and South African bond yields surged. Fed Chairman Ben
            S. Bernanke said yesterday policy makers may start reducing debt
            purchases and end the program in 2014 should risks to the U.S.
            economy abate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lower Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even with the recent losses, the MSCI emerging index has
            climbed about 214 percent since the end of 2002, compared with
            an 85 percent gain in the Standard Poor's 500 Index. (SPX) JPMorgan
            Chase Co.'s gauge of developing-nation currencies has returned
            103 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over the next decade, EM assets are unlikely to deliver
            the kind of risk-reward that investors had become used to in the
            last one,' Wilson wrote. 'And absolute returns will likely be
            much lower.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jan Dehn, the head of research at Ashmore Investment
            Management, says declines in emerging markets are a buying
            opportunity because valuations have gotten cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI gauge trades for 1.4 times net assets, a 28
            percent discount versus the MSCI World index of developed-nation
            shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares
            with an average discount of less than 1 percent during the past
            five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Relative Value &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The right thing to do here, obviously, is to buy,' Dehn
            said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valuations in developing-nation debt and currency markets
            have become more expensive in the past decade, according to
            Wilson. The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
            government bonds over Treasuries has dropped to about 1.1
            percentage point from 4 percentage points, excluding Argentina
            and Venezuela, he wrote. The average emerging-market currency is
            now 10 percent overvalued, according to Wilson, who cited a
            Goldman Sachs model. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The economist said investors may need to focus on country-specific drivers, instead of relying on a
            repeat of the
            widespread rally in emerging markets that defined the last
            decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What we may be seeing is a return to conventional EM
            investing, where differentiation rather than broad exposure to
            the asset class becomes a larger part of the investment
            process,' Wilson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman to Buy RCO Tollway Stake as ICA Seeks Cash</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*), Mexico's largest
            construction company, will sell its minority stake in a Mexican
            tollway operator to partner Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and use the
            proceeds to pay short-term debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mexico City-based builder said it expected to receive
            5.07 billion pesos ($380 million) from the sale of its 18.7
            percent stake in Red de Carreteras de Occidente, which is
            majority-owned by Goldman Sachs. The deal needs approval by
            Mexico's antitrust regulator and the Ministry of Communications
            and Transportation, ICA said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICA shares have tumbled more than 30 percent since May 16,
            the day before Moody's Investors Service downgraded the
            company's credit rating citing its high leverage and delays in
            public-works spending by President Enrique Pena Nieto. The
            company's sales dropped 27 percent in the first quarter while
            debt climbed 14 percent to 54.2 billion pesos from its Dec. 31
            level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are significantly strengthening our financial
            position,' ICA Chief Executive Officer Alonso Quintana said in
            the statement. 'The sale of ICA's investment in RCO is a clear
            example of our strategy of selective recycling of capital in our
            asset portfolio and creating value for ICA's shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICA fell 2.8 percent to 21.28 pesos at 9:18 a.m. in Mexico
            City as Mexico's benchmark IPC index dropped 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Moncler Said to Pick Six Firms Led by Goldman, BofA to Run IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Moncler picked six securities firms
            led by Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
            manage an initial public offering as soon as this year,
            according to three people with direct knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offering may raise 800 million euros ($1 billion) to 1
            billion euros as investors sell 30 percent to 35 percent of the
            company, one person said. Mediobanca SpA (MB) will also be a global
            coordinator of the IPO, while Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP), JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and UBS AG (UBSN) will be joint bookrunners along with the
            global coordinators, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified before the company makes an announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moncler is planning an IPO in Italy for the second time in
            two years, allowing French private-equity firm Eurazeo to reduce
            its stake after it bought 45 percent of the company in 2011 when
            the maker of ski jackets abandoned the earlier listing. The
            purchase, in which Eurazeo replaced Carlyle Group as Moncler's
            largest investor, valued the clothier at no less than 1.2
            billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An external spokeswoman for Eurazeo and a spokesman for
            Milan-based Moncler, Domenico Galluccio, declined to comment on
            the IPO plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moncler may separate the luxury apparel brand from its
            other clothing businesses ahead of the IPO, Chairman Remo Ruffini said in an interview in October. In
            addition to selling
            $1,395 ski jackets and $995 handbags under the Moncler brand,
            Moncler also owns the Marina Yachting, Henry Cotton's and Coast
            Weber Ahaus sportswear labels, and holds the license for
            Cerruti 1881. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Swaps Aiful Loan for 8% Bond Luring Funds: Japan Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is set to
            get bonds with more than double the interest rate local Japanese
            banks will receive on loans when Aiful Corp. (8515) refinances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The consumer lender, which postponed repayments to avoid
            bankruptcy in 2009, said June 13 it will exchange part of 161.7
            billion yen ($1.6 billion) of debt for notes bearing an 8
            percent coupon. While that's in line with U.S. notes with
            similar credit scores, it's among the highest for Japanese bonds
            in the past 15 years, data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch show. Domestic banks will extend new loans
            at about 3 percent, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Local banks are accepting lower interest because they have
            collateral on loans to Aiful, while the debentures won't be
            secured. The consumer lender is seeking to refinance for a
            second time in five years as Bank of Japan stimulus lowers
            funding costs and the burden of refunding customers for excess
            interest-rate charges declines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A coupon of 8 percent looks very attractive,' said
            Taketoshi Tsuchiya, a senior executive at Mizuho Securities Co.
            who heads a team dealing with distressed fixed income. 'We've
            had a number of requests from overseas hedge funds saying they'd
            like to buy the bonds if they come on the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Informal Agreement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Aiful have reached an informal agreement
            that the U.S. bank will apply to swap loans for notes, according
            to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be
            identified because the details are private. Aiful triggered
            Japan's first auction to determine the payout of credit-default
            swaps when it obtained lender approval to postpone repayment on
            280 billion yen in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japanese banks may be avoiding the risk of default by
            extending loans with collateral, according to Junichi Shimizu, a
            Tokyo-based credit analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While the principal on loans gradually decreases as
            payments are made, corporate bonds are repaid at one go, so
            there's the risk of a default depending on the business
            environment,' Shimizu said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Only one yen bond offered by bankrupt Takefuji Corp. had a
            higher coupon in the past 15 years than the Aiful notes to be
            issued to Goldman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Takefuji's securities issued overseas in 2009 paid 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Debt Repayment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aiful will obtain a loan from Japanese banks of a little
            under 80 billion yen with which it will repay part of its
            outstanding debts, according to a person familiar with the
            matter. Foreign creditors including Goldman Sachs will exchange
            more than 30 billion yen in liabilities for the new bonds due at
            the end of April 2020, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aiful will also postpone repayment of 52.7 billion yen of
            existing loans, it said in a statement on June 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In difficult negotiations, we were compelled to accept
            tough terms on the bonds,' said Kenichi Hashimoto, an Aiful
            spokesman. 'Realistically, there's not such a big difference
            between the rate and that being charged in secondary markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield on Aiful's 1.99 percent bonds due in
            October 2015 was 7.4 percentage points over sovereign notes,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Tokyo-based lender
            is graded CCC+ by Japan's Rating Investment Information Inc.,
            or the equivalent of seven steps below investment level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. corporate bonds with CCC or lower ratings had an
            average yield of 8.8 percent, while it was 9.2 percent for
            global notes with such scores, according to Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BOJ Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Borrowing costs have fallen in Japan as the BOJ buys about
            7 trillion yen of sovereign bonds a month to spur inflation. The
            benchmark 10-year debt yield has dropped 15 1/2 basis points, or
            0.155 percentage point, to 0.58 percent this year. The yen has
            gained 3.3 percent in 2014 to 101.93 per dollar as of 5:06 p.m.
            in Tokyo, after tumbling 18 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An investment unit of Goldman Sachs held 14.5 billion yen
            of Aiful's debt, while a unit of Barclays Plc (BARC) had 9.4 billion
            yen at the end of March, according to material provided by Aiful
            to shareholders. The company's single largest creditor was the
            banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc., the
            documentation showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
            declined to comment on the plan, as did Kyota Narimatsu, a
            spokesman at Barclays in Japan, and Hiroshi Kashimoto at
            Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Credit Event &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aiful's December 2009 agreement with creditors to delay
            debt repayment resulted in a dispute over whether the action had
            caused a so-called restructuring credit event. Buyers of Aiful
            credit-default swaps, which insure bondholders against
            nonpayment, had to wait three months for the International Swaps
            Derivatives Association to rule that the plan had triggered
            payouts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sellers of credit-default protection agreed in 2010 to pay
            holders 66.125 yen for each 100 yen of insured debt, in Japan's
            first credit default auction, according to bid administrators at
            the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aiful racked up 636.1 billion yen in net losses in the
            eight years ended March 31 as a crackdown on coercive lending
            practices and court rulings forced Japan's consumer lenders to
            repay billions of dollars in overcharged interest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That regulatory action led to the bankruptcy of Takefuji
            with 433.6 billion yen of liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aiful recorded a profit of 30.5 billion yen in the 12
            months ended March 31, its biggest in eight years and the third
            in succession. Interest repayments fell for a fourth year last
            fiscal year, dropping 57 percent to 33.1 billion yen from three
            years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As the business environment is improving, banks can
            increase their recovery rate by continuing to support Aiful and
            its turnaround,' said Shintaro Niimura, a credit analyst at
            Nomura Securities Co., Japan's largest brokerage. 'For
            investors rationally seeking a profit, they're emphasizing
            better repayment terms.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Real, Lira, Rand Must Weaken to Close Trade Deficit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's real, Chile's peso and
            Turkey's lira may fall 'significantly' to curtail widening
            current account deficits, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lira, South African rand and India's rupee would need
            to depreciate about 30 percent on a trade-weighted basis, while
            the real and peso need to fall about 20 percent, London-based
            analyst Themistoklis Fiotakis wrote in a note today. While the
            assessments aren't forecasts, they signal where the currencies
            'might ultimately belong,' the analyst said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currencies are among the worst performers in emerging
            markets over the past month, with the real falling 10 percent
            since May 21, as the Federal Reserve signaled plans to taper off
            monetary stimulus. Rising bond yields in U.S., Germany and Japan
            are attracting funds away from emerging markets, making it more
            difficult for the countries to finance the deficits in their
            current accounts, the broadest measure of international trade
            and service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A larger exchange rate depreciation might be necessary,
            which will bring external accounts back into full balance,'
            Fiotakis wrote. 'Although some of the recent shifts may prove
            to be overshoots in the short term, the EM bond and FX selloff
            of the last month is likely to constitute only a small part of a
            longer trend for EM assets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's current account deficit widened to a record $73
            billion in the year through May, equivalent to 3.2 percent of
            gross domestic product, according to a central bank report
            today. Chile's deficit reached 4 percent of the GDP in the first
            quarter, the widest since 1998, while Turkey's amounted to 5.9
            percent at the end of March, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

            and'over'and'over'and'over'and'over'again, the first rule of
            insider trading is just don't insider trade, but the second rule
            is: If you have inside information about an upcoming merger,
            don't buy short-dated out-of-the-money call options on the
            target. The SEC will get you! What I haven't emphasized,
            however, is that derivatives can be replicated in various ways,
            so you can use other options to get similar results without
            trading in the Forbidden Option.'This would not technically
            violate the second rule of insider trading, though I cannot
            wholeheartedly recommend it since it would violate the first. &lt;/p&gt;

            Levine &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;June 16 (Bloomberg View) --'Has anything good ever happened
            to an investment bank because of e-mail? I mean, I guess,
            probably. Certainly e-mail is the best way to tell an analyst to
            work all weekend without having to watch in person as the light
            goes out of his young eyes.'And it probably helps to, I don't
            know, coordinate complicated global businesses and so forth. But
            that's boring background stuff and hardly worth mentioning.

        <headline>Goldman Lowers Gold Forecast Through 2014 as Selloff Accelerates</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
            forecasts for gold through 2014 after selling quickened as
            investors priced in expectations of reduced asset purchases by
            the U.S. Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank cut its target for the end of this year to $1,300
            an ounce from $1,435 and lowered its prediction to $1,050 from
            $1,270 for the end of 2014. Investors are assuming an earlier
            tapering of quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate increase
            sooner than the bank's economists expect, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report
            dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold has fallen 23 percent this year, heading for the
            biggest annual drop since 1981, as speculation increased that
            the Fed would pare monetary stimulus that helped the metal cap a
            12-year bull run last year. Prices slumped to the lowest since
            September 2010 last week after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
            the central bank may slow its bond-buying program if the U.S.
            economy continues to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The momentum in gold prices leaves risk to current prices
            as skewed to the downside,' the analysts wrote. 'Medium term,
            we expect that gold prices will decline further given our U.S.
            economists' forecast for improving economic activity and a less
            accommodative monetary policy stance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold for August delivery on the Comex in New York slid 0.7
            percent to $1,282.60 an ounce as of 1:41 p.m. in Singapore after
            tumbling to $1,268.70 on June 21, the least expensive since
            Sept. 16, 2010. Investors sold 533.3 metric tons from bullion-backed exchange-traded products this year,
            wiping out more than
            $54 billion from the value of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETP Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holdings in ETPs declined to 2,098.605 tons on June 21, the
            least since February 2011, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. Assets are down 20 percent in 2013 after climbing
            every year since the first product was listed in 2003. Goldman
            expects ETPs to decline at a steady pace of 1 million ounces a
            month, 'slightly below their recent pace but twice as fast as
            we had previously expected,' the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman joins Credit Suisse Group AG and Societe Generale
            SA in predicting further declines. Prices will drop to an
            average of $1,200 in the fourth quarter, Societe Generale
            forecasts. Credit Suisse sees the metal at $1,100 in 12 months,
            according to Ric Deverell, head of commodities research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In April, when gold entered a bear market, a buying frenzy
            from China to India and the U.S. followed the biggest price drop
            in 30 years, driving prices up more than $150 an ounce. Russia
            and South Korea were among nations that added gold to reserves
            this year, after central banks around the world bought 534.6
            tons last year, the most since 1964, according to World Gold
            Council estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to expect that continued central bank gold
            buying will not be sufficient to offset this decline in
            prices,' the analysts wrote. 'Further, we would expect this
            decline in prices to coincide with rising jewelry demand, which
            we view as price responsive and not price setting.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley Could Fall Short of Capital Rules, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of New York
            Mellon Corp. are the two U.S. banks likely to have the largest
            capital shortfall if regulators double the so-called leverage
            ratio without exempting cash and government bonds, Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. analysts wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's Tier 1 leverage ratio is about 4.5 percent
            and Bank of New York's 3.9 percent, the farthest behind the 6
            percent requirement said to be under consideration, Goldman
            Sachs analysts led by Richard Ramsden said today in a note. The
            average Tier 1 leverage ratio for large banks is 5.5 percent,
            the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators are considering doubling the amount of
            capital the largest banks must hold to 6 percent of total
            assets, four people with knowledge of the talks said last week.
            Last year, rulemakers proposed implementing a 3 percent
            international requirement for what's known as the simple
            leverage ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bank of New York and Morgan Stanley screen as outliers as
            outsized cash/repo books meaningfully inflate their asset
            bases,' the analysts wrote. Both companies are based in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Commodities Dropping 5.5% After Iraq-Driven Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities are poised to decline
            5.5 percent over the next 12 months after climbing amid tensions
            in Iraq, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Energy prices will be 5 percent lower a year from now,
            precious metals will drop 15 percent and agricultural products
            will retreat 10 percent, the bank said in an asset-allocation
            report dated yesterday. Commodities will decline 4 percent in
            the next three months, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Despite the negative return we forecast after the recent
            rally driven by events in Iraq, we stay neutral commodities due
            to the hedging benefits they offer against these risks,'
            Goldman analyst Jeffrey Currie in New York said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent crude reached a nine-month high in London on June 19
            after Iraqi insurgents captured the northern city of Mosul and
            advanced to towns just north of Baghdad, sparking concern oil
            output might be interrupted in OPEC's second-largest producer.
            Gold futures touched the highest price since April 15 today in
            New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today Brent fell as much as 0.5 percent after Iraqi forces
            regained control of the Baiji refinery in the north from
            Islamist militants, and fighting has yet to spread to the south,
            home to more than three-quarters of the country's crude output.
            Saudi Arabia was the only producer in the Organization of
            Petroleum Exporting Countries that pumped more oil than Iraq
            last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Larger Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, risks in energy are 'skewed to the upside in an
            environment of heightened geopolitical risks and very limited
            OPEC spare capacity,' the Goldman analyst wrote. Precious
            metals will drop amid rising real interest rates, while
            agriculture prices are set to decline as inventories increase,
            according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodity prices as measured by the Standard Poor's GSCI
            Enhanced Commodity Index rose 3.4 percent so far this month and
            are up 7.1 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman forecast May 14 the enhanced index might have zero
            total return in three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
            months. The bank projected a 4 percent drop over 12 months in an
            April 13 note. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Currency Trader Cho Is Said to Start Macro Fund</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Steven Cho, a former Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. currency trader, plans to start a macro hedge fund, a
            strategy attracting investors seeking to profit from diverging
            global economic trends. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cho's New York-based Kings Peak Asset Management LP is
            scheduled to start in the fourth quarter, according to four
            people with knowledge of his plans, who asked not to be named
            because the fund is private. Cho, who was global head of spot
            and forward trading of G-10 currencies at Goldman Sachs,
            declined to comment. He left in April after 18 years at the
            bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Macro funds, which make bets on stocks, bonds, currencies
            and commodities, have underperformed the Standard Poor's 500
            Index every year since 2008, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg, in part because central banks have depressed interest
            rates, making it harder to profit from discrepancies between
            countries. Firms including Tudor Investment Corp. and Mariner
            Investment Group LLC, which deploy the strategy, have forecast
            divergence in monetary policies as some economies grow faster
            than others. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Central banks can't all keep doing the same thing in
            tandem,' said Maggie Ralbovsky, a managing director at Wilshire
            Associates, which advises hedge funds and their investors. 'The
            macro market, because of the divergence in conditions in
            different countries, is very prime for this kind of strategy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Volatility Index &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While some funds expect increased divergence, they may have
            to be patient. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said today
            policy makers can wait for the economy to absorb more slack
            before increasing interest rates and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair
            Janet Yellen said last week the Fed expects interest rates to
            stay low for a 'considerable time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's caused volatility to plunge across stocks, bonds and
            currencies. The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index fell to a
            record low 5.5 percent on June 19 from 11.8 percent a year ago.
            The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
            measures price swings in stocks, tumbled 12 percent on June 18
            to close at 10.6, the lowest level since February 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, investors are seeking returns derived from
            macroeconomic themes and less correlated to the stock market,
            according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. That's
            contributing to an increase in hedge-fund startups overall, with
            289 in the first quarter, compared with 244 in the prior three
            months. Industry assets have increased to a record $2.7
            trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bankers Leave &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top bankers and traders have exited the biggest Wall Street
            firms for more lucrative jobs at hedge funds, as regulation has
            intensified following the 2008 financial crisis and lower
            returns have pushed banks to cut the amount of revenue they set
            aside for compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
            investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
            industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
            bank's currency business had 'difficulty managing inventory'
            in the third quarter as the firm posted its worst fixed-income
            trading revenue since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are also facing at least a dozen regulators
            investigating allegations that traders colluded to rig
            benchmarks in the $5.3 trillion-a-day currency market. Cho's
            resignation was unrelated to the currency probe and he left on
            good terms, according to two people with knowledge of the
            matter, who asked not to be named because the information is
            private. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Tokyo FX Salesman Wako Ogawa Said to Resign</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Tokyo-based foreign exchange salesman Wako Ogawa is leaving the
            firm,
            according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogawa, 44, a vice president at Goldman Sachs Japan Co.,
            will leave the firm later this year to join a financial
            institution, the people said, declining to be identified because
            the matter is confidential. Goldman Sachs's Tokyo-based
            spokeswoman Hiroko Matsumoto declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ogawa, who joined Goldman Sachs in 2007, regularly appears
            as a commentator on TV Tokyo (9413)'s early morning financial news
            program, 'Morning Satellite.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks globally are seeing income from foreign exchange
            squeezed by a decline in market volatility as global central
            banks provide unprecedented liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG's Currency Volatility Index, which
            measures the market's expectation of future price swings for
            nine currency pairs, slumped to a record 5.3 percent on June 19.
            The index was as high as 15.8 percent in September 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranked 10th in global currency trading, up
            from 11th a year earlier, Euromoney reported in its survey of
            the market published this year, with a 2.5 percent share. The
            bank has seen its proportion of transactions shrink each year
            since 2010, the data show. Citigroup Inc. was the leader in the
            latest survey with a 16 percent share. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley to Goldman Cut Gold Forecasts on Fed Outlook</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley lowered its forecasts
            for gold, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG in paring
            estimates on prospects that the U.S. Federal Reserve will scale
            back monetary stimulus as the economy recovers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank cut its 2013 target to $1,409 an ounce from
            $1,487, reduced its prediction for 2014 to $1,313 from $1,563,
            and trimmed its 2015 estimate to $1,300 from $1,450. Morgan
            Stanley also lowered its gold and silver forecasts through 2018,
            analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts from BNP Paribas SA to Standard Bank Plc are
            cutting their outlook for gold as the precious metal heads for
            its biggest annual drop in more than three decades. Bullion has
            fallen 24 percent in 2013 after rallying for 12 years, slumping
            to the lowest level since September 2010 last week after Fed
            Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank may slow its
            bond-buying program if the U.S. economy continues to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With investor demand for safe-haven assets waning against
            the backdrop of a strengthening U.S. dollar and rising U.S. bond
            yields, market conditions for gold and silver have become
            markedly less favorable,' Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,276.09
            today after tumbling to $1,269.46 on June 21, the cheapest since
            Sept. 16, 2010. Investors sold 541.5 metric tons from bullion-backed exchange-traded products this year,
            erasing $56 billion
            from the value of the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETP Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Holdings in ETPs declined to 2,090.4 tons yesterday, the
            least since June 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Assets are down 21 percent in 2013 after climbing every year
            since the first product was listed in 2003, as waning investor
            faith turned more serious, said Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This historic and fundamental change in one of the key
            drivers of the gold bull market is highlighting a sharp decline
            in the desirability of this form of investment,' Richardson and
            Crane wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, which expects ETPs to decline at a steady pace of
            1 million ounces a month, cut its 2013 year-end price target to
            $1,300 from $1,435 and lowered the 2014 prediction to $1,050
            from $1,270. Investors are assuming an earlier tapering of
            quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate increase sooner than the
            bank's economists expect, analysts Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a June 23 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernanke said on June 19 that the central bank, which buys
            $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt each month, may begin
            reducing purchases this year and end the program in 2014. This
            will keep gold prices under pressure, according to James Steel
            and Howard Wen at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., who yesterday
            reduced their 2013 forecast to $1,396 from $1,542 and trimmed
            their 2014 estimate to $1,435 from $1,600. Credit Suisse Group
            Inc. lowered its estimates today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Offers Triple-Recourse Bonds Targeting AAA Buyers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is
            marketing a new type of bond designed to give investors access
            to top-rated assets as the supply of covered bonds and other
            high-grade securities continues to shrink. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) of notes are
            provisionally rated AAA by Standard Poor's and will be sold
            through FIGSCO Issuer Ltd., SP said in a statement. The bonds
            are secured by fixed-income assets and offer investors three
            levels of protection in the event of default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman is seeking to meet investor demand for the safest
            assets as AAA rated bonds become harder to find in Europe.
            Redemptions of covered bonds and U.K. RMBS are outpacing new
            issues in Europe as cheap central bank funding and regulatory
            pressure prompt lenders to trim balance sheets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The current context of the supply/demand imbalance in the
            markets is well known,' Societe Generale SA analysts led by
            Jean-David Cirotteau said in a report. 'A new senior secured
            bond backed by a portfolio of financial assets by a large U.S.
            investment firm is probably a good thing for hungry investors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Ramsay, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
            declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The collateral backing the AAA bonds will be transferred to
            FIGSCO through a total return swap with Goldman Sachs Mitsui
            Marine Derivative Products LP, a joint venture between the U.S.
            bank and Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., according to
            SP. The securities offer investors a claim on the assets
            backing the deal, as well as on Goldman and Mitsui if the joint
            venture defaults. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has set up a 10 billion-euro program to sell
            the debt. Goldman Sachs, Barclays Plc, Credit Agricole SA,
            Natixis, and UBS AG are holding investor meetings for the bonds
            this week, a person familiar with the matter said June 23. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Merges Health, Retail Investment-Banking Groups</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the top
            merger adviser this year, is combining its health-care and
            retail investment-banking groups amid a boom in deals involving
            pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kathy Elsesser and Francois-Xavier de Mallmann, co-heads of
            the retail team, will lead the new group with Marshall Smith,
            who runs the health-care unit, according to an internal memo
            obtained today by Bloomberg News. David Wells, a spokesman for
            New York-based Goldman Sachs, confirmed the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms have been seeking to boost efficiency as
            lower trading revenue and new capital rules damp returns. The
            combined group would be among the bank's largest by total
            investment-banking fees, trailing financial institutions and
            financial sponsors, according to data from New York research
            firm Freeman Co. covering the past three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The change will allow bankers to 'be deployed more widely
            across a broader client base,' Goldman Sachs's co-heads of
            investment banking, Richard J. Gnodde, David Solomon and John S. Weinberg, wrote in the memo. 'We see
            growing convergence
            between sub sectors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser this year on deals
            involving health-care companies, which this quarter announced
            about $200 billion of deals, the most ever, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The firm ranked second for retail deals,
            behind Morgan Stanley, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elsesser started working for Goldman Sachs in 1989, while
            de Mallmann and Smith joined in 1993 and 2005, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is an adviser to Allergan Inc. on Valeant
            Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s $54 billion hostile
            takeover bid, as well as to medical-device maker Covidien Plc on
            its $46 billion acquisition by Medtronic Inc. On retail deals,
            the firm is advising Safeway Inc. on its $9.1 billion sale to
            Albertsons LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dimon Joins Goldman Sachs Praising Court on Gay Marriage</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. praised the U.S. Supreme Court after a ruling
            today that struck down a federal law that denies benefits to
            same-sex married couples. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is good for our company and clients, but more
            importantly, it's the right thing to do,' JPMorgan Chief
            Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement from the New
            York-based bank, the largest in the U.S. by assets. 'The rights
            of all people are important and must be protected.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court overturned by a 5-4 majority the U.S. Defense of
            Marriage Act, rejecting many of the justifications for treating
            same-sex and heterosexual couples differently. The court also
            reinstated a judge's order allowing gay marriages in California,
            the nation's largest state by population. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some of the biggest financial firms have criticized
            prohibitions of same-sex marriage, saying the measures could
            make it harder to recruit staff. Insurer Chubb Corp., which
            highlights the benefits it offers to domestic partners, said in
            2011 that DOMA 'imposes burdens' on businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Marriage equality lowers burdens and challenges imposed
            on employers, and will lead to building successful businesses
            and a strong American economy,' New York-based Goldman Sachs
            said in an e-mailed statement. 'We strongly support the Supreme
            Court's affirmation today of marriage equality.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Cash Drives Dong Hybrid Debt to Record: Nordic Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Since Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            bought a stake in Dong Energy A/S last year, the utility's
            hybrid debt has soared to a record, boosting investor returns as
            the Danish firm uses the cash to rebuild its business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors holding Dong's 4.875 percent bond due 3013 have
            enjoyed a 14 percent return since the debt was issued in July
            last year and a 5.5 percent note maturing in 3005 gained 4.6
            percent. Creditors holding Vattenfall AB's 5.25 percent
            perpetual note received 4.3 percent in Sweden's biggest utility
            over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bringing in Goldman was a good idea,' Finance Minister
            Bjarne Corydon said in an interview at Denmark's parliament in
            Copenhagen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Half a year after Goldman's purchase of a stake in state-held Dong split the minority coalition of
            Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, investors are benefiting from the transaction.
            The Wall Street bank's $1.5 billion purchase of an 18 percent
            stake was part of a deal, made together with pension funds ATP
            and PFA, that helped cauterize losses after Dong failed to turn
            a profit on natural gas projects. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Put Option &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman, which bought the stake through its European
            merchant banking unit in a company named New Energy Investment
            S.a.r.l., has already seen the value of its stake grow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Horsens, Denmark-based utility Insero this month exercised
            a put option to sell a 1.8 percent stake in Dong to Denmark for
            942 million kroner. That price values all of Dong at more than
            50 billion kroner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dong was valued at 31.5 billion kroner ahead of Denmark
            selling shares worth 13.1 billion kroner to Goldman, pension
            funds ATP and PFA and a group of shareholders in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Insero's price was based on a 2005-2006 valuation with
            added interests minus dividends, Peter Brixen, the head of the
            unit that manages the ministry's stake, said in an e-mailed
            reply to questions. Other minority holders, such as SEAS-NVE and
            Syd Energi A/S, which control more than 10 percent, were also
            able to sell shares at the same terms at Insero. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Dong's 3013 hybrid bond eased to about 2.8
            percent this week, compared with 5.238 when it was issued in
            July last year. Its spread to the government yield curve has
            narrowed to about 264 basis points from a high of 355 basis
            points in January, a month after the government split. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Popular Protest &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman became the target of a popular protest in Denmark
            after it emerged in December that the investment bank will
            receive some veto rights over how Dong is managed in exchange
            for its capital injection. Goldman has said it plans to follow
            the current management's strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dong explores for oil and natural gas in the North Sea and
            is the world's biggest builder of offshore wind turbine parks.
            The company said yesterday net losses are narrowing and debt
            shrinking after it completed a program of cuts and asset sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to Jakob Magnussen, an analyst at Danske Bank
            A/S, Dong's hybrid bonds have also benefited from a general
            appetite from investors for yields and 'risk-taking.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He recommends investors to buy into Dong's two most recent
            hybrid bonds with call options in 2018 and 2022, respectively,
            as the bonds carry a limited risk to get extended. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dong has very solid financial metrics,' Magnussen said.
            'They're actually much better than the company's long-term
            targets, so we're expecting them to increase their leverage in
            the coming quarters. They want to lower their funds from
            operations to net debt margin to 30 percent from 55 percent
            currently after they received new equity from Goldman and the
            other shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>GE Said to Hire Goldman Sachs for Sale of CareCredit Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;General Electric Co. (GE) is seeking
            buyers for its CareCredit health-care financing division in a
            sale that may fetch $1 billion, according to two people with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to solicit
            bids, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
            the process is private. Second-round bids for CareCredit, part
            of GE Capital, were submitted about a month ago, one of the
            people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Selling CareCredit would extend Chief Executive Officer
            Jeffrey Immelt's efforts to shrink GE Capital as he boosts
            profit from industrial products such as locomotives and jet
            engines. GE Capital faces heightened regulatory scrutiny from
            the Federal Reserve, which identified it as a potential risk to
            the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, declined to
            comment in an e-mail. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman
            Sachs, didn't immediately return a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CareCredit is the largest issuer of consumer health-care
            financing in the U.S., according to the New York Attorney
            General's office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GE Capital had $538 billion in assets as of March 31,
            larger than all but six U.S. banks, according to data compiled
            by the Fed. The unit's $45 billion in revenue was 31 percent of
            Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE's total sales last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The potential sale was reported earlier by Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman-Backed Renew Leads Solar Auction Winners in India</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a clean-energy developer backed by Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc., won
            the
            most capacity in a government solar auction in the central
            Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ReNew was awarded a license to build a 30-megawatt
            photovoltaic plant after bidding to sell power at 6,970 rupees
            ($112) a megawatt-hour, according to S.R. Mohanty, secretary of
            new and renewable energy in the state. That's about 19 percent
            below the global average price for electricity generated by
            panels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India, the third-biggest energy consumer on Earth, plans a
            six-fold increase in solar capacity by 2017 to reduce blackouts
            as plunging panel prices help photovoltaic projects compete on
            costs with coal and gas-fired plants. The government is using
            competitive tenders to avoid European-style subsidies, where
            above-market tariffs for wind and solar farms are common. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madhya Pradesh awarded 100 megawatts of capacity in total.
            Developers promising to sell power at the cheapest rates won.
            Himgiri Energy Ventures offered the lowest bid of 6,470 rupees a
            megawatt-hour. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The winners also included Today Homes Infrastructure
            Pvt., Bhadresh Trading Corp., Ujaas Energy Ltd. (UJEL)'s unit KRBL and
            Focal Energy Holdings Ltd., according to a list sent by Mohanty. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank
            that was lead underwriter on Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s May bond offering,
            named the technology firm's chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, to its board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oppenheimer, 51, whose appointment expands the board to 13
            members, is joining immediately and will sit on all four of its
            committees, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, was
            chosen to underwrite the majority of Apple's then-record $17
            billion bond offering last year. It was the Cupertino,
            California-based company's first issuance in 17 years. Apple
            also hired Goldman Sachs in 2012 to help it improve transparency
            and governance, including what to do with its more than $100
            billion in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Peter's 25 years of broad experience across important
            industries will add a valuable perspective to our board of
            directors,' Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Citigroup Inc. (C) stepped up warnings to shareholders about
            cyber attacks as the U.S. prodded banks and government agencies to bolster their defenses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Online
            and mobile banking give new points of entry that can be used to disrupt or penetrate operations, the two New
            York- based firms said last week in annual regulatory filings. The companies said they're vulnerable to
            tactics that overload websites to shut off public access, such as assaults that disrupted the nation's
            largest lenders late last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks are speculating that foreign nations,
            organized crime or terrorists are behind efforts to cripple their websites and warning that costs to keep
            intruders at bay will rise. President Barack Obama directed the government on Feb. 12 to develop voluntary
            security standards for companies running vital infrastructure and is pushing Congress to set formal rules.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are going to see more disclosures, and that's a warning sign that things are really
            getting bad,' said Lawrence Ponemon, chairman of Ponemon Institute LLC, a Traverse City, Michigan-based
            security research firm, which predicts a 30 percent increase in expenses tied to cyber intrusions this year.

        <headline>Coverity Talks With Banks Including Goldman About IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Coverity Inc. has held talks with
            banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. about holding an initial public offering later this year,
            Chief Executive Officer Anthony Bettencourt said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company, which makes applications
            to detect errors in software, would look to raise less than $100
            million in an IPO for future acquisitions, Bettencourt said in
            an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coverity is on track for annual revenue of about $70
            million, and sales are growing at 30 percent a year, Bettencourt
            said. More than 1,100 customers, including Microsoft Corp.,
            Samsung Electronics Co. and the National Aeronautics and Space
            Administration, license Coverity's tools, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our eye is on the public markets,' Bettencourt said.
            'It helps with the credibility. It's nice to have a war chest
            in reserves.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, and Justin Perras, a spokesman at JPMorgan, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coverity raised $22 million from Foundation Capital and
            Benchmark Capital in 2008, and currently has $25 million in the
            bank and is cash-flow positive, Bettencourt said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Brazil Investment-Bank Chairman Said to Depart</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Daniel Wainstein, chairman of
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Brazil investment-banking business,
            will leave the company, two people with direct knowledge of the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been discussing the changes with
            Wainstein for the past several months, according to a person at
            the New York-based firm who asked not to be identified because
            the decision hasn't been announced. Wainstein, 42, and Andre Laport Ribeiro are Goldman Sachs's only
            partners in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein asked to leave after working at the firm since
            2000, one of the people said. He was appointed chairman of
            Brazil investment banking in April 2012, when Antonio Pereira
            and Fabio Bicudo were named co-chief operating officers. The
            bank ranked sixth in equity underwriting in Brazil last year,
            with $732 million in transactions, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. It was No. 8 among merger advisers with $14.3 billion in
            deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
            comment on Wainstein's departure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in October it would double capital in
            Brazil to 800 million reais ($407 million) while closing its
            asset-management business in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm, which doesn't disclose Brazil revenue or profit,
            named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country a year ago. Goldman
            Sachs has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on complex
            products with higher profit margins, such as convertible debt
            and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Local Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
            based companies such as Bradesco BBI SA, Banco Itau BBA SA and
            Banco BTG Pactual SA, which have used their stronger local
            contacts to squeeze out foreign firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
            service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
            local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
            Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
            Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
            an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
            back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
            BTG went public last year in a $1.94 billion initial offering
            that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. &lt;/p&gt;

            Isabelle Ealet and Ashok Varadhan, co-heads of the firm's
            securities division. He was named a partner in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
            has said his New York-based firm is committed to its commodities
            unit, even as rivals such as Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. exit parts of theirs. The Federal Reserve said earlier this
            year that it's considering new limits on banks' trading and
            warehousing of physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Karl has had a substantial commercial impact on our
            market-leading commodities franchise,' Ealet, Salame and
            Varadhan wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, World Bank Invest $132 Million to Finance Women</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the
            World Bank said they will invest $132 million to push banks in
            developing economies to lend to women-owned businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money will fund a new facility run by the World Bank's
            private-sector arm that will extend lines of credit and share
            risks with local banks to ensure they give female entrepreneurs
            access to financing for their small and medium-size companies.
            The two contributors plan to raise an additional $468 million
            from other investors, the World Bank said today in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gender equality is smart economics and a key driver of
            development,' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a
            speech in Washington announcing the partnership today. 'We need
            to do more so that investing in women becomes mainstream by
            businesses and financial institutions alike.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank estimates that women-owned companies face a $300
            billion credit gap, made worse in some countries by unfavorable
            regulation. Closing that gap would raise income per capita
            across the main developing economies, with Brazil and Vietnam
            gaining the most, according to Goldman Sachs research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The World Bank's International Finance Corp. unit will
            invest $100 million in the so-called Women Entrepreneurs
            Opportunity Facility, with Goldman Sachs providing $32 million,
            the World Bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, CPPIB Said to Offer Investors Childs Fund Exit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and the
            Canada Pension Plan Investment Board are set to invest in
            holdings from a 2002 fund managed by J.W. Childs Associates LP
            in a deal valued at $1 billion, said three people with knowledge
            of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buyout firm J.W. Childs will give existing investors an
            option to sell stakes in its $1.75 billion buyout fund to CPPIB,
            Canada's second-biggest public pension manager, and Goldman
            Sachs's asset-management unit, said the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to be valued at about $1
            billion, the people said. The J.W. Childs fund holds stakes in
            five companies, including Sunny Delight Beverages Co., Mattress
            Firm Holding Corp. and retailer Brookstone, according to the
            buyout firm's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal is the latest transaction in which private-equity
            managers are giving investors the chance to sell stakes or roll
            them into new vehicles. London-based Argan Capital began talks
            in January to sell holdings in the 425 million-euro ($583
            million) fund it manages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;John W. Childs, 72, and Adam Suttin founded Boston-based
            J.W. Childs in 1995. The firm hasn't raised a fund since 2002,
            abandoning efforts to raise another one in 2007, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spokeswomen for Goldman Sachs and Toronto-based CPPIB
            declined to comment. A spokesman for J.W. Childs didn't respond
            to e-mailed requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Friedman Sees Good Time to Buy Companies as Peers Sell</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Richard A. Friedman, head of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s merchant banking division, said he sees
            opportunities to invest in middle-sized companies as some other
            private-equity firms sell their investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'My peers, I see them at conferences, and they talk about
            how it's the greatest selling environment -- I actually think
            it's a good investing environment,' Friedman, 56, said today in
            a CNBC interview. 'We have continued improvement in the
            economy, we have very low interest rates and access to capital,
            and also for the first time, I'd say, in years, our CEOs can
            actually put business plans together with more confidence.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's merchant banking unit makes investments in
            private-equity and real estate assets using client funds and the
            company's own money. The firm's investments are included in its
            investing and lending segment, which produced $4.33 billion of
            pretax earnings in 2013, the most profit of any of Goldman
            Sachs's four business units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has said it's cutting its own stakes in private-equity funds to comply with the Volcker
            Rule, which limits such
            investments. Still, the firm can often make direct investments
            in debt or equity securities with its own money outside of fund
            structures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's merchant banking division has raised more
            than $82 billion for investment funds in corporate equity and
            debt since 1986, according to its website. The bank is
            considering a different strategy than buying large companies to
            take them private, which was popular before the financial
            crisis, Friedman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Not Happening' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What we're looking at is actually buying mid-sized
            companies or making early-stage investments and growing
            companies, as opposed to what happened in 2005 through 2007,
            which was a buying spree of taking companies private,' Friedman
            said. 'That's just not happening anymore.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Friedman said he doesn't expect interest rates to rise in
            the near future. When that happens, it will probably lower
            valuation multiples on companies, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Friedman has worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years
            and was named a partner in 1990. He and Chief Executive Officer
            Lloyd C. Blankfein are the only two executives to sit on the
            firm's management committee since it was created in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's ISS Said to Get Demand for All Shares in IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ISS Holding A/S has demand for all
            the shares being sold in an initial public offering valuing the
            cleaning company at as much as 31.7 billion kroner ($5.8
            billion), according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS, whose owners include Goldman Sachs (GS) Capital Partners
            and EQT Partners AB, sent a message on demand for the sale to
            institutional investors, the people said, asking not to be
            identified while the transaction is on. The company set a price
            range of 140 to 175 kroner a share on March 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS, based in Soeborg, Denmark, said on Feb. 18 it would
            raise 8 billion kroner to repay debt. The IPO, the largest in
            Denmark in 20 years, comes amid a revival in investor interest
            in Europe, where the volume of initial sales approximately
            doubled in 2013, compared with the previous year, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The offering will also include shareholders Goldman Sachs
            and EQT selling some of their stakes. Nordea Bank AB, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG are joint global coordinators, ISS
            said. Lazard is acting as financial adviser to ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ISS shares are worth buying at 155 kroner, equivalent to a
            valuation of 29 billion kroner, Sydbank A/S said in a note to
            clients today. ISS will announce the final share price no later
            than March 17. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Bicudo, Pereira to Head Brazil Investment Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Fabio Bicudo and Antonio Pereira will become co-heads of the Brazil
            investment-banking business after Daniel Wainstein retired from
            the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira are currently co-chief operating
            officers of the business, the New York-based firm said today in
            internal memos. The contents of the memos were confirmed by a
            Goldman Sachs spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had been discussing the changes with
            Wainstein for the past several months, a person at the firm said
            yesterday, asking not to be identified because the decision
            hadn't yet been announced. Wainstein, 42, and Andre Laport Ribeiro are Goldman Sachs's only partners in
            Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein, who asked to leave after working at the firm
            since 2000, was appointed chairman of Brazil investment banking
            in April 2012, when Pereira and Bicudo were named co-COOs. The
            bank ranked sixth in equity underwriting in Brazil last year,
            with $732 million in transactions, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. It was No. 8 among merger advisers with $14.3 billion in
            deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bicudo and Pereira are members of the board of Goldman
            Sachs Bank in Brazil and serve on the company's management
            committee for the country. Bicudo joined Goldman Sachs in 1999
            and stayed until 2006. He came back to the company in 2010.
            Pereira joined the firm in 1996 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Paulo Leme &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, which doesn't disclose Brazil revenue or
            profit, named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country a year ago.
            Goldman Sachs has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on
            complex products with higher profit margins, such as convertible
            debt and receivables securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-
            based companies such as Bradesco BBI SA, Banco Itau BBA SA and
            Banco BTG Pactual SA, which have used their stronger local
            contacts to squeeze out foreign firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-
            service bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy
            local firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de
            Investimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse
            Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,
            an investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold
            back to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.
            BTG went public last year in a $1.94 billion initial offering
            that Goldman Sachs helped underwrite. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>UBS Hires Bank M&amp;amp;A Advisers From Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN) hired bank takeover
            specialists Tannon Krumpelman and Doug Simons as Switzerland's
            biggest lender rebuilds its financial-services practice to cope
            with a prolonged dealmaking slump in that industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Krumpelman joins Zurich-based UBS from Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. and Simons comes to the firm from Credit Suisse Group AG,
            according to Greg Kennedy and Steve Pierson, co-heads of UBS's
            financial-services group for the Americas. Krumpelman and Simons
            are managing directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hires are part of a broader overhaul of UBS's
            investment bank, which exited most of its fixed-income trading
            to boost profits. UBS recruited Kennedy and Pierson, who
            previously worked together at Credit Suisse, to oversee a
            makeover of its financial-services coverage out of New York. In
            the past year, the group has cut more than 20 junior people and
            replaced about half of its dozen senior bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We want to be exactly the right size so all of the
            business we are doing is profitable business,' Kennedy said in
            an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There were $95 billion in announced deals for U.S. banks,
            insurance companies, specialty lenders and other financial
            services companies in 2013, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. That reflects a 6 percent drop from 2012, and is less
            than half of the $217 billion in deals announced in 2007, before
            the credit crisis suffocated financial-services MA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The downturn requires a leaner group staffed with
            rainmakers, Pierson said. The turnaround in UBS's financial
            performance has made recruiting easier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank's profit before tax rose to $2.3
            billion in 2013 from $267 million a year earlier on lower
            expenses and higher income, according to a company investor
            presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Krumpelman spent nine years at Goldman Sachs and started
            its small- to mid-sized bank merger practice, advising Bankia SA
            last year on the $883 million sale of its U.S. susidiary, City
            National Bank of Florida. Simons has more than 20 years of
            experience advising large depositories such as BBT Corp. and
            Wells Fargo Co. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Reversal Mirrors Rupee's Trade Improvement: Currencies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Firms from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            to Deutsche Bank AG are putting their faith in India's rupee as
            the country looks forward to the biggest improvement in its
            broadest measure of trade in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which ranked India as the most vulnerable
            Asian market in September, now predicts the rupee will beat
            peers from Brazil to South Africa and Turkey. Deutsche Bank, the
            largest foreign-exchange trader, and Barclays Plc say it's their
            favorite emerging-market currency. The rupee has risen 6.8
            percent against the dollar over the past six months, the most
            among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are seeking safe, high-yielding assets as the
            U.S. Federal Reserve reduces stimulus and after a slowdown in
            China contributed to the worst start to a year for emerging-market currencies since 2009. For many, India
            fits the bill, as
            policy makers take steps to reverse a slump that sent the rupee
            tumbling to a record last August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'India looks in much better shape now than it did six
            months back,' Kim Jin Ha, a global fixed-income fund manager in
            Seoul at Mirae Asset Management Co., which oversees about $59
            billion, said by e-mail March 3. 'Capital flows can continue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Funds Return &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee's recovery bodes well for India's efforts to curb
            the fastest consumer-price inflation after Argentina among the
            Group of 20 nations, and to boost inflows to help revive the
            slowest economic growth in a decade. Less than three months into
            2014, foreigners have already plowed back more than half of the
            $8 billion they pulled from local bonds last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's rupee climbed as much as 1.1 percent today to
            61.1050 per dollar, the strongest level since Dec. 10, and was
            at 61.1150 as of 10:33 a.m. in New York. It has risen from an
            all-time low of 68.845 on Aug. 28. The rupee weakened 13 percent
            in the second and third quarters of last year amid a decline in
            the country's manufacturing industry and monetary tightening. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee may get a boost after India's current-account
            deficit narrowed to a four-year low as the world's second-largest bullion-consuming nation raised
            gold-import tariffs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade, which
            tracks goods, services and investment income, was $4.2 billion
            last quarter, down from $5.2 billion in the prior three months,
            the Reserve Bank of India said yesterday in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deficit will shrink to $45 billion in the year ending
            March 31, from $88 billion in the prior period, Finance Minister
            Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Small Long' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in February that it saw the rupee at 62
            in three months' time, while its asset-management arm opened
            this year what it called a 'small long' position on the
            currency. HSBC Holdings Plc advises buying the rupee and selling
            Indonesia's rupiah, while Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley
            predict India's currency will strengthen against the Brazilian
            real, according to client notes last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. may buy Indian assets because
            the economy is less exposed to China's faltering growth than
            nations including South Korea, Emmanuel Ng, a strategist at the
            Singapore-based firm, said by e-mail on Feb. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I see the inflows continuing,' said Rajeev De Mello, who
            oversees $10 billion as the head of Asian fixed income at
            Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Big Doubts' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg lifted the median mid-year
            forecast for the rupee to 62.6, from 63.25 three months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While that's a bigger increase than for any of its Asian
            peers, it still signals a drop of more than 1 percent by June
            30. Credit Agricole SA says the rupee will weaken to 70 per
            dollar by mid-year as a clampdown on bullion shipments boosts
            unofficial imports and India prepares for elections next month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'India's external position is not as good as it looks,'
            Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at France's
            third-biggest bank, said in an interview on March 4. 'India's
            imports of gold have actually increased. I have big doubts
            whether the government that will come out of the elections will
            be welcomed by the markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan lifted interest rates three
            times since taking office in September, boosting returns to
            rupee investors and helping slow inflation to 8.8 percent in
            January, from 11.2 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He boosted capital inflows by offering discounted foreign-exchange swaps for dollar deposits and
            debt raised by local
            banks. That helped increase foreign-exchange reserves by $20
            billion, from September's three-year low of $247 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollar-based investors can make a return of 6.5 percent,
            including interest, by holding the rupee until the end of 2014,
            the biggest gain in Asia, according to data based on
            appreciation estimates and deposit rates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Current-account numbers have been the key driver because
            it's a very transparent measure of whether the policy
            prescriptions are having an impact,' Philip Moffitt, the
            Sydney-based head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at Goldman Sachs
            Asset Management, which oversees more than $1 trillion, said in
            an interview. 'If you can find something that's relatively
            cheap and the fundamentals appear to be improving, it's usually
            a good mix.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gold Defying Goldman Sachs With Coffee Percolating: Commodities</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;As the hip-hop duo Outkast once
            opined, 'You can plan a pretty picnic, but you can't predict
            the weather.' Big Boi and Andre 3000 could've been describing
            the commodity markets so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From drought in Brazil to the arctic blast that swept
            across North America, extreme weather drove coffee, sugar and
            natural gas into bull markets just as escalating political
            tension in Ukraine created supply risks for energy and grains.
            The rally for raw materials was a surprise to banks from
            Citigroup Inc. to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that had forecast
            2014 would mark a continuation of last year's slump. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodity funds recorded inflows of $1.57 billion last
            month, the first gain since September, after withdrawals last
            year reached a record $43.3 billion, according to EPFR Global, a
            Cambridge, Massachusetts-based researcher. Investors who shunned
            gold as the metal slumped into a bear market in 2013 increased
            holdings through exchange-traded funds in February for the first
            time since 2012. Dryness in Brazil erased the prospect of a
            record coffee crop as prices jumped, after the longest slide in
            two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a series of mostly unrelated factors that are
            catching commodities at a time when they've already been heavily
            sold,' said Paul Christopher, the St. Louis-based chief
            international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, which manages
            $1.4 trillion. 'A lot of these factors are weather related and
            will fade. I don't think this is a viable opportunity for a
            long-term investor. It's more of a trading opportunity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2014 Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Spot Index (BUSY) of 24 commodities
            climbed 3.3 percent this year, led by a 79 percent surge for
            coffee and gains for hogs, corn and gold. The MSCI All-Country
            World Index of equities rose 0.7 percent, and the Bloomberg
            Dollar Spot Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners,
            slid 0.3 percent. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose
            1.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The GSCI gauge fell 2.2 percent last year, the first
            decline since the global recession in 2008, as a decade of
            higher prices spurred producers to build new mines, drill more
            wells and expand crop planting. Increased supply combined with
            slowing growth in China, the biggest user of everything from
            soybeans to zinc and cotton, prompted New York-based Goldman and
            Citigroup to declare an end to the commodity super cycle that
            caused raw materials to almost quadruple since 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While many investors 'threw in the towel' after last
            year's slump, they shouldn't give up on commodities, said
            Michael Aronstein, who correctly predicted the plunge in raw
            materials in 2008 and the 2009 rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Commodities will just be normal cyclical participants in
            an accelerating expansion globally,' said Aronstein, the
            president and chief investment officer of Marketfield Asset
            Management LLC in New York. 'You're returning to local supply-demand functions in commodities.' Aronstein
            said he started
            buying commodity-related equities at the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will grow 2.9 percent this year,
            accelerating from 1.9 percent in 2013, a Bloomberg survey shows.
            The euro area will expand by 1.1 percent after a contraction of
            0.5 percent last year. Eighteen of the 24 commodities in the
            GSCI index climbed in 2014, and seven of them have posted gains
            of 10 percent or more. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's been a year full of surprises, no doubt about
            that,' said David Rosenberg, the Toronto-based chief economist
            at Gluskin Sheff Associates, which manages about $6.8 billion.
            'There is a time-worn relationship between overall global
            growth and the commodity complex. Between what the U.S. is going
            to do this year and what Europe is going to do, global growth is
            going to be accelerating.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bean Variety &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee, the bean variety favored by Seattle-based
            Starbucks Corp., reached a two-year high this week amid the
            driest summer since 1972 for Brazil, the biggest grower. Crude
            oil jumped to the highest since September, reaching $105.22 a
            barrel in New York on March 3 as tensions escalated between
            Ukraine and Russia, the biggest energy exporter. Unusually
            frigid weather in the U.S. boosted demand for heating fuel,
            while supplies of natural gas and coal will decline to six-year
            lows by the end of this month, government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The supply-and-demand outlook for individual commodities,
            rather than macroeconomics, is now driving prices, said Michael Haigh, the head of commodities research at
            Societe Generale SA
            in New York. Raw materials don't have 'much more downside'
            because prices are near the cost of production, while the
            outlook for slowing growth in China and emerging markets in
            general has already been factored in, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'More Neutral' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup has turned 'more neutral,' though the bank
            still isn't bullish, said Aakash Doshi, a vice president of
            Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in New York. Geopolitical risk and
            weather spurred this year's rally, and increased supplies will
            mean prices probably will decline in the second half of the
            year, especially for grains, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn reserves in the U.S., the biggest grower, will jump 80
            percent before this year's harvest to 1.48 billion bushels after
            farmers collected a record crop in 2013, the government said
            Feb. 10. Global copper production will outpace consumption by
            81,000 metric tons in 2014, after posting a deficit of 175,000
            tons a year earlier, London-based Barclays Plc said in a report
            Feb. 12. The U.S. is extracting the most oil since 1989 as
            producers tap shale-rock formations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, Goldman's preferred
            measure, will drop 4.3 percent in the next 12 months, analysts
            led by Jeffrey Currie said in a report last month. Declines will
            be led by a 14 percent drop for precious metals, while
            agriculture products will fall 9 percent, the bank said in the
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman View &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 2014 rebound is 'more of a transient weather shock as
            opposed to something more persistent,' Currie said in an
            interview March 5. 'It would need to be persistent before we
            would significantly change our view.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold prices, already down about 30 percent from a record in
            2011, will slip toward $1,100 an ounce by the end of the year as
            the U.S. recovery picks up momentum and the dollar gains,
            according to Michael Lewis, the head of commodities research at
            Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG. Futures in New York settled at
            $1,351.80 yesterday. Commodities may 'struggle to attract
            financial flows' as investors buy more equities, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion funds have attracted $522 million since the start
            of the year as investors returned to the precious metal amid the
            escalating turmoil in the Ukraine and slower-than-forecast
            economic growth in the U.S., data from EPFR show. That compares
            with a record outflow of $38.99 billion for 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gold Buyers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The price of gold jumped 11 percent since December,
            rebounding from the 28 percent plunge last year that was the
            biggest decline since 1981. Increasing demand from buyers of
            coins, jewelry and bars will help to sustain bullion's rally
            this year, according to James Steel, chief precious metals
            analyst at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Palladium futures in New York reached a one-year high of
            $785 an ounce yesterday as the U.S. and its allies considered
            sanctions against Russia, the biggest supplier. Output of the
            metal already has been disrupted by labor unrest in South
            Africa, the second-biggest producer. Miners have vowed not to
            back down from a strike that started in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Coldest Start &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coldest start to a year since 2011 means consumers
            won't see the normal seasonal drop in power prices. Natural gas
            is up 29 percent compared with a year ago, adding to costs for
            home heating and power generation. Nationwide, consumers may pay
            an average of 12.28 cents per kilowatt hour from March to May,
            2.5 percent more than a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy
            Information Administration data. Prices will be highest in New
            England. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Frigid weather may also limit meat supplies as low
            temperatures force hogs and cattle to use more energy battling
            the cold, slowing weight gains. A deadly pig virus is
            compounding the outlook for shrinking U.S. pork supplies. Cattle
            and hog futures reached records in Chicago on March 5,
            increasing costs for retailers including Austin, Minnesota-based
            Hormel Foods Corp., the maker of Spam meat spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;World food prices posted the biggest gain in 19 months in
            February on concern that cold weather and drought in the U.S.,
            the biggest exporter of wheat, and dryness in top-sugar producer
            Brazil will harm crops. An index of 55 food items rose 2.6
            percent to 208.1 from 202.9 in January, the United Nations' Food
            Agriculture Organization in Rome said yesterday. The gauge is
            still down 2.1 percent from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Coffee Harvest &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's coffee harvest will reach 47.7 million bags, down
            10 percent from a previous estimate, Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based coffee importer Wolthers Douque, said
            March 5. A bag
            weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coffee prices in New York tumbled 23 percent in 2013, the
            third straight decline and the longest slump since 1993. The
            driest January since 1954 for Brazil erased the outlook for a
            record crop, prompting investors to more than triple their bets
            on a rally last month, government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're in a period of rising unpredictability around
            climate change,' said Stephen Diggle, managing director and co-founder of Singapore-based Vulpes Investment
            Management, which
            manages $250 million. 'We see it as a significant and rising
            threat to food production. The planet is going to experience
            more disruptions in food production in the coming years than it
            has in the past. That means we expect to see more volatility in
            prices.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Restart Mideast Equity Sales on Rally</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            generated one-third of its profit from trading last year, is
            restarting Middle East and North Africa equity sales in Dubai,
            according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets is hiring Veer Ramlugon as part of the plans, one of the
            people said, asking
            not to be identified because the matter isn't public. Ramlugon,
            who declined to comment when contacted by mobile phone earlier
            this week, previously worked in Middle East equity and equity-derivative sales at Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch in Dubai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is joining banks from Renaissance Capital to
            Arqaam Capital Ltd. in expanding coverage in the Middle East and
            Africa as local markets rally and economic growth surges.
            Dubai's benchmark index has advanced the most among 50 of the
            world's largest equity gauges this year with a gain of 23
            percent as the United Arab Emirates' real-estate and banking
            industries recover from a property crash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. was raised to emerging-market status from
            frontier by index provider MSCI Inc. in 2013, potentially paving
            the way for greater foreign investment in the nation. Dubai, the
            Arab world's business hub, is gearing up to host the World Expo
            in 2020 with $8 billion of infrastructure spending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring the sheikhdom's debt against non-payment with credit-default swaps was quoted
            at 189 basis points
            at the end of February, the least since the 187 reached in May,
            according to prices compiled by CMA. They traded at 192 basis
            points as of 3:02 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Renaissance, the Russian investment bank controlled by
            billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, is planning to open an office in
            the city to take advantage of the rising demand for assets in
            the oil-rich region, while Dubai-based Arqaam will start trading
            African bonds and derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Special Situations U.S. Head Dombrowski Departs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Albert Dombrowski, head of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s special situations group in the Americas, has
            left the firm after 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dombrowski wasn't included on a list of partners in a
            regulatory filing today by the New York-based bank. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed
            that Dombrowski
            had departed from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The special situations group trades distressed debt and has
            made investments in companies including pizza chain Sbarro Inc.
            The unit is part of investing and lending, which produced $4.33
            billion of pretax earnings last year, the most profit of any of
            Goldman Sachs's four segments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dombrowski joined the firm in 2002, according to employment
            records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He was
            named a partner in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Julian Salisbury became global head of the special
            situations group in May, replacing Jason Brown. Salisbury, now
            based in New York, previously ran the European portion of the
            unit from London. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Alpha Slumps After Goldman Sell Rating on Coal Oversupply</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR), the
            largest U.S. producer of coal used to make steel, slumped the
            most in seven months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
            rating to sell and lowered price estimates for the commodity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alpha dropped 8.2 percent to $5.03 at 10:23 a.m. in New
            York, after earlier falling as much as 9.9 percent, the most
            intraday since Aug. 2. Other U.S. metallurgical-coal producers
            also declined: Walter Energy Inc. slid as much as 9.2 percent,
            Peabody Energy Corp. was down 4.4 percent and Arch Coal Inc.
            fell 3.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its metallurgical coal price estimate for this
            year to $141 a metric ton from $150 and lowered projections for
            next year and 2016. The move follows increased Australian
            output, an expected slowdown in the growth of Chinese imports,
            and 'limited U.S. supply rationalization,' Neil Mehta and
            Vinit Joshi, analysts at Goldman, said in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect this oversupply level will increase in the
            coming years,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman previously had a hold recommendation on Bristol,
            Virginia-based Alpha. It cut its price target for the stock to
            $4 from $6. Goldman lowered its target price for Birmingham,
            Alabama-based Walter to $10 from $12 while maintaining a hold
            rating. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China Stocks Seen Rallying 24% at Goldman on Valuations</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is
            sticking with its recommendation to buy Chinese stocks, the
            biggest losers worldwide this year, after valuations fell to the
            lowest level in a decade versus global peers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given how share prices have corrected and given where the
            valuations are, from a risk-reward standpoint we still think we
            can make a positive case on Chinese equities,' Kinger Lau, a
            strategist at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview in Hong Kong
            on March 4. He predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)
            will climb to 12,000 in the next 12 months, a 24 percent advance
            from last week's close, versus the brokerage's December forecast
            for the measure to reach 13,600 by the end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The index of Chinese shares in Hong Kong lost 10 percent
            this year through last week, the most among 93 global benchmark
            indexes tracked by Bloomberg, as factory gauges pointed to a
            slowdown in the economy and concern grew that more companies
            will struggle to repay debt after the nation's first onshore
            corporate bond default on March 7. The gauge trades at a 45
            percent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index, the most
            in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's leaders are trying to balance clampdowns on the
            shadow-banking industry and local-government debt with measures
            to support growth in the world's second-largest economy.
            Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science Technology Co. (002506) became the
            first company to default in China after failing to pay full
            interest due last week on onshore bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Relative Value &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China index is valued at 1.1 times net
            assets, the biggest discount since September 2003 to MSCI's
            global index, which has a multiple of 2. The H-share measure
            slid 1.7 percent to 9,540.10 as of 1:41 p.m. in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. today named Helen Zhu as head of China
            equities, luring the New York bank's chief China equity
            strategist away from Goldman Sachs. The appointment takes effect
            on April 7 and Zhu may start managing funds later this year,
            BlackRock said in a statement. The New York-based firm is the
            world's largest money manager, overseeing about $4.3 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China
            Construction Bank Corp. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. all
            trade at about the same level as their net assets, while Bank of
            China Ltd. has a price-to-book ratio of 0.8. The four lenders
            are the nation's biggest by market value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Any clear and concrete policy measures in terms of
            dealing with shadow banking loans and local government debt
            would likely be positive catalysts for banks,' Lau said.
            'Valuations for Chinese banks have already priced in a very
            significant crisis scenario.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Regulated Borrowing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premier Li Keqiang told the National People's Congress last
            week that China will develop a regulated regional borrowing
            mechanism, after local-government liabilities surged to 17.9
            trillion yuan ($2.9 trillion) as of June 2013 from 10.7 trillion
            yuan at the end of 2010. Authorities have also started a cleanup
            of the $6 trillion shadow-banking industry and identified
            sectors of the economy in need of consolidation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Chinese banks' non-performing loans rose by 28.5
            billion yuan in the last quarter of 2013 to 592.1 billion yuan,
            the highest since September 2008, bad loans only accounted for 1
            percent of total lending, the China Banking Regulatory
            Commission said Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank valuations currently imply a non-performing loan ratio
            of about 7 percent, Lau said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An improving global economic outlook may also be a catalyst
            for a rally in Chinese shares, Lau said, declining to name
            specific stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The World Bank raised its 2014 growth forecasts for
            advanced nations in January to 2.2 percent from 2 percent, while
            cutting its estimates for developing nations to 5.3 percent from
            5.6 percent. China is the world's biggest exporter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China last week retained a target for 7.5 percent growth in
            2014 for the $9 trillion economy. Gross domestic product
            expanded 7.7 percent in 2013, the same pace as in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A purchasing managers' index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
            Markit Economics dropped to a seven-month low of 48.5, the
            companies said March 3. A similar gauge from the government with
            a larger sample size fell to 50.2, the lowest since June, a
            report showed March 1. Numbers above 50 signal expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Overseas shipments unexpectedly declined 18.1 percent in
            February from a year earlier, customs data showed March 8,
            compared with analysts' median estimate for a 7.5 percent
            increase. Producer prices fell 2 percent, the most since July,
            according to a statistics bureau report yesterday, extending the
            longest decline since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Share Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China gauge has tumbled 16 percent since Noah Weisberger, a New York-based analyst at
            Goldman Sachs, predicted
            on Dec. 2 that the H-share measure would rally 18 percent by the
            end of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's forecast formed part of a trade
            recommendation in which the bank told investors to buy Chinese
            stocks while selling copper as a bet that commodities would lag
            the rally in equities. Goldman Sachs called the trade its fourth
            top recommendation for 2014. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Seeks Sydney Beachhead as Aussie Depreciates: Currencies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's dollar has tumbled 15
            percent from its high last year and strategists forecast more
            pain ahead. For Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it's the perfect time
            to develop Sydney as a hub for trading local-currency assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's stable AAA credit rating makes it a haven and
            encourages sovereign-wealth funds to allocate more money there,
            said Simon Rothery, the chief executive officer of Goldman
            Sachs's operations in the country and neighboring New Zealand.
            The New York-based firm moved its Australian credit derivatives
            business from Hong Kong to Sydney last month after bringing over
            bond and swaps trading last year, Rothery said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Aussie dollar is an ever more important part of
            sovereign-wealth funds, central banks and global accounts,'
            Rothery said in a Feb. 27 interview in Sydney. 'Everybody wants
            to play the China story, but you can't get exposure directly so
            people gain access through Australia.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a sign of Australia's rising prominence, the
            International Monetary Fund began breaking out central banks'
            holdings of the local dollar at the end of 2012. Before that, it
            was lumped together in the organization's 'other currencies'
            category. Offshore investors boosted their holdings of the
            country's government bonds -- the highest-yielding top-rated
            sovereign securities -- by A$28 billion ($25 billion) in 2013,
            to a record A$217.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;MUBI, an online-movie service catering to independent and art-house film enthusiasts, said it's
            closing a $7.5 million fundraising this week after hooking up with Samsung (005930) Electronics Co. to offer
            its service worldwide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joe Osnoss and Simon Patterson, co-heads of Silver Lake
            Management LLC's Europe investment business, film producer Eric Fellner, and Pascal Cagni, who oversaw Apple
            Inc.'s Europe, Middle East, India and Africa operations as vice president until 2012, are among MUBI's
            investors, Chief Executive Officer Efe Cakarel said in a London interview. Samsung, the world's biggest
            maker of smartphones and televisions, agreed to offer the service on its smart televisions and BluRay
            devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are seeing massive growth in the U.K. and Germany, and
            increasingly Turkey,' said Cakarel, who worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. from 1998 to 2002. 'We're in both
            developing and developed markets, but we're most excited about emerging markets that have strong potential
            for growth.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MUBI, based in Palo Alto and London, predicts revenue will climb to about
            $100 million in three years from its web-based subscription service, tapping demand for online-film
            entertainment. Netflix Inc., the world's largest subscription streaming service, reported profit jumped more
            than fivefold to $48.4 million in the fourth quarter as its domestic video customers rose. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman's Tourre Ordered to Pay $825,000 in SEC Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president Fabrice Tourre, found liable for his part in a
            failed $1 billion investment, was ordered to pay more than $825,000 in the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan ruled today that
            Tourre must pay $650,000 in civil penalties and give up $175,463 of his 2007 bonus, plus interest. He can't
            seek reimbursement of the penalties from Goldman Sachs, the judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tourre, 35, was
            found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at which the SEC claimed he intentionally misled investors in a
            subprime-mortgage vehicle called Abacus 2007-AC1. Tourre lied about the role played by billionaire John
            Paulson's Paulson Co. hedge fund, which helped choose the securities underlying Abacus then made a
            billion-dollar bet it would fail, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was one of the
            government's most prominent efforts to fix responsibility for the housing market crash, which helped
            precipitate the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. Critics have faulted the SEC for not doing more to
            police the abuses that helped lead to the crisis or to pursue top financial executives they say are
            responsible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The SEC's allegations against Tourre and Goldman Sachs helped spur Congress
            in 2010 to enact the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, aimed at averting future
            crises. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sees Bitcoin Future in Payments Over Money</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. analysts
            see Bitcoin as an innovative payments technology while doubting
            that it will evolve into a true alternative currency, according
            to a research report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the report, titled 'All About Bitcoin,' the
            researchers write that they examined multiple views of the
            digital currency by people inside and outside of Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'So where does that leave us? With the conclusion that
            Bitcoin likely can't work as a currency, but some sense that the
            ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise,'
            the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin emerged from source code written by an anonymous
            developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto
            in 2009, and attracted a following motivated in part by the
            ability to escape the strictures of traditional currency,
            notably government control. The report by Goldman Sachs lends
            credibility to the virtual currency, said Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, a group of angel
            investors in early stage
            Bitcoin startups. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The tone overall is conservative and measured,' Terpin
            said of the report. 'People will read it and draw their own
            conclusions. It's nice they are paying attention to it, and
            don't have a Bitcoin-is-evil view.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Biggest Hurdle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua, the researchers at Goldman
            Sachs who wrote the report, said that the ability to pay for
            goods and services using Bitcoin is growing, saying that
            'obstacles to Bitcoin being used more broadly in the payments
            system are arguably not insurmountable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering
            information-technology services, said Bitcoin's 'biggest
            hurdle' will be maintaining its cost advantage in the face of

            &lt;p&gt;'While it is too early to tell how banks and payment
            processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Vestar Said to Near Purchase of Hearthside Food</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wind Point Partners LP is near an
            agreement to sell snack maker Hearthside Food Solutions LLC to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private-equity arm and Vestar Capital
            Partners Inc. for about $1.1 billion, people with knowledge of
            the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal may be announced as soon as tomorrow, said the
            people, asking not to be identified discussing private
            information. BC Partners Holdings Ltd. and Oak Hill Capital
            Partners LP also made offers for the business, people said
            earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hearthside, which makes snacks including pretzels and
            cookies sold under consumer-product companies' brand names, was
            acquired by Wind Point in 2009. The company sold its ready-to-eat cereals and granola-making business to
            Post Holdings Inc.
            last year, according to its website. Barclays Plc started an
            auction for Downers Grove, Illinois-based Hearthside late last
            year, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a New York-based spokeswoman for Goldman
            Sachs declined to comment on its interest in Hearthside as did
            Carol Makovich, a spokeswoman for Vestar. Marc Hazelton a
            spokesman for Barclays also declined to comment, while officials
            at Wind Point couldn't immediately be reached. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vestar was part of a group of buyout funds that acquired
            Del Monte Foods Co. in a $5.3 billion deal in 2011. Vestar also
            acquired a stake in grocery wholesaler American Roland Foods
            Corp. in August and has owned consumer brands including Birds
            Eye Foods and Celstial Seasonings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chicago-based Wind Point, which manages about $2.8 billion
            of assets, also owns snack food maker Shearer's Foods LLC and
            meat product maker Rupari Food Services Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google Unmasks Patent Accuser in Tangled Goldman Link</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. wanted to find out who was behind a company called Suffolk Technologies LLC that
            accused the world's largest search engine's owner of using its Internet-search technology without
            permission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turns out, the tangled ownership history included big names: Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. and BT Group Plc's British Telecom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tired of fighting sometimes frivolous
            patent-infringement suits that cost millions of dollars in legal fees, companies such as Google and Apple
            Inc. are using ownership questions to help their court cases. Unveiling litigants can get a suit dismissed,
            disclose the real entity behind a case or identify a target for revenge. Even before Suffolk lost its case,
            Google retaliated last year by filing a patent-infringement suit against British Telecom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You
            would think that determining who owns a patent is a pretty straightforward process,' said Stephen Korniczky,
            co-chairman of the intellectual property practice of Sheppard Mullin in Del Mar, California. 'If a patent is
            assigned to a company, then it's recorded with the patent office. The problem really lies in who owns the
            company or entity to whom the patents have been assigned.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google, Cisco Systems Inc.
            and other technology companies have persuaded Congress to consider legislation requiring patent owners to
            disclose the 'real party in interest.' The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is considering rules to make
            public the 'attributable ownership' of a patent. It will hold hearings on the proposal today in Alexandria,
            Virginia, and March 26 in San Francisco. The challenge may be figuring out what those terms mean and what
            information must be disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Send Refunds After Dark Pool Error</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) discovered
            pricing errors in the firm's dark pool trading venue and sent
            checks to customers to compensate for the mistakes, according to
            people with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank sent the money to clients and other Wall Street
            firms that use its Sigma X pool for equity trades made in August
            2011, said the people, who requested anonymity because the
            communications and payments aren't public. Concerns that Greece
            would default on its debt that month led to a sharp decline in
            stock markets and dramatic price swings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the refunds probably weren't large relative to
            Goldman Sachs's trading revenue, the errors show the potential
            risks to operators of dark pools, which were created to let
            major investors trade big blocks of stock without having news of
            the orders move prices. Sigma X is one of the largest dark pools
            in the U.S., accounting for 1 percent of total daily trading in
            January, data from Rosenblatt Securities Inc. show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The refunds were sent to customers whose trades were
            executed at a certain point beyond the national best bid and
            offer, according to one of the recipients. Stock venues in the
            U.S. are obliged to price trades at the NBBO or better. Goldman
            Sachs appears to have taken the action voluntarily. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sees Quality Flight as Costs Jump Most in 6 Months</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says
            investors should favor debt from better quality companies, after
            yield premiums jumped the most in almost six months last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The headlines from China and emerging markets have caused
            volatility in the Asia credit market,' analysts led by Hong
            Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a March 15 note. 'We think
            investors should look at stronger quality corporates.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost to borrow in dollars for companies in Asia outside
            Japan climbed 11.1 basis points last week, the most since the
            period ended Sept. 27, according to JPMorgan Chase Co.
            indexes. Bond risk in the region advanced, with a gauge of 40
            investment-grade issuers gaining 8.5 basis points, the most in
            seven weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Emerging-market investors from Europe have mixed views on
            Asia, according to Goldman Sachs. Defaults in China, where
            Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science Technology Co. failed to
            fully pay a debt coupon earlier this month, are contributing to
            caution, the analysts wrote. China bond funds extended their
            longest streak of outflows since early in the third quarter of
            2013 in the week to March 12, EPFR Global said in an e-mailed
            report dated March 14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Risk appetite weakened amid slowing Chinese industrial
            output and emerging-market uncertainty, Goldman Sachs said.
            Factory production rose 8.6 percent in January and February from
            a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said last
            week, the weakest start to a year since 2009. Voters in Crimea
            chose to become part of Russia in a referendum deemed illegal by
            the European Union and the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;India, Indonesia &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Although China high yield, especially the real estate
            sector, has underperformed this year, we think it's too early to
            turn positive as we expect more credit differentiation and more
            headline news on defaults to come,' Ho said in the note. 'We
            also maintain our preference for better quality corporates and
            banks in India and Indonesia.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Asia index climbed 1.5 basis points to
            135.5 basis points as of 8:54 a.m. in Singapore, Standard
            Chartered Plc prices show. The measure is set for its highest
            close since March 3, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Australia gauge rose 1 basis point to
            107.5 as of 11:00 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
            Australia Bank Ltd. The benchmark is on course to match its
            highest close since Feb. 4, according to CMA, which is owned by
            McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
            privately negotiated market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 81
            basis points as of 9:00 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
            bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
            credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
            creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
            the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
            agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Chinese Commodity Financing May Unwind in 24 Months</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Financing arrangments in China
            using commodities from copper to rubber as collateral to obtain
            credit may be unwound in 12 to 24 months, driven by increased
            yuan volatility, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As much as 1 million metric tons of copper and 30 million
            tons of iron ore could be released if the deals unwind, the bank
            said in a report today. The unwinding would be bearish 'given
            relatively limited physical liquidity to absorb the shock,'
            analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote. For now, the deals remain
            profitable and an 'abrupt government crackdown' on them is
            unlikely given the potential effect on the country's economic
            growth, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our view is that Chinese commodity financing deals will
            gradually unwind over the medium term, driven by an increase in
            foreign exchange hedging costs, which would slowly erode
            financing deal profitability and eventually close the interest
            rate arbitrage,' the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transactions using commodities as collateral made as
            much as $160 billion, or 31 percent of China's total short-term
            foreign-exchange loans, the report showed. Gold, copper and iron
            ore are most commonly used as collateral, followed by soybeans,
            palm oil, rubber, nickel, zinc and aluminum, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Hot Money' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe Chinese commodity financing deals are ongoing
            and facilitating 'hot money' inflows into China by providing a
            mechanism to import low-cost foreign financing,' the analysts
            wrote. The deals 'create excess physical demand and tighten the
            physical markets artificially; in contrast, an unwind creates
            excess supply and thus is bearish to prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the exception of iron ore, profitability of most
            hedged arrangements remains 'substantial' because of positive
            yuan- and dollar-based interest-rate differentials, limited
            depreciation of the yuan last month and abundant commodity
            supply, which limits hedging costs, the bank said. Continued
            weakening of the yuan may spur some of the deals to unwind
            sooner than expected, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's yuan had the biggest three-day decline since at
            least 2007 on concern rising financial risks will weaken growth
            in the world's second-largest economy. The yuan has dropped 2.4
            percent from a 20-year high of 6.0406 per dollar reached on Jan.
            14, after strengthening 2.9 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1 Million Tons &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Returns from using copper as collateral are still more than
            10 percent and up to 1 million tons of the metal may be tied to
            such arrangements, Goldman Sachs said. That's up from 500,000
            tons nine months ago, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Imports of copper and iron ore into China rose to records
            in January on financing demand, before sliding in February as
            the currency weakened and the state moved to rein in shadow
            banking. About 40 percent of iron-ore stockpiles at Chinese
            ports are linked to finance deals, Mysteel Research estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Financing arrangements probably lie behind a surge in
            Chinese gold imports from Hong Kong, Goldman Sachs said. The
            deals involve physical imports of gold and exports of semi-fabricated products to bring foreign exchange
            into China,
            according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of commodities used for financing increased
            since mid-2013 as the government cut the amount of money that
            could be borrowed per commodity unit, Goldman Sachs said. Copper
            financing may account for about $23 billion worth of short-term
            foreign exchange loans, iron ore for $10.4 billion and soybeans
            for $7.7 billion in a base case, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;

            won't increase rates in the coming months, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint's slump was caused by a reduction in Federal
            Reserve stimulus and the crisis in Ukraine and is beyond the
            government's control, Hungary's Economy Minister Mihaly Varga
            said in an interview with Gazdasagi Radio on March 18. Hungarian
            bonds yield an average 286 basis points above U.S. Treasuries,
            compared with an emerging-market average of 315, according to
            JPMorgan Chase Co. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Recent statements by Hungarian officials argue that there
            still may be some way to go before tolerance to currency
            depreciation runs out,' the analysts wrote. 'Dovish surprises
            are likely to maintain the tightening pressure on local currency
            premia and bring EUR/HUF to 320.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Derivatives trading shows there is a 38 percent chance the
            forint will weaken past 320 per euro in the next year, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. The probability it will
            strengthen to 300 is 30 percent. The forint decline this year is
            the fourth-worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies
            tracked by Bloomberg, following the Argentine peso, the Russian
            ruble and Chile's peso. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fed, Ukraine &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A gauge of 20 emerging-market currencies has fallen 1.5
            percent in 2014. The Fed voted on March 19 to reduce its bond-purchase program to $55 billion a month.
            Russian President
            Vladimir Putin signed legislation today to complete the process
            of Crimea's accession to Russia. The move is against the wishes
            of Ukraine, last month ousted pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor
            Yanukovych. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magyar Nemzeti Bank cut its benchmark rate to a record 2.7
            percent last month in 19 consecutive steps. The Monetary Policy
            Council will probably cut the rate by 10 basis points next week,
            in line with Goldman's estimate, according to the median of 22
            estimates in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint is vulnerable because the extra yield on
            Hungary's local-currency bonds over hard currency-denominated
            assets offer little or no reward, the Goldman analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Local Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on securities included in the Bloomberg Hungary
            Local Sovereign Bond Index are 54 basis points below the
            constituents of an index of Hungary's dollar-denominated bonds.
            That compares with a premium of as much as 200 basis points on
            forint-denominated bonds before the monetary easing started in
            2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Economic policy will have to adapt to a weak forint after
            Hungary's April 6 parliamentary election, said Varga, whose
            Fidesz party is poised to win the vote according to all opinion
            polls. The next administration should strengthen export-oriented
            industries to exploit the currency's weakness, rather than
            trying to influence the exchange rate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Backs Up IEX Endorsement With Biggest Market Share</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the biggest broker on the upstart U.S. stock platform created by
            IEX Group Inc., according to a memo IEX sent some clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said last week
            that markets would be well-served if the five-month-old venue achieved 'critical mass.' The dark pool, which
            has ambitions to become an exchange, was built with defenses against the fastest traders. Yesterday, in a
            memo obtained by Bloomberg News, IEX said Goldman Sachs has more than double the volume of the No. 2 broker.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a bit surprising to see a major broker be such an active and vocal supporter of
            IEX early on,' Justin Schack, partner and managing director for market structure analysis at Rosenblatt
            Securities Inc., said in a phone interview. 'It's an important vote of confidence in IEX.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gerald
            Lam, a spokesman for New York-based IEX, declined to comment on the memo or the endorsement from Goldman
            Sachs. Tiffany Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the New York-based firm has no comment beyond last
            week's memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has played kingmaker before in the exchange industry. It was
            an early investor in IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. and was among the firm's largest shareholders when
            it went public in 2005. Atlanta-based ICE, which now owns the New York Stock Exchange, has grown to become
            the world's second-biggest bourse owner by market value at $23 billion. Goldman Sachs was also a shareholder
            of Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which merged this year with Bats Global Markets Inc. to form an exchange
            operator with about 20 percent of American volume. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman M&amp;amp;A Head Cites Faith in Acquirers as 2014 Deal Catalyst</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors' confidence in companies
            making acquisitions is emboldening management to execute deals,
            spurring a mergers and acquisitions boom, according to Michael Carr, co-head of Americas MA at Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shareholders have been embracing the acquiring companies,
            Carr said today at the 26th annual Tulane University Corporate
            Law Institute in New Orleans, signaling faith in the lasting
            value of transactions as well as challenging the conventional
            wisdom that they should brace for a selloff. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Public U.S. companies worth more than $1 billion have risen
            an average of 5.2 percent in 2014 the day after announcing they
            are acquiring a target, a reversal from the 1.9 percent one-day
            decline buyers experienced five years ago, according to data
            from Goldman Sachs. Almost 75 percent of acquiring companies
            have gone up following deal announcements in the fourth quarter
            of 2013 and the first quarter this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is all about shareholder sentiment,' Carr said.
            'Shareholders are accepting the companies' view of synergies
            and cost savings, and they're giving a lot more credit than they
            did.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There have been more than 6,500 deals announced globally in
            the year to date, valued at almost $650 billion, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. That's the most volume in the first
            three months of the year since the first quarter of 2007, when
            volume reached $960 billion, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first-quarter volume reflects a 28 percent jump from
            the year-earlier quarter, and a 12 percent increase from the
            fourth quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Strategic Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More companies are shifting toward strategic MA in 2014
            and away from financial engineering, such as share buybacks,
            Carr said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp.'s $45.2 billion agreement to buy Time Warner
            Cable Inc. was the largest announced in the first three months
            of the year, topping a failed hostile bid from Charter
            Communications Inc. Actavis Plc's $21 billion offer for
            drugmaker Forest Laboratories Inc. and Facebook Inc.'s $19
            billion takeover of mobile messaging service WhatsApp Inc.
            followed the cable combination to round out the quarter's top
            three acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's deals have been motivated by 'expansion of
            market presence and consolidation,' rather than many of 2013's
            biggest takeovers, which were 'clean-up trades,' Carr said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp.'s buyout of the remainder of NBCUniversal
            from General Electric Co., and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)'s
            acquisition of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group Plc were two
            2013 deals driven by financial concerns and cheap debt, rather
            than 'building influence in their particular industries,' Carr
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The character of the market feels different than a good
            part of 2013.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Sentiment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Standard Poor's 500 Index has gained more than
            65 percent since September 2011, earnings growth has risen just
            14 percent in the same time period, indicating the market is
            expecting profits to rise from deals, he said. This supports
            deal advisers, who must count on shareholder sentiment to propel
            future acquisitions, Carr said. It's 'very, very hard for MA
            activity to pick up' without that optimism, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Comcast's Time Warner Cable acquisition, the largest U.S.
            cable deal since Comcast's $72 billion merger with ATT
            Broadband in 2001, helped propel Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
            Chase Co. to the top rankings for fees for the quarter, data
            compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner Cable and JPMorgan
            advised Comcast, according to the press release announcing that
            deal. Bankers earned about $143 million on that merger, the
            third-largest payday for any deal since 2009, according to New
            York-based research firm Freeman Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley has advised on 58 deals this year, valued at
            more than $215 billion, followed by JPMorgan's $162 billion for
            59, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs landed in third place for advising on
            $132 billion of deals, it worked on more transactions than
            either bank, at 77. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc rounded out
            the top five. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs President Says Markets 'Ignoring' Risks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
            Gary Cohn said prices in global markets don't reflect the risks
            from geopolitical conflicts such as Russia's annexation of
            Crimea. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For the last six to 12 months, markets for some reason
            have been ignoring a lot of the geopolitical risk,' Cohn, 53,
            said in an interview with Canadian television network CBC.
            'Russia, Crimea, Ukraine: this is not the first or newest
            geopolitical risk we've had in the last year or so.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn cited tensions between China and Japan as well as
            continuing violence in the Middle East as risks that haven't
            halted a climb in global equities over the last 12 months.
            Investors with a lot of cash have felt pressure to deploy it,
            preventing a sustained downturn in prices, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anytime we get any sell-off in the market, there's new
            investors coming into the market, so we haven't seen that
            repricing,' Cohn said. Investors are saying, 'I've got to put
            cash to work, and maybe these situations are going to be with us
            for a long time, and I can't sit on cash at the bank earning no
            return forever,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, Cohn said the U.S. stock market seems fairly valued,
            given low interest rates and bond yields that will probably
            climb. The Standard Poor's 500 Index has risen 18 percent in
            the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In a lot of respects, owning equities in the world today
            seems like the least risky opportunity for cash out there,'
            Cohn said. 'Each of the alternatives has its own negative
            potential consequences to it, and then you evaluate all the
            alternatives in relationship to each other, and then you end up
            in a scenario where I think equities provide the most upside
            versus the downside.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Quadrangle Said to Prepare Sale of Norway's GET</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Get AS, Norway's second-largest cable operator, is being put up for sale by its private-equity
            owners and may fetch as much as 7.7 billion kroner ($1.3 billion), according to two people familiar with the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s buyout unit, GS Capital Partners, and Quadrangle
            Capital Partners, which bought Get AS in 2007 for 5.8 billion kroner, are sounding out buyers about a sale
            process or potential initial public offering expected to start this year, said the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the deliberations are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get AS, which competes with
            larger Telenor ASA (TEL)'s Canal Digital unit, is the latest cable company to join a flurry of mergers and
            acquisitions as demand for bundled broadband, pay-TV and wireless services increases. Vodafone Group Plc
            (VOD) this month agreed to buy Spain's Grupo Corporativo Ono SA for 7.2 billion euros ($10 billion)
            including debt. Cable tycoon Patrick Drahi's Numericable SA (NUM) is competing with Bouygues SA (EN) to
            combine with Vivendi SA's French mobile-phone unit SFR. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A London-based spokeswoman for
            Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while representatives for Quadrangle and Oslo-based Get didn't respond to
            e-mails requests seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Quadrangle haven't made a final
            decision on the sale and could decide to retain the business, one of the people said. Get, which offers TV
            and broadband-Internet access, has about 1 million customers in Norway, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension plans and insurance companies. They usually
            charge a management fee of as much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from investments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>RBC Joins Goldman Sachs in Supporting New Stock Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Canada (RY) joined Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. in voicing support for IEX Group Inc.'s five-month-old U.S. stock market, which was
            designed to mitigate the
            influence of computerized high-speed traders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's RBC Capital Markets unit executed the first
            trade on IEX in October, according to an internal memo from
            RBC's head of global equities, Greg Mills, and the U.S. equities
            chief, Bobby Grubert. Royal Bank also supported the market's
            development while its founders were still employed at the bank,
            according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Bank has positioned itself as a champion of making
            the stock market more fair. It built a software defense known as
            THOR that tries to protect clients' orders from the fastest
            traders. Also, the Toronto-based bank doesn't run a dark pool,
            shunning a common practice among the world's biggest brokerages.
            On broker-owned dark pools, customers' orders are executed
            privately instead of being sent to public exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have always been strongly opposed to predatory trading
            strategies,' according to the memo. 'RBC and IEX are fully
            aligned and have a shared philosophy of creating a fair and open
            market structure for investors and all industry participants.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kait Conetta, a Royal Bank spokeswoman, confirmed the
            document is authentic and declined to comment further. The
            company is Canada's second-largest lender by assets. Neither
            Royal Bank nor any other broker owns a stake in IEX. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Attorney General &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The endorsements of IEX come amid heightened scrutiny of
            the structure and vulnerabilities of the U.S. stock market,
            where more than 50 electronic venues compete to match buyers
            with sellers. 'Flash Boys' by author Michael Lewis, scheduled
            for release next week, in part tells the story of IEX Chief
            Executive Officer Brad Katsuyama, according to excerpts from the
            book. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said last week
            that he's investigating whether exchanges and other venues are
            giving high-speed traders improper advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So far, IEX has captured only a small slice of stock
            trading. Average daily volume increased to 14.7 million shares
            in February from 9.1 million in January, and is about 18 million
            in March, according to IEX. That's less than 1 percent of the
            2014 daily average of 6.9 billion on all U.S. markets, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IEX attempts to declaw high-speed traders by delaying
            reports of order executions by 350 millionths of a second,
            enough to curb the fastest firms. IEX also shuns the use of the
            maker-taker business model, in which exchanges and other venues
            pay rebates to market makers for providing bids and offers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Bank has urged regulators to consider alternatives to
            that system, saying it creates a conflict of interest for
            brokers who may pick a venue because of its rebates rather than
            the best interests of clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Normally Private &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a challenge to other dark pools, IEX last year released
            its normally private regulatory filing that explains how it
            operates. While currently organized as a dark pool, IEX has
            ambitions to officially become an exchange, Katsuyama said
            during an interview with Bloomberg News last year. There are 13
            stock exchanges in the U.S., including the New York Stock
            Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in its memo last week that 'it would be
            best for the overall market if IEX achieved critical mass, even
            if that results in reduced volumes' on Sigma X, the Goldman
            Sachs dark pool. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The founders of IEX worked on their business plan for
            months while still at RBC, according to the RBC memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While it was hard to part with such strong talent, it was
            the right thing to do for our clients,' the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are at the forefront of significant market structure
            reform,' Royal Bank said. 'While we may see other industry
            participants potentially amending their practices based on
            recent developments, our approach as the client advocate has
            been consistent from day one and we will continue to stand by
            this philosophy in the months and years to come.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Must Face Lawsuit Over 2007 Mortgage Bonds</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
            persuade a federal judge to again throw out a securities lawsuit
            over residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2007
            after an appeals court overturned an earlier decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in Manhattan,
            who had dismissed the lawsuit by the Police and Fire Retirement
            System of the City of Detroit twice before, ruled yesterday that
            a 2012 appellate decision overturning her findings in a related
            lawsuit had 'significantly changed the landscape.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed
            Cedarbaum's ruling that the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund,
            which had sued Goldman Sachs in 2008, had failed to claim a
            sufficient loss from the investments. The appeals panel also
            threw out her ruling that the fund couldn't represent investors
            in offerings of the securities it hadn't bought itself. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yesterday's ruling follows a New York state appeals court
            decision in January that Goldman Sachs must face fraud claims in
            a $1 billion lawsuit filed by an Australian hedge fund, Basis
            Capital Funds Management Ltd.'s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, over
            collateralized debt obligations sold by the bank before the
            financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, Goldman Sachs reached a $550
            million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission to resolve claims over the marketing of CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Judge Reversed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the federal case, the Detroit pension fund filed a
            separate lawsuit in 2010 on behalf of investors that bought
            securities from the trust for which Cedarbaum had said NECA
            couldn't bring claims. The judge had dismissed the Detroit
            fund's lawsuit twice largely on her determination that it didn't
            adequately allege how Goldman Sachs's purported
            misrepresentations caused any loss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After the higher court's ruling, 'the fact that PFRS
            received payments throughout the life of the certificates, and
            was arguably aware of the risk that there would not be a
            secondary market for its certificates, is immaterial,'
            Cedarbaum said in yesterday's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is The Police and Fire Retirement System of the
            City of Detroit v. Goldman, Sachs Co., 10-04429, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Saidenberg Moving to Commodities Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            earned a third of its profit from trading last year, moved Guy Saidenberg from head of global
            foreign-exchange trading to allow
            JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s Kayhan Mirza to assume the job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saidenberg, who was named to the currencies post last year,
            becomes global co-head of commodities trading with Greg Agran in
            June, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a March 28 internal
            memo. That's when Mirza joins as a partner and London-based
            chief of the unit that Saidenberg ran, the bank said in a
            separate memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, confirmed
            the appointments and declined further comment, as did JPMorgan's
            Brian Marchiony. Saidenberg declined to comment through an
            associate in his office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currency-trading revenue at the 10 largest global
            investment banks declined 9 percent in 2013, according to
            industry analytics firm Coalition Ltd. Goldman Sachs Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in October that the
            firm's currency business had 'difficulty managing inventory'
            in the third quarter as the company posted its worst fixed-income trading revenue since the financial
            crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saidenberg joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 on the interest-rate products trading desk and was named a
            managing director in
            2005 and partner the following year, according to the memo. He
            will also continue as head of Europe, Middle East and Africa
            emerging markets trading, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported Goldman Sachs's hiring of Mirza,
            who oversaw JPMorgan's EMEA foreign-exchange trading and was
            global head of FX options trading, on March 5. The Wall Street
            Journal reported Saidenberg's new role earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Vipshop Rallies as Goldman Sachs Says Buy Amid Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) rallied to a
            one-week high after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying
            the online fashion retailer, citing its significant growth
            potential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American depositary shares of Vipshop climbed 8.2 percent
            to $149.30 in New York, extending the company's surge this year
            to 78 percent. Vipshop has climbed 23-fold since its U.S. debut
            in March 2012. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. advanced
            0.4 percent to 99.12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The retailer's share of the Chinese apparel market is
            expected to grow to 1.5 percent in 2016 from 1 percent this
            year, translating into revenue of $6 billion in 2016, Goldman
            Sachs analysts led by Weibo Hu wrote in a note dated yesterday.
            Vipshop on March 3 forecast first-quarter sales will double to
            as much as $650 million, above an average analyst estimate of
            $544 million at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vipshop's 'growing credibility as a leader in discount
            retail in China will allow it to introduce more global brands,
            thereby attracting more customers, creating a virtuous cycle,'
            the analysts said. 'We expect the company to seek expansion
            into further product categories, such as maternal and baby
            products.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Salisbury Head of Special-Situations Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Julian Salisbury will become head of the global
            special-situations
            group, a unit that invests the firm's own money and generated as
            much as $4 billion a year before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salisbury, 41, is replacing Jason Brown, who is retiring,
            New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in an internal memo.
            Salisbury will move to New York from London, where he has been
            head of the European special-situations group. Michael DuVally,
            a spokesman for the company, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Special Situations Group, known as SSG, trades
            distressed debt and has made investments in companies from
            Japan's largest golf-course operator to pizza-chain Sbarro Inc.
            In 2011, New York-based Goldman Sachs stopped including SSG's
            results within fixed-income trading, and moved it into a new
            reporting segment called investing and lending that includes
            other proprietary investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's investing and lending division generated $5.89
            billion in 2012, almost triple that of a year earlier. The unit
            gained $1.85 billion from debt securities and loans, and $2.39
            billion from equity securities. The company doesn't break out
            SSG's results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salisbury, a U.K. citizen, was a founding member of the
            European SSG unit in 2003 and was named a partner at the firm in
            2008, according to the memo, which was sent by Pablo J. Salame
            and Isabelle Ealet, co-heads of the securities division. Brown,
            who joined Goldman Sachs from Bear Stearns Cos. in 1999 and
            became a partner in 2006, had led the group from Hong Kong since
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Diversified Portfolio &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Jason's leadership has been instrumental in the design
            and execution of a realigned investment approach in GSSG,
            resulting in a diversified portfolio that has shown strong
            performance in both favorable and challenging market
            conditions,' Ealet and Salame wrote in a separate memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the management changes earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SSG produced $4.1 billion in 2007, 9 percent of the
            company's total revenue. It generated $3.79 billion in 2006,
            according to documents released by a Senate subcommittee in
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has faced questions about whether SSG's
            activities would be crimped by the Volcker rule, which was part
            of the Dodd-Frank Act. Rules about how it will be implemented
            are still being written. The bank has argued that most of the
            unit is a lending business. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Completes Sale of Majority of Reinsurance Business</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold a
            majority stake in its reinsurance business to institutions and
            high-net worth clients as financial firms adjust to demands by
            regulators for more capital. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is keeping a minority stake in the business,
            named Global Atlantic Financial Group, the New York-based bank
            said today in a statement. The firm didn't disclose the price of
            the private offering or what percentage it retained. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz said in January
            that the bank was considering selling a stake in the business
            because international regulators are imposing higher capital
            requirements. The bank at that time disclosed the unit's
            contribution for the first time, saying revenue climbed 23
            percent in 2012 to $1.08 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The division has a global property and casualty reinsurance
            business as well as life and annuity reinsurance operations
            primarily in the U.S. Goldman Sachs agreed in 2012 to buy Ariel
            Holdings Ltd.'s Bermuda-based insurance and reinsurance
            businesses to expand property and casualty coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said last month that reinsurance revenue was $233
            million in the first quarter, up from $211 a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ebix Inc. (EBIX) jumped to its highest price
            in almost six months and topped a $20-a-share takeover bid from
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that would take the supplier of
            insurance software and services private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Ebix rose as much as 14 percent to $21.25, the
            highest intraday since Nov. 5, before settling to $20.52 at
            10:43 a.m. in New York. Goldman Sachs agreed to pay 18 percent
            more than the average daily closing price for the last 30 days,
            Atlanta-based Ebix said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement includes a 45-day window where Ebix can
            solicit other offers, according to the statement. Ebix said its
            special committee of independent directors unanimously supported
            the Goldman Sachs bid, which the companies valued at $820
            million including assumption of outstanding debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have great respect for Ebix and its strong commitment
            to providing customers with the highest quality of software and
            e-commerce services in the insurance industry,' Sumit Rajpal, a
            managing director at New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in the
            statement. 'We look forward to working with the company and
            helping it maximize its growth potential.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebix said in March that 2012 net income fell 1 percent to
            $70.6 million as revenue increased 18 percent to $199.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak
            is facing calls before a weekend election to justify a $3
            billion bond placement by the sovereign-wealth fund he leads,
            with opponents saying the deal was unnecessary and mispriced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman (GS) Sachs Group Inc. arranged the March 19 sale of 10-
            year debt by 1Malaysia Development Bhd., also known as 1MDB, and
            the notes were priced to yield 4.4 percent, 141 basis points
            more than sovereign Islamic dollar bonds due July 2021 were
            yielding at that time. The 1MDB yield was 3.76 percent today,
            giving investors who were in at the start a return of 5.7
            percent for the six weeks since the debt was issued. U.S.
            Treasuries gained 1.43 percent on average during the period,
            according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The private placement raised too many red flags, coming
            so close to the election date,' said Wong Chen, a 44-year-old
            corporate lawyer and a parliamentary candidate from the
            opposition National Justice Party. 'They were rushing this out
            and they don't know how to spend it. We don't know who received
            this private placement and who they may sell it on to.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Najib is chairman of the board of advisors of 1MDB and the
            March bond sale has given candidates opposing him in the May 5
            polls ammunition to criticize the fund, with Wong calling for
            more transparency. The accusations are part of a smear campaign
            before the voting, according to a government spokesman, who's
            not authorized to be named. Recent opinion polls suggest that
            the election will be tight with the opposition alliance having
            gained support in recent months, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            said in a report published today. &lt;/p&gt;

            second-largest maker of forklifts publicly confirmed plans to
            list in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company and its shareholders KKR Co. (KKR) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS), are 'actively monitoring the capital markets
            to decide on the timing of any potential transaction,' company
            spokesman Michael Hauger said in an e-mailed statement today.
            Kion hasn't yet decided on the final timing, he said, adding
            that an IPO would help to 'continue its profitable growth path
            and support its future strategic development.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion was part of German industrial-gas maker Linde AG
            before a 4-billion euro buyout in 2006. Sales increased 8.2
            percent to 4.7 billion euros last year even as global demand for
            industrial trucks dropped by 3.1 percent, as the company
            benefited from orders in China, where Kion is the largest
            overseas forklift-maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman Sachs have already lined up banks to handle
            the planned initial public offering of Kion, people with
            knowledge of the matter said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) was added to the list of financial
            institutions that already includes owners Goldman Sachs and
            KKR's equity capital markets arm as well as Deutsche Bank AG,
            said the people. The IPO will probably happen before July if
            markets remain stable and Wiesbaden, Germany-based Kion may sell
            as much as 25 percent of its stock, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR and Goldman sold 25 percent of Kion to Weichai Power
            Co., China's biggest maker of heavy-duty trucks, in August to
            help trim debt. Kion also sold 70 percent of its hydraulics unit
            to the Chinese firm. The moves brought Kion 738 million euros
            ($974 million) in investment from Weichai. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kion trails Toyota Industries Corp., an affiliate of Toyota
            Motor Corp., in the global forklift market. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>WTI-Brent 16-Month Low Pits Goldman Against BofA</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The collapse in the price difference
            between the world's two most-traded crude oil grades is
            fulfilling a prediction Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has held for
            more than a year. Bank of America Corp. says it won't last. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent crude's premium to West Texas Intermediate slumped
            more than 50 percent to a 16-month low in the past two months,
            falling to less than $10 a barrel for the first time since
            January 2012. The differential narrowed to as little as $8.66 a
            barrel today, after rising to a record $28.08 in October 2011.
            Brent was typically cheaper in the past decade, averaging $1.28
            a barrel less than WTI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The spread 'has been extremely volatile, moving one way
            and then another,' said Olivier Jakob, managing director at
            consultant Petromatrix GmbH in Zug, Switzerland. 'The question
            remains of where is the equilibrium price.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The divide between Brent, a gauge for more than half the
            world's oil, and WTI, the U.S. benchmark grade, has narrowed as
            North Sea supplies resumed following oilfield maintenance, while
            a switched pipeline began relieving a glut of crude at America's
            oil hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. Credit Suisse AG and Barclays Plc
            said in 2011 that the Cushing gridlock had made WTI so cheap
            relative to Brent, that the U.S. grade was losing its relevance
            as a global benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;North Sea &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brent has lost 9.6 percent in 2013, trading at $100.45 a
            barrel today on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange,
            after the restart of North Sea oil fields such as Buzzard and
            Elgin-Franklin in March. WTI on the New York Mercantile Exchange
            was at $91.45, little changed this year, as projects including
            Enterprise Products Partners LP and Enbridge Inc.'s Seaway
            pipeline eroded the glut at Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said since February 2012 that the gap
            would narrow, reiterating April 23 that it would shrink to about
            $5 a barrel in the third quarter as refiners in the Midwest
            boost operations after seasonal maintenance work and new U.S.
            supplies from Texas are redirected away from Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The entire balance at Cushing will shift from a small
            surplus into a pretty significant deficit over the next couple
            of months,' Stefan Wieler, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs
            in New York, said in a telephone interview on April 30. 'The
            bottleneck between Cushing, Oklahoma, and the Gulf Coast is
            starting to disappear. There are a number of pipelines that have
            been added, reversed or expanded that will make this happen.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Seaway Pipeline &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enterprise (EPD) and Enbridge's Seaway pipeline transported
            302,000 barrels a day from Cushing to the Gulf Coast in the week
            to April 26 after flows through the link were reversed last
            year, remote-sensing company Genscape Inc. said yesterday.
            Magellan Midstream Partners LP's Longhorn line, Sunoco Logistics
            Partners LP's Permian Express, and TransCanada Corp.'s Keystone
            XL project are also set to divert crude from Cushing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Bank of America, the narrowing of the spread is
            temporary, with the difference poised to rebound to $21 a barrel
            in the third quarter, according to an April 17 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market knows that this is all coming on stream, and
            is positioned for that,' Sabine Schels, a commodity strategist
            at Bank of America in London, said in an interview yesterday.
            'Our worry is that that production growth will eventually
            outpace the growth in pipeline capacity. And more importantly,
            what are refiners going to do with all that crude?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Refiners on the Gulf coast aren't configured to process the
            additional low-density, or 'light,' crude being produced,
            according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Catch On &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By the end of this year, the market will catch on to the
            fact that we're just going to push the inventories in Cushing
            down to the Gulf coast,' Schels said. 'That should lead to a
            wider spread again.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bank of America and Goldman WTI-Brent predictions are
            among the most divergent of analyst estimates compiled by
            Bloomberg. The median forecast for the third quarter is about
            $15 a barrel, and $12 for the fourth quarter, according to 36
            analyst predictions for WTI and 38 for Brent. Citigroup Inc. and
            Standard Chartered Bank Plc predict that the gap will end the
            year close to current levels, averaging $10 a barrel in the
            fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While 'U.S. shale oil production is flourishing,' putting
            downward pressure on WTI prices, 'pipelines are being built,
            reversed and expanded to accommodate the growth of local,
            abundant crude supply,' capping the spread, Ed Morse,
            Citigroup's global head of commodity research in New York, said
            in a report on April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hydraulic Fracturing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. crude production climbed to 7.33 million barrels a day
            in the week ended April 19, the highest level since April 1992,
            the Energy Department reported on April 24. Output has expanded
            20 percent in the past year as a combination of horizontal
            drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, unlocks supplies
            from shale formations in North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oil's so-called forward curve, formed by prices for
            successive monthly futures over the next decade, suggests the
            Brent-WTI spread may remain closer to Goldman's estimate in the
            third quarter than to Bank of America's. Brent contracts
            averaged over the third quarter are trading at a premium of
            $7.88 a barrel to the equivalent three-month average for WTI. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's what makes a market,' Marshall Berol, co-portfolio
            manager of the Encompass Fund in San Francisco, which has about
            $250 million in assets, said in a telephone interview. 'You get
            some people on one side of a question and others on the other
            side. It's a huge market, and a lot of people are playing in it
            with big bucks.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Derby's Falling Sky Shows Goldman Sachs's Covello Spreading Risk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Inc. partner James Covello says that when it comes to race horses, his work on
            Wall Street has taught him it's all about spreading the risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was still a big leap in
            purchasing a 40 percent stake in Falling Sky, one of 20 horses scheduled to run in the 139th Kentucky Derby
            at Churchill Downs (CHDN) in Louisville, Kentucky, in two days, Covello said. The 3-year-old went for
            $425,000 at the Ocala Breeders Sales Co. winter sale in January, by far the highest price of the session
            three years after the colt was purchased for $16,000 at Keeneland. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a calculated
            risk,' Covello, 40, said in a telephone interview. 'You have to be as analytical as possible in trying to
            marry the numbers.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Falling Sky will go off at 50-1 in the Derby, the first leg of
            thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown. Since Covello and his partners bought the colt, he has won the Sam F.
            Davis on Feb. 2, come in third at the Tampa Bay Derby on March 9 and fourth in the Arkansas Derby, the
            longest of his races at 1 1/8 miles, to earn $205,000 so far in 2013. The Kentucky Derby is 1 1/4 miles.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Covello, a semiconductor analyst at Goldman Sachs (GS), studies Thoro-Graph, a
            performance-rating number that is calculated on the basis of time of the race, beaten lengths, ground lost
            or saved, weight carried, the effect of wind, and a track variant. Falling Sky's number is 5, the same as
            Giacomo, a 50-1 longshot that captured the Derby in 2005 to return $102.60 on a $2 win bet. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Deal Averted Osborne Embarrassment, Group Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was able to
            avoid paying as much as 20 million pounds ($31 million) in U.K.
            taxes as the government fought to shield Chancellor of the
            Exchequer George Osborne from political embarrassment, an
            advocacy group said at a London trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group, UK Uncut, said Her Majesty's Revenue Customs
            reached the agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne
            announced a bankers' code to counter tax avoidance. The HMRC
            executive said in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was
            concerned the bank might drop out of the code if the deal was
            scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The reputation and standing of officials or of HMRC, and
            potential embarrassment to a minister, is not a relevant matter
            to take into account when deciding to waive collection of
            several million pounds of interest,' Ingrid Simler, a lawyer
            for UK Uncut, said in filings prepared for a judicial review
            that started in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-
            avoidance schemes following widespread media and public anger
            caused by the amount of corporation tax the likes of Google
            Inc. (GOOG), Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) pay in the country.
            Lawmakers said in a report last week that increased transparency
            about companies' tax affairs would build pressure on
            multinational businesses to 'pay a fair share.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Takes Ebix Private as Probes Said to Intensify</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) made its
            $820 million offer to take Ebix (EBIX) Inc. private as U.S. regulators
            intensify their probes of the insurance software maker,
            according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The all-cash deal amounts to about $20 a share, Atlanta-
            based Ebix said yesterday. Its shares jumped 11 percent on the
            news to $20.60 in Nasdaq trading, the biggest one-day gain since
            October 2011. The shares dropped 5.1 percent to $19.55 at
            12:26 p.m. today in New York. A 'go-shop' provision allows
            Ebix to solicit competing bids in the next 45 days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Should no better offer emerge, New York-based Goldman Sachs
            will become the owner of a company whose accounting practices
            were already under scrutiny by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission in November, according to four people with direct
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That probe, consisting of interviews with former employees,
            has since been upgraded to a formal investigation, according to
            a person who was briefed on the matter after the Goldman Sachs
            deal was announced and who asked not to be named because the
            matter was confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ebix is also the subject of an Internal Revenue Service
            investigation, according to this person, along with a second
            individual with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Americas Equities Co-Head Wang Plans to Retire</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ted Wang, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s
            co-head of equities trading for the Americas, is retiring after
            18 years at the company and will become an advisory director. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wang also was global co-head of the One Delta trading unit,
            according to an internal memo from trading co-heads Isabelle Ealet, Pablo Salame and Ashok Varadhan. Michael
            DuVally, a
            Goldman Sachs spokesman, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the top equity-trading bank last year,
            posted a 6 percent decline in first-quarter revenue for that
            business from a year earlier, the biggest drop among its U.S.
            peers. The firm said it had challenges in market-making in Japan
            and certain emerging-markets amid falling prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ted has played an integral role in the growth of our
            market-leading equities franchise and has been at the center of
            many of our most significant transactions,' Ealet, Salame and
            Varadhan wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So-called delta-one desks provide clients with strategies
            to hedge holdings or bet on directional moves in markets using
            derivatives or baskets of securities, which can be cheaper to
            trade than obtaining all of the stocks involved. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wang joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and became a partner in
            2006, according to the memo. He took on his most recent role in
            2012, after leading convertibles trading and the Americas One
            Delta business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter D. Selman is the other co-head for the Americas
            equities business, while Brian T. Levine serves as co-head of
            One Delta. DuVally declined to comment on whether new co-heads
            would be named. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to joining Goldman Sachs, Wang co-founded Xeotron
            Corp., a company that specialized in DNA biochips, according to
            a biography on the website of the Committee of 100, a
            nonpartisan group of Chinese Americans seeking to encourage
            positive relations between the two nations. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Fermaca Enterprises, owned by the Zug, Switzerland-based
            firm that specializes in private equity, sold $550 million of
            bonds overseas yesterday. The sale was the seventh first-time
            offering since August, when President Enrique Pena Nieto
            proposed changes to the state oil industry that were signed into
            law four months later. In the same span, only one debut issuer
            came from Brazil, the biggest developing-nation bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Partners Group, founded by three former Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. money managers in 1996, is seeking to profit from Mexico's
            energy industry after the government ended its 76-year-old oil
            monopoly and from a boom in shale gas, according to the firm's
            managing director, Jean Perarnaud. Fermaca, purchased from New
            York-based hedge fund Ospraie Management LLC for $750 million in
            February, has a 25-year transportation agreement with state-owned utility Comision Federal de Electricidad.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The momentum is there for Mexico, fundamentally and
            sentiment-wise,' Perarnaud said by phone. 'The timing is
            right.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Refinance Debt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fermaca, based in Mexico City, sold the bonds due 2038 to
            yield 6.375 percent. The senior secured amortizing notes, which
            will have an average maturity of 15 years, are backed by Fermaca
            assets including pipelines. Fitch Ratings and Standard Poor's
            rate the bonds BBB-, the lowest investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mexico's peso weakened 0.1 percent to 13.0537 per U.S.
            dollar at 7:02 a.m. in New York, paring its advance this week to
            0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Partners Group, started by Alfred Gantner, Marcel Erni and
            Urs Wietlisbach, will use proceeds of the sale to refinance both
            the debt that it took on to buy Fermaca and a loan the company
            used to finance construction of a pipeline, according to
            Perarnaud. It bought the 86 percent stake in Fermaca from
            Ospraie Management in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement with CFE will last throughout the life of the
            bonds, giving investors comfort that they will get paid, said
            Ray Zucaro, who manages $390 million at SW Asset Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That kind of long-term contract with government agencies
            beyond the life of the bond where effectively you neutralize
            that counterparty risk -- those are the kind of bonds that will
            let you sleep at night,' he said in a telephone interview from
            Newport Beach, California. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;CFE Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CFE, as the company is known, plans to take advantage of
            legal changes to the energy industry to sell natural gas, Chief
            Executive Officer Enrique Ochoa said March 20. After allowing
            foreign investors to drill for oil for the first time since
            1938, Mexico is looking to increase natural-gas supply, reduce
            its dependence on U.S. imports and lower the cost of electricity
            generation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That push will increase demand for Fermaca's gas pipelines,
            said Partners Group's Perarnaud. The company is also bidding on
            multiple pipeline contracts being auctioned by CFE, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We found Fermaca was the perfect asset,' Perarnaud said.
            'It would be an upside if the oil and gas exploration happen in
            Mexico because our pipelines are actually located in one of the
            prospective areas for shale gas in Mexico. When you combine
            everything together, you end up with a good story.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Fermaca is taking advantage of the investor demand
            for Mexican assets after the country passed constitutional
            changes in December, the company is not dependent on those
            measures to prosper in Mexico, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Secondary Laws &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After pushing through sweeping changes in his first year in
            office that earned Mexico its highest-ever credit rating, Pena
            Nieto has struggled to overcome opposition to pass the secondary
            laws needed to implement the new oil legislation, damping demand
            for Mexican assets. He submitted his proposals on April 30, the
            last day of the congressional session. Lawmakers plan to vote on
            the bills during special sessions in June after Congress missed
            a mid-April deadline to pass the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The delays helped spark a 0.14 percent loss in Mexican
            government debt in April, trailing the emerging-market average
            for the first time since January, according to Bank of America
            Corp. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Right Place' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fermaca is also the first debut issuer from Mexico since
            Oceanografia SA de CV defaulted on $495 million in February,
            when the government seized the oil services provider following
            allegations it took out a $400 million loan from Citigroup Inc.
            under fraudulent circumstances. Citigroup determined that
            Oceanografia, which provides oil services to state-run producer
            Petroleos Mexicanos, overstated the collateral from its billings
            to the company that were used to back the loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike Oceanografia's agreement with Pemex, Fermaca's
            contract with CFE doesn't involve a third party and is
            transparent, Perarnaud said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fermaca's 'in the right place at the right time,'Rafael Elias, a New York-based analyst at Credit
            Agricole SA, said in
            an April 22 note to clients. 'These bonds should do well.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Malaysian Bond Fees Would Face Scrutiny in Poll Upset</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Malaysia's opposition coalition led by
            Anwar Ibrahim may ask Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to renegotiate
            terms on a $3 billion bond placement should it win the election
            this weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank arranged the March 19 debt sale by 1Malaysia
            Development Bhd., a sovereign-wealth fund known as 1MDB headed
            by Prime Minister Najib Razak, whose political opponents have
            questioned the timing, cost and pricing of the issue. New York-
            based Goldman's fees exceeded $200 million for arranging the
            placement and three other dollar bond sales totaling $6.35
            billion by Malaysian issuers in the past two years, according to
            a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are really focused on corporate governance and should
            we win, we will review all public deals,' Rafizi Ramli,
            strategic director at Anwar's People's Justice Party, said in an
            interview in Kuala Lumpur today. 'The 1MDB transaction has been
            shrouded in secrecy. We would go back to the renegotiation table
            and see what would have been a fairer deal should there be any
            questionable part of the deal mix.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling National Front coalition is facing its fiercest
            challenge to date, after retaining power five years ago by the
            narrowest margin since Malaysia won independence from the U.K.
            in 1957. This is going to be the closest election Malaysia has
            had and there's a possibility the opposition will win, Kishore Mahbubani, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of
            Public Policy at
            the National University of Singapore, told Bloomberg TV today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to BNP Still Keen About Bonds Amid Streak: Poland Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Even after the longest run of gains in
            16 months for Poland's zloty bonds, BNP Paribas SA and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. say there's still reason to be bullish. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Government debt returned 1 percent in April and 3.6 percent
            during the past three months, the longest stretch since December
            2012, the Bloomberg Poland Local Sovereign Index shows. Yields
            on five-year notes reached 3.53 percent, 58 basis points less
            than this year's high and 302 basis points over similar German
            securities, compared with 272 on Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Policy maker Adam Glapinski told PAP newswire April 28 that
            the National Bank of Poland may be free to keep its benchmark
            rate at a record-low 2.50 percent until the middle of 2015 amid
            consumer-price growth 2.1 percentage points below its five-year
            average. BNP Paribas advises buying five-year zloty notes given
            'persistently low inflation' and prospects of quantitative
            easing by the European Central Bank, emerging-market strategists
            Piotr Chwiejczak and Dina Ahmad wrote in an April 29 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Poland is one foot in the euro area and will offer a
            positive real interest rate of about 2 percent in the next two
            years, while Europe will show negative real rates,' Chwiejczak
            said by phone from London on May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank pledged in March to keep rates on hold at
            least until the end of the third quarter as growth in the
            European Union's largest eastern economy accelerates without
            stoking price growth. Inflation stayed unchanged at 0.7 percent
            in March, leaving the real interest rate at 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ECB Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ECB will probably keep its benchmark rate at an all-time low of 0.25 percent at the next
            meeting on May 8, according
            to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
            Policy makers will take some sort of action within two months
            against the threat of low prices, which rose a less-than-forecast 0.7 percent in April, another survey
            showed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given the outlook for price growth across Europe, analysts
            will probably push back forecasts for Polish rate increases,
            creating scope for further bond gains, Andrew Matheny, an
            analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note on April 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Poland is seen raising rates by 50 basis points to 3
            percent in the first three months of next year and to 3.25
            percent by the end of the first half, according to the median
            estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'More Dovish' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our views are significantly more dovish than market
            pricing in Poland on a 12-18 month horizon,' which translates
            into a 'constructive outlook' on Polish bonds, Matheny wrote
            in the report. He predicted a 25 basis-point increase by the end
            of June 2015. The view was still valid on May 2, the bank's
            Frankfurt-based spokeswoman Katharina Jung said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders have scaled back bets for higher rates in Poland,
            now predicting less than a quarter-point increase over the next
            year, according to forward-rate agreements on May 2. That
            compares with expectations for a full 25 basis-point jump in the
            12 months from April 23 and more than a half-point increase in
            the year from Jan. 31, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The zloty slipped less than 0.1 percent to 4.2077 against
            the euro at 12:49 p.m. in Warsaw, taking its 2014 drop to 1.3
            percent. The additional yield on Poland's dollar bonds over
            Treasuries was unchanged at 119 basis points, JPMorgan Chase
            Co. indexes show. That compares with this year's low of 103
            basis points on April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Poland may decide to start raising rates in the fourth
            quarter as the economy accelerates, Andrzej Rzonca, a member of
            the central bank's Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview
            for newspaper Parkiet on May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The sooner we raise rates, the more gradual the increases
            will be and their total scale will be more limited,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Zloty Weakens &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inflation will probably accelerate to 1.3 percent this year
            from 0.9 percent in 2013, as the economy expands 3.2 percent,
            double last year's pace, according Bloomberg surveys of
            economists. The central bank is targeting price growth of 2.5
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An escalating crisis may damp economic expansion, shaving
            off about 0.6 percentage point from growth in the worst-case
            scenario, according to BNP's Chwiejczak. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Violence increased in Ukraine's easternmost regions as the
            government pursued its offensive to dislodge rebels and the
            conflict spread to the south. The easternmost area is
            'essentially at war,' the head of the country's anti-terrorist
            agency said May 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The geopolitical situation works toward lower inflation
            in Poland,' further supporting zloty bonds, Chwiejczak said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners Alison Mass and David Dase weren't buying. The bankers
            stared skeptically at a glass of brownish liquid as a young man described a new technology for purifying
            even the filthiest water. The sample was safe to drink, he said, taking a sip. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than
            1,000 investment-banking colleagues, watching a video of the encounter at a daylong strategy session at the
            New York Hilton Midtown in March, erupted in laughter. The man with the purification pitch was an actor.
            Mass and Dase, who weren't in on the joke, were doing their best to salvage a meeting that Goldman Sachs
            President Gary Cohn had asked each of them to take, Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its June 2014
            issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the video was the latest episode in a series of hidden-camera pranks
            targeting partners, a broader message wasn't hard to fathom: Goldman Sachs bankers have taken enough crap.
            Just a few years after the firm's reputation was sullied by sales of shoddy, crisis-era mortgage bonds,
            including one that an executive at the company described in an e-mail as a 'shitty deal,' the
            investment-banking unit is coming off one of its best years ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>And You Thought Goldman Didn't Give Superb Service: Opening Line</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein is sticking by Steven Cohen through thick and thin. While other banks have drifted
            away from the personal credit lines they've given Cohen since,
            well, you know, Goldman Sachs appears never to have wavered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The illustration of this is itself an intriguing look at
            finance so removed from the reality of normal humans, so lofty,
            that we'll call it cloud financing: Borrowing against the value
            of your priceless art collection for money that you can make
            work harder in your own investment shop to provide better
            returns. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sounding like a modern-day Barnes Foundation, the art
            collection that is the collateral to Goldman's private-banking
            loans is valued at $1 billion and sounds like the foundation for
            a foundation some day: Picasso, Van Gogh, Warhol and Pollock,
            Matisse and Hirst. The best art at the Opening Line bureau are
            watercolors painted by a grandmother. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is where Goldman's willing to go in search of a
            dollar, Miles Weiss's story shows, and to make sure it doesn't
            ever get too far from Cohen, whose former company, SAC, was
            paying banks $1 billion in commissions and fees annually,
            according to the Wall Street Journal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's probably smart business for both parties. But given
            all flies SAC was attracting for a while there, if authorities
            were able to come back with the case against Cohen they never
            had the first time, wouldn't this art be one of the first things
            to be liquidated? &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Names Mahoney for Asia Financial Institutions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;John Mahoney, a Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc. investment banker who leads the firm's efforts to advise
            U.S. lenders, is moving to Asia to head the financial-institutions group in that region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mahoney, 56, will replace Peter Enns, who's becoming chief
            executive officer of Goldman Sachs's business in Canada,
            according to an April memo to employees obtained yesterday by
            Bloomberg News. Kenneth Coquillette and Scott Romanoff will
            replace Mahoney as co-heads of the banking industry for FIG in
            the Americas, according to a separate memo last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global mergers and acquisitions involving financial
            companies totaled less than $1.2 trillion each of the past five
            years, after surpassing $2 trillion in 2007, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser
            on financial company deals so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mahoney will be head of FIG for Asia ex-Japan, based in
            Hong Kong, according to the April 11 memo from executives
            including FIG global co-heads Mike Esposito and Todd Leland.
            Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
            confirmed the contents of the memos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mahoney joined Goldman Sachs in 1987 and became a partner
            in 2000. He advised Toronto-Dominion Bank on its 2006 sale of TD
            Waterhouse USA to Ameritrade Holding Corp. and Countrywide
            Financial Corp. on its 2008 sale to Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Craig Murray and Bernard Teo were named co-chief operating
            officers of FIG for Asia ex-Japan under Mahoney. Goldman Sachs
            said last month that Enns, a Canadian, would move from Hong Kong
            to Toronto to replace Jack Curtin, 63, who's retiring at year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coquillette, co-head of investment banking for the Midwest
            region, joined Goldman Sachs in 1988 and became a partner in
            2010. He'll move from Chicago to New York in his new role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Romanoff, who joined in 1992 and was named a partner in
            2008, will continue to serve as co-head of the FIG financing
            group for the Americas, according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Supports Cohen With Loan Backed by Fine Art</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which stood
            by Steven A. Cohen last year as his SAC Capital Advisors LP bore
            the brunt of a massive insider trading probe, has come to the
            billionaire's aid again. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The top prime broker to the former hedge-fund firm, Goldman
            Sachs is making a personal loan to Cohen for the first time,
            according to a regulatory filing, joining the list of banks that
            have provided SAC's founder with credit lines backed by his $1
            billion art collection. Like Citigroup Inc. (C), JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Bank of America Corp., New York-based Goldman Sachs is
            making the loan through its private bank as part of an effort to
            expand its business catering to ultra-wealthy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
            President Gary Cohn expressed support for Cohen, 57, after SAC
            was indicted in July by federal regulators for insider trading,
            and continued to do business with the firm after it agreed to
            pay $1.8 billion in November to settle the charges. Goldman
            Sachs stepped in after Cohen had been seeking an art loan for
            months, having paid off and terminated his personal credit line
            from Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), said two people familiar with the matter,
            who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AIG Falls as Goldman Says Not Confident of Buybacks in Next Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG) fell
            the most among large financial firms after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. said U.S. oversight may limit the insurer's ability to buy
            back shares in the next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AIG dropped 2.6 percent to $44.29 at 12:33 p.m. in New
            York, the biggest decline in the 81-company Standard Poor's
            500 Financials Index. Goldman Sachs analysts led by Michael Nannizzi cut AIG to neutral from buy in a note
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robert Benmosche, chief executive officer of New York-based
            AIG since 2009, redeemed debt and struck a deal to sell a plane-
            leasing unit as he seeks to bolster the company's credit rating
            and win confidence of regulators. The insurer halted dividends
            in 2008, the year of a U.S. rescue, and is overseen by the
            Federal Reserve after repaying the bailout funds in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are not confident that AIG's priority for the next 12
            months will shift toward buybacks until it has satisfied both
            rating agencies and regulators, the latter of which will reflect
            a yet undefined framework and timeline,' the Goldman Sachs
            analysts wrote. The insurer also faces the risks of 'credit and
            interest-rate volatility, and an inability to adequately
            monetize non-core assets along the anticipated timeline.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer last year became the first non-bank to disclose
            it's under consideration to be labeled a potential risk to the
            financial system because of its size. Benmosche said in a letter
            to the Fed in November that he welcomes supervision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AIG surged 39 percent in 12 months through yesterday as
            Benmosche repaid the bailout, and results improved at the global
            property-casualty and U.S. life businesses that are the main
            units of a scaled-back company. The insurer last week posted
            first-quarter operating profit of $1.34 a share, beating by 46
            cents the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see limited upside to our $46, 12 month-price
            target,' the analysts said. 'Current shares now well reflect
            the fundamental story.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jon Diat, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Closes Real Estate Credit Fund at $4.2 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            shifted its real estate focus to lending from buying properties
            after the financial crisis, completed fundraising for its second
            real estate credit pool at $4.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm raised $1.8 billion in equity
            pledges from institutions and wealthy individuals, supplemented
            by the same amount in borrowings and $600 million of the firm's
            own money, said Alan Kava, co-head of the real estate investing
            group in Goldman's merchant banking division. About 60 percent
            of the capital pledged came from U.S. investors and most of the
            rest was from Europe, with a small amount from Asian investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman is competing with other private debt funds,
            mortgage-oriented real estate investment trusts and banks in
            offering ways to earn higher yields at a time of low interest
            rates. The new vehicle will invest in Europe and the U.S.,
            expanding on Goldman's first real estate credit fund, which made
            about $3.5 billion of loans, according to a marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will be opportunistic in terms of where we see
            value,' Kava said in a telephone interview. 'The first fund
            was U.S. only. We're hopeful we will end up with about 50-50'
            between the U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new Broad Street Real Estate Credit Partners II plans
            to make senior loans and mezzanine loans backed by high-quality
            commercial real estate, to fund acquisitions, refinancings and
            recapitalizations, according to the document. It intends to
            generate returns in the 'mid-teens' by charging interest rates
            of 7 percent to 10 percent and leveraging the equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Current Yield &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund will make and hold the loans, distributing the
            interest income it receives to investors quarterly, said Peter
            Weidman, the managing director who oversees the new fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What our investors like about this is it's a current
            yield so we're not just making one-time distributions by
            securitizing,' Weidman said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund has invested about $500 million already, in
            five deals, according to the marketing document. They include a
            mezzanine loan to help finance the purchase of a group of
            Southern California office buildings, and a senior loan, or
            first mortgage, on a New York City rental apartment building
            that's being converted to for-sale condominiums. Higher-yielding
            mezzanine loans are used to fill the gap between first mortgages
            and equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's first real estate credit fund, known as Real
            Estate Mezzanine Partners, made 28 investments, about two-thirds
            of which were senior mortgages and one-third mezzanine loans,
            according to the marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a competitive advantage by focusing on larger
            deals and being able to provide the entire loan to our
            borrowers,' Weidman said. 'We see less competition in the
            larger loan space.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new fund has an investment period of three years, with
            possible extensions, according to the marketing document. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Prison Play: Goldman Bets on Gang Members Staying Out of Jail</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which wagered more than $300 billion last year on things like yen rates
            and bond spreads, just laid down a bet that guys like Nelson 'Johnny' Aguilar can stay out of jail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aguilar was at a Dunkin' Donuts near Boston on a Sunday night in March when a shooting outside left
            a 21-year-old man with a bullet wound to the gut, police said. They arrested Aguilar, a 19-year-old gang
            member with a criminal record and a tattoo that says 'Life's a Gamble.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such
            crime-blotter moments are Goldman's concern thanks to a financial product called a social-impact bond.
            Goldman is anchoring a $21 million plan to help a Boston-area nonprofit called Roca expand its efforts to
            steer young men like Aguilar away from dealing drugs, stealing cars or committing assaults and murders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the deal, if men targeted by Roca spend 22 percent fewer days in jails and prisons than their
            peers, Massachusetts would save enough to repay Goldman's $9 million loan. An even bigger drop in recidivism
            would hand Goldman as much as $1 million in profit. If Roca fails and too many men end up behind bars,
            Goldman will lose almost everything it ventured. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's not that different than if you
            were looking at any company' to invest in, said Andrea Phillips, vice president of Goldman's Urban
            Investment Group, who leads the bank's social-impact bond transactions. 'You're relying on a management
            team. You're relying on their human capital, their folks who work at the plant and deliver and do what
            they're supposed to do.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young men like Aguilar are
            part of the bottom line: Each participant Roca keeps out of jail for a year saves Massachusetts $12,400, the
            state calculated. If it can close a 300-person facility and keep from expanding jail space, it could save
            $47,500 per person per year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Lost Money on Two Days in First Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
            generated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,
            posted losses from that business on two days in the first three
            months of 2013, compared with one day a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's traders made more than $100 million on 17 days
            in the quarter ended March 31, compared with 24 days in the
            year-earlier period, the New York-based company said in a
            regulatory filing today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank generated $5.22 billion from its trading division
            in the first quarter of 2013, excluding accounting charges, a 12
            percent declined from the year-earlier period. About $230
            million of that revenue came from a reinsurance business the
            firm sold a majority stake in this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Clients were 'more active really in the first month of the
            quarter and then it slowed down a bit in March,' Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. 'As issues
            started to come back more on to front screens as it relates to
            issues in Europe, clients obviously pulled back toward the end
            of the quarter.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) had perfect
            trading records in the first quarter, making money on every day
            of the period, while Morgan Stanley posted losses in eight
            sessions. Citigroup Inc. doesn't disclose money-losing days. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ocado Surges to Two-Year High as Goldman Raises Stock to Buy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado Group Plc, (OCDO) the U.K.'s largest
            online-only grocer, jumped to the highest in more than two years
            in London trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised the
            stock to buy, saying sales growth is set to accelerate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares rose as much as 20 percent to 250.3 pence, the
            highest price since Feb. 21, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman analyst Franklin Walding said today that he expects
            Ocado to generate 20 percent sales growth in 2017 as the opening
            of a second distribution center in central England eases
            capacity constraints. He estimates that the company will have an
            8 percent share of the U.K. online grocery market by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ocado's online food retail business model has an inherent
            advantage relative to traditional peers,' Walding wrote in a
            report. 'Its lower capital intensity means the group can
            successfully operate at a lower margin than store-based peers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado shares have almost tripled this year on optimism that
            the new warehouse will help accelerate sales growth and after
            the company said in March it's in talks with William Morrison
            Supermarkets Plc (MRW) to license some of its Web-shopping technology.
            Those discussions are continuing, the company said today in a
            statement, adding that its supply agreement with the Waitrose
            grocery chain won't be affected by the potential tie-up. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Any agreement with Morrison would be 'complementary to
            Ocado's existing partnership with Waitrose, which would be
            unaffected,' said the Hatfield, England-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado traded at 233.4 pence as of 10:20 a.m., up 12 percent
            and valuing the company at 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Morrison Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The bounce today is down to Goldman's upgrade and the
            fact that Ocado is a highly shorted, low liquidity stock, so
            even a tiny bit of news has a big impact on the share price,'
            said Andrew Gwynn, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London who
            has a buy recommendation on the stock. 'That also explains why
            the share price has moved so much in recent days.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado said March 14 it had started talks with Bradford,
            England-based Morrison to support the start of the supermarket
            chain's online business next year. Any partnership won't involve
            a takeover or Morrison acquiring a stake, it repeated today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not all analysts have a positive opinion on Ocado. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The shares have been squeezed up by the hope that
            strategic value could be about to be unlocked by corporate
            activity, but the reality is that the strategic value in Ocado
            is substantially lower than these unrealistic expectations
            anticipate, because it remains a fundamentally flawed model,'
            Philip Dorgan, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said in a
            note today. He maintained a sell recommendation on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado also said today that sales have continued to rise and
            that 'the board is encouraged by the progress of the business
            so far this year, and believes the company is well placed to
            exploit the fast growth in online grocery retailing.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
            the country's fifth-biggest lender, hired Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc.'s Michael Freeborn as head of energy investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Freeborn will oversee that business from Calgary, the
            Toronto-based firm said today in an internal memo. He'll replace
            Mark Horsfall, who was appointed vice-chairman of investment
            banking starting in August, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Freeborn previously led Goldman Sachs's Canadian energy
            investment banking business from Calgary. Before joining the New
            York-based firm in 2005, he worked for CIBC in both Calgary and
            Toronto. He'll report to Geoff Belsher, group co-head of

        <headline>Stemcor Said to Hire Goldman Sachs as It Seeks Loan Standstill</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stemcor Holdings Ltd., a London-based
            steel trader, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise it on a
            debt refinancing and potential asset sales as the company seeks
            to repay a $850 million facility that matured this week,
            according to three people with knowledge of matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is advising Stemcor as it discusses with lenders a
            so-called standstill agreement, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the negotiations are private. The steel
            trader is seeking an agreement to extend and reduce the size of
            the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company reported a loss last year as turnover fell to
            about 5 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) from about 6 billion
            pounds a year earlier, according to a statement on its website.
            Reduced demand for steel in recession-hit Europe drove down the
            prices of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel product, 15 percent
            in the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Charles Armitstead, a London-based Stemcor spokesman who
            works for Pendomer Communications LLP, and Goldman Sachs
            spokeswoman Joanna Carss declined to comment on the financing or
            the bank's advisory role. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The standstill, under which banks agree not to demand
            repayment of the loan for a specified period of time, would also
            apply to a one-year $225 million loan raised by Stemcor's Asian
            unit Stemcor SEA Pte Ltd., one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stemcor was founded in 1951 and the majority of its shares
            are held by the Oppenheimer family, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rio Bond Risk Withstands Goldman Iron Ore Dusk</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Debt investors are betting
            Australia's iron-ore producers will survive what Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. has described as the dusk of a bull market as they
            improve balance sheets and cut production costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bond risk for BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio Tinto Group fell
            this quarter even as prices of the steelmaking ingredient
            slumped 11 percent, according to CMA credit-default swap
            pricing. Contracts for Rio, which last year got 87 percent of
            its profit from iron ore, were at 93 basis points on May 8, 12
            below this year's high. Those for BHP dropped to 61 basis points
            from as high as 71. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'BHP and Rio have been lifting production while also
            taking out costs,' Ben Byrne, a credit sector specialist at
            Citigroup Inc. in Sydney, said by phone May 9. 'These efforts
            have offset weaker commodity prices to some degree.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman wrote in a May 7 report that over-investment in new
            supply means dusk is settling on the iron-ore bull market from
            2004 to 2013, which will force mine closures among high-cost
            producers. BHP and Rio, the world's two biggest mining
            companies, are reining in investment and cutting debt after a
            decade-long boom in metal prices slowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rio plans to reduce spending on new operations to about $8
            billion in 2015, less than half its outlay in 2012. BHP is
            focusing on the highest-returning projects and plans to spend
            $16 billion during fiscal 2014 on new projects and exploration,
            down from $22 billion the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bond Dearth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The austerity drive, which includes slashing operating
            costs, is set to reduce net debt for both companies. Rio's may
            fall 21 percent to $14.2 billion in 2015 compared with this
            year, RBC Capital Markets forecast this month. BHP's net debt
            may fall 45 percent to $13.7 billion in fiscal 2015, RBC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The savings drive by the miners means there's a smaller
            pool of debt for bond investors to choose from, said Chris Walter, a credit analyst in Sydney at Westpac
            Banking Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's little to no supply of cash bonds in the near
            term' from mining companies, Walter said. 'Credit investors
            still need to put their money to work in a low-yield
            environment, so it's not surprising we're seeing further spread
            tightening' in CDS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BHP and Rio have both predicted lower iron-ore prices this
            year after producers in Australia and Brazil spent billions of
            dollars to expand output. After a balanced export market in 2013
            totaling 1.2 billion metric tons, Goldman Sachs forecasts a
            surplus of about 77 million tons this year, rising to about 145
            million tons next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Metrics Strained &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. dollar debt issued by Rio returned 1.7 percent this
            quarter through May 8 while BHP's gained 1.6 percent, according
            to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Metals, Mining Steel
            Index. The gauge advanced 2.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Australia's 10-year bond yield fell to an seven-month low
            of 3.80 percent last week, before closing at 3.82 percent. It
            offered a 1.21 percentage point pick-up over similar-maturity
            U.S. Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Aussie dollar, the world's fifth most-traded currency,
            fetched 93.56 U.S. cents as of 5 p.m. in Sydney on May 9, having
            gained 4.9 percent since Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Growth in China, the biggest buyer of iron ore, is slowing
            after the government reined in a credit boom and toughened
            regulation to combat pollution. The economy expanded 7.4 percent
            in the first quarter from a year earlier, matching the weakest
            pace since 2009. Premier Li Keqiang is targeting growth of 7.5
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore entered a bear market in March and fell to $103.70
            a ton on May 8, the lowest level since September 2012, taking
            this year's price drop to 23 percent. The average annual price
            is forecast to decline each year until at least 2017, according
            to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If iron ore fell to $80 or $90 a ton in the next couple
            of years, Rio's credit metrics could become strained for its
            current A- and A3 ratings,' said Byrne. 'However there is
            little risk of a credit event given the company's scale and
            strong liquidity.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Mercuria Said to Hire Ex-Goldman Commodity Co-Head Shenouda</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. hired
            former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner Magid Shenouda as global
            head of trading, the most senior ex-banker to join the Swiss
            commodity firm, said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shenouda, the former London-based co-head of Goldman's
            global commodities unit, will also join the fast-growing
            trader's board of directors, said the person, who asked not to
            be identified because the decision hasn't been made public. The
            appointment was announced today in a memo to Mercuria staff seen
            by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As investment banks pull back from commodities amid
            heightened regulatory scrutiny, firms like Mercuria are snapping
            up high-profile talent and assets. The company agreed in March
            to buy JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM)'s physical commodity business for
            $3.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria has offered jobs to about 200 people from the
            JPMorgan unit. Etienne Amic, managing director for European
            energy trading at JPMorgan in London, will join the firm, said
            people with knowledge of the matter. Raj Chawla, JPMorgan's head
            of China commodities, will become Asia Pacific chief operating
            officer based in Singapore, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercuria spokesman Benoit Lioud declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shenouda will be the number three executive at the Geneva-based company after co-founders Marco
            Dunand and Daniel Jaeggi,
            one of the people said. A 14-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, he
            takes over the head trading role from Jaeggi, who will focus
            more on strategy and the integration of the JPMorgan business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Sphere &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In less than a decade, the founders have transformed
            Mercuria from a 10-person company supplying oil to a pair of
            Polish refineries into the world's fourth-largest independent
            commodity trader with revenue topping $112 billion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seeking to join the top sphere of independent trading firms
            such as Vitol Group and Trafigura Beheer BV, Mercuria has hired
            570 staff from 2011 to 2013 including key executives from
            investment banks. It now has about 1,200 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appointments included Houston-based Shameek Konar, a
            former managing director at Goldman who is chief investment
            officer overseeing Mercuria's corporate development including
            the JPMorgan acquisition. Victoria Attwood Scott, Mercuria's
            head of compliance, also joined from Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Former Traders &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Roger Jones, the ex-head of commodities at Barclays Plc (BARC) who
            has spent more than a quarter-century trading, was hired in 2012
            to lead its non-oil business and join the board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shenouda, whose recruitment by Mercuria was reported
            earlier by the Wall Street Journal, left Goldman last year,
            according to an internal memo confirmed by the bank on Oct. 29.
            He joined New York-based Goldman in 1999 and became a partner in
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before he was the co-head of Goldman's global commodity
            business, Shenouda ran the bank's European crude oil and
            products trading unit as well as its European gas and power
            trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman traders themselves, Dunand and Jaeggi will
            significantly increase Mercuria's gas and power trading with the
            JPMorgan deal. The company has offered jobs to about 200
            JPMorgan traders, or about half of the commodity business staff,
            a person with knowledge of the matter said this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blythe Masters, head of JPMorgan's commodity unit, will
            leave the bank once the sale of the business is completed, the
            firm said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks from Barclays to Morgan Stanley (MS) are exiting or
            shrinking their commodities businesses as regulators crack down
            on risk and as revenue falls. Sales for the 10 largest
            investment-bank commodity businesses fell to $4.5 billion in
            2013 from $14 billion in 2008, according to London-based
            analytics company Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Arcapita to Weigh Loan Offers From Fortress, Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita Bank BSC, an Islamic-compliant fund manager, will consider a revised offer for a
            bankruptcy-exit loan from Fortress Credit Corp. to compete with
            a proposal from Goldman Sachs International. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both loan offers of $350 million would fund Arcapita's exit
            from Chapter 11 protection, Fortress said in papers filed today
            in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Fortress said it had been
            in talks since last year to provide an exit loan to Arcapita and
            was disappointed that the company and its creditors' committee
            chose the Goldman Sachs offer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is unclear to Fortress why both the debtors and the
            committee have lent their support to the GSI proposal,'
            Fortress said in its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress, which is also an agent to Arcapita's bankruptcy
            operating loan, said that the Goldman Sachs proposal may have
            been influenced by a conflict of interest and might allow some
            unsecured creditors, including members of the creditors'
            committee, to improve their positions in Arcapita's capital
            structure relative to other unsecured creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita and its creditors will 'seek approval of the best
            exit facility proposal, whether that proposal comes from
            Fortress or GSI,' Fortress said. A hearing is set for May 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;No Fees &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress said its revised offer would fund Arcapita's exit
            at a better price, doesn't include administrative fees, and
            won't make Arcapita pay if it enters into an alternative
            transaction. Fortress also would allow Arcapita keep as much as
            $30 million in sale proceeds, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita, based in Manama, Bahrain, filed for Chapter 11
            protection in March 2012 after being unable to complete an out-of-court restructuring of $1.1 billion in
            unsecured debt. It
            listed assets of $3.06 billion and debt of $2.55 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When its bankruptcy began, Arcapita had interests in 39
            companies, and $7 billion in assets under management. Arcapita
            has minority interests in 80 percent of its investments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Arcapita Bank BSC, 12-bk-11076, U.S. Bankruptcy
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Investors Should Oppose Pay Plan, Glass Lewis Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS). shareholders should vote against the bank's executive-pay plan,
            proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis Co. said, while ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA supported the program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been 'deficient' in linking compensation to company performance, Glass Lewis said
            yesterday in a report, which also opposed the re-election of compensation committee Chairman James A.
            Johnson. ISS said in a May 8 report that shareholders should vote for Johnson at the New York-based bank's
            May 23 annual meeting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, received $21
            million for last year, his highest annual compensation package since 2007. Goldman Sachs shares climbed 41
            percent in 2012, leaving them 24 percent below the level at which they ended 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs doesn't have specific measures to help set annual pay for top executives, Glass Lewis said in the
            report, which gave the firm a 'D' grade in linking pay to performance. ISS said the increase in executive
            pay for 2012 reflected stronger company performance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the bank has topped peers in
            earnings-per-share growth and return on equity, it has trailed in total shareholder return, according to
            Glass Lewis's analysis. Glass Lewis recommended last year that shareholders back the pay plan in an advisory
            vote, and the measure was approved with 94 percent support. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Technology Banker Noto to Join Hedge Fund Coatue</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc.'s head banker on Twitter Inc.'s initial public offering
            last year, is leaving to join hedge-fund firm Coatue Management
            LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dan Dees, who became co-head of technology, media and
            telecommunications banking with Noto earlier this year, will
            become sole leader of the group, according to an internal memo.
            David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed
            the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the top-ranked adviser on mergers and
            acquisitions involving technology, media and telecommunications
            companies last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Noto, 46, rejoined the firm in 2010 after leaving in 2008 to
            become chief financial officer of the National Football League. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coatue, which manages about $9.2 billion, was founded in
            1999 by Philippe Laffont, who worked for Julian Robertson at
            Tiger Management LLC, according to a regulatory filing last
            month. Coatue managed the 20th-most-profitable hedge fund in the
            world last year, according to Bloomberg Rankings. The New York-based firm has made investments in technology
            companies such as
            Snapchat Inc. and Flipboard Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anthony is a key addition to our private investing
            effort, helping us build on the momentum we have established,'
            Laffont said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Noto's move was reported earlier today by website Re/Code. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Big Personalities' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Simon Holden, Nick Giovanni and Michael Ronen will become
            co-chief operating officers of the group at Goldman Sachs,
            according to the memo. Holden runs the telecommunications sector
            and leads the TMT group in Europe. Giovanni is head of the
            Internet sector, while Ronen leads the media and
            telecommunications MA business in the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dees was co-head of the investment-banking division for
            Asia Pacific ex-Japan before moving back to the U.S. to take the
            TMT job. George Lee and Gene Sykes will remain co-chairmen of
            the TMT group, according to a memo sent by investment banking
            co-heads Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Deals in technology, media and telecom are really
            interesting to the world, they involve really big
            personalities,' Lee said in a March interview. 'It's a big
            revenue and profit contributor, and it's so high-profile that
            our success there has an overweight impact on the way people
            perceive our overall franchise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;West Point &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Noto, a football player at the U.S. Military Academy at
            West Point, New York, trained to be a member of the Army Rangers
            and spent time in the Middle East while serving as a signal
            officer in the infantry. He was a research analyst covering
            Internet companies in his first stint at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since returning to the firm, Noto has competed with Morgan
            Stanley (MS) for the lead spot on a string of high-profile IPOs.
            Goldman Sachs led the offerings for Yelp Inc. and Twitter, while
            Morgan Stanley won the prime spot on LinkedIn Corp. and Facebook
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'My last four years at Goldman Sachs have been as equally
            rewarding as the first nine years,' Noto said in an e-mailed
            statement. 'The TMT franchise has never been stronger and I
            look forward to seeing the continued success of such a fantastic
            team and to working with the firm as a client.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells Second-Largest Callable Step-Up Note of 2013</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $31
            million of 15-year callable step-up notes, the second-largest
            such offering in the U.S. this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities, issued May 8, yield 3.25 percent for the
            first eight years, then increase five more times to 7.5 percent
            for the last year, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S.
            Securities and Exchange Commission. The New York bank and
            Incapital LLC distributed the notes for a 3.24 percent fee. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has the option to call the notes quarterly
            starting Nov. 13, according to the prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold $42 million of 15-year callable step-up
            notes in two related offerings on Feb. 19 and 25, the biggest
            such deal this year. The securities yield 3.5 percent annually
            for the first eight years, then increase four times to 7.5
            percent during the last six months, according to a prospectus
            filed with the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has issued the most rate-tied notes in the
            U.S. this year, $418.9 million, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The bank was also No. 1 for all of 2012, selling
            $1.14 billion of the securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
            derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
            earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
            value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
            or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Trader Saiz's Fund Assets Drop 86% Following Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Vector Commodity Management LLP's
            assets under management slumped 86 percent this year after
            losing money since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The energy hedge fund run by former Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. trader Gilbert Saiz managed $43 million by the end of
            April, according to a letter to investors obtained by Bloomberg
            News. Its December statement showed assets of $318 million.
            Vector's trading of mainly crude and oil products resulted in a
            4.9 percent loss from January through April, the letter showed.
            A Vector executive in London, who asked not to be named in line
            with company policy, declined to comment by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodity hedge funds have struggled to turn a profit in
            recent years as global economic and political developments
            whipsawed markets. Hedge funds tracked by the Newedge Commodity
            Trading Index lost an average 0.5 percent in the first four
            months and 1.1 percent in April alone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It has been an extremely difficult year for oil
            traders,' Stephen Schork, president of the Schork Group, said
            by phone from Villanova, Pennsylvania. 'A lot of investment has
            been finding its way into commodity funds on the long side, and
            the economic realities of not enough demand and too much supply
            have caught a lot of these funds off guard.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Wins Dismissal of Abacus CDO Suit on Appeal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
            dismissal of bond insurer ACA Financial Guaranty Corp.'s fraud
            lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A New York state appeals court in Manhattan today ordered
            the complaint against Goldman Sachs dismissed, overturning a
            lower-court ruling that had allowed the case to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA claimed that New York-based Goldman Sachs and hedge-fund firm Paulson Co. conspired to induce
            ACA to provide
            financial guaranty insurance for the Abacus transaction and
            deceived the insurer into believing Paulson was a long investor
            when in fact it was taking a short position. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeals court said ACA could have uncovered Paulson's
            actual position, 'but apparently chose not to.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Plaintiff should have questioned defendant or the non-party hedge fund,' the court said. 'Such an
            inquiry would have
            likely informed plaintiff that the nonparty hedge fund was
            taking a short rather than a long equity position.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ACA added New York-based Paulson as a defendant in the
            lawsuit this year. A court has yet to rule on the hedge fund's
            motion to dismiss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marc Kasowitz, an attorney for New York-based ACA, said his
            client may ask the divided appellate panel to reconsider the
            decision and would pursue an appeal to the state's highest court
            in Albany. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Two-Judge Dissent' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As the two-judge dissent makes clear, the three-judge
            majority's line of reasoning neither comports with the factual
            record nor the law on this issue,' Kasowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in July 2010 won court approval of a
            $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission over claims that it misled investors in the Abacus
            CDO. Goldman Sachs failed to disclose Paulson's role in
            selecting underlying securities or that Paulson had taken a
            short position against the CDO, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank didn't admit or deny wrongdoing in the SEC
            settlement. It acknowledged that it made a 'mistake' and that
            marketing materials for the instruments had 'incomplete
            information,' the agency said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. v. Goldman Sachs
            Co., 650027-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Commodities Appeal as World Economy Recovers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities as an asset class remain
            appealing as the global economic recovery extends into 2015,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank raised its 12-month allocation for commodities to
            neutral from underweight, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie and
            Damien Courvalin wrote in a report dated yesterday. They
            increased their three and six-month price forecasts for nickel
            and rolled the 12-month predictions for aluminum and zinc
            forward to higher levels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw materials as measured by total returns on the Standard
            Poor's GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index added 4.2 percent this
            year as global equities increased 2.3 percent and the Bloomberg
            U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose 2.7 percent. Citigroup Inc. said
            last month it was time to take commodities seriously again to
            diversify investment portfolios after they beat equities and
            bonds in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Commodities have been caught in a tug of war,' the
            Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. 'As the global business cycle
            shifts into an expansion phase over the next few years we expect
            commodity performance to improve.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Total returns for the enhanced index may be zero percent
            over the next three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
            months, according to the bank. It expected the gauge to drop 4
            percent over 12 months in an April 13 note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asset Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to believe the commodity super cycle is
            over,' Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president
            in New York, said in a telephone interview on March 28. 'That
            doesn't mean that there is going to be an absence of seasonality
            and cyclical turns in the asset market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Barclays survey published in an April 4 report showed 54
            percent of investors planned to boost their stake in commodities
            in the next 12 months versus 27 percent who did in the preceding
            year, according to analysts led by Kevin Norrish. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There has been little clear directionality in commodity
            markets over the past month, the Goldman analysts said. Tension
            in Ukraine has supported corn and wheat even as global
            agriculture stockpiles remain elevated, while weakness in the
            Chinese property sector weighed on copper amid a seasonal pick-up in demand, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As growth accelerates, supply and demand fundamentals in
            base metals are expected to tighten by the middle of next year,
            the bank said. It raised its six-month forecast for nickel to
            $22,000 a metric ton from $20,000 amid supply disruptions at
            Vale SA's New Caledonia plant, Indonesia's ban on ore exports
            and tension between Russia and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman kept its 12-month nickel target at $16,000 as
            Chinese producers will probably increase blast furnace nickel
            pig iron capacity in Indonesia over the next one to two years.
            Nickel for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange has
            climbed 49 percent this year to $20,728 by 4:33 p.m. in
            Singapore today. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects age of Sago in second paragraph of story
            published May 14.) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Katsunori Sago, deputy president of
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Japanese unit, will leave the firm
            where he began his career 22 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sago, 46, will resign from his post in June and serve as an
            advisory director and vice chairman until he departs by March
            31, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, said by phone
            today. The company has no plan to fill the deputy president
            position, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among his roles, Sago served as co-chairman of the bank's
            diversity committee in Asia. Goldman Sachs formed a daycare
            center in Tokyo in 2009 and has been running a campaign under
            the banner 'Womenomics' to urge Japan's government and
            companies to promote women in the workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two women were among nine Japan employees who were promoted
            to managing director in January, according to the Wall Street
            firm's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sago is also head of the company's securities division in
            Japan. That post will be filled by Mark Agne and Hidehiro Imatsu, according to an internal memo obtained by
            Bloomberg
            News. Matsumoto confirmed the contents of the document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sago joined Goldman Sachs in Tokyo in 1992 after graduating
            from the University of Tokyo's engineering school. He worked in
            fixed-income trading and became a managing director in 1999
            before joining the Japan unit's board in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Citi Hired to Manage Delek Group Spinoff of Energy Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG), the Israeli
            conglomerate with interests from energy to insurance, picked
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. to set up a company
            to hold its energy activities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks will also manage the new unit's listing abroad,
            Itay Gore, a spokesman for the Netanya-based Delek, confirmed. A
            time frame hasn't been set for the spinoff or the share sale,
            which will probably be in London, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Delek's structural change, announced in December, will
            enable a larger and more varied group of investors to access the
            company's activities, Asaf Bartfeld, the group's chief executive
            officer, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Delek shares have advanced more than 50 percent in the past
            12 months, making them the best performers on the TA-25
            benchmark index. The company has been selling non-energy assets
            to focus on its oil and gas business, and the offshore Tamar
            natural gas field, in which it holds stakes via units, started
            production in March last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Kenneth Heebner Buys Goldman Sachs, Hertz; Sells BofA, Herbalife</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Kenneth Heebner, who once ranked as
            America's No. 1 stock picker, took new positions in Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ), while selling
            out of Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heebner's Capital Growth Management LP purchased 843,000
            shares of Goldman Sachs during the first quarter, based on a
            filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The money
            manager bought 4.9 million shares of auto-rental chain Hertz
            Global. Capital Growth sold $152.1 million of Bank of America
            shares and $110.2 million of Herbalife, a marketer of
            nutritional supplements, in the three months ended March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heebner's CGM Focus Fund (CGMFX) topped all diversified U.S. stock
            mutual funds in the decade through 2007 and has returned 22
            percent this year, beating 99 percent of its peers, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. The Boston-based fund's assets
            plunged to $1.5 billion at the end of October from the June 2008
            peak of $10.3 billion, as it lost an annual 8.9 percent in the
            past five years, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has surged 22 percent this year compared with
            the 16 percent gain in the Standard Poor's 500 Index. The Wall
            Street bank, which generates the highest percentage of sales
            from trading, reported last month that revenue from that
            business fell more than its rivals during the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by revenue,
            has climbed 16 percent in 2013. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said in April mortgage banking
            and trading marred
            first-quarter results and slowed the company's turnaround. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hertz, the largest publicly traded U.S. rental-car
            operator, is awaiting U.S. antitrust approval for its
            acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group. Shares have
            surged 54 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Heebner's firm added to its stake in Herbalife in the
            fourth quarter when shares plunged 31 percent after hedge-fund
            manager Bill Ackman accused the company of operating a pyramid
            scheme. Herbalife has surged 37 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capital Growth also exited positions in Ford Motor Co. and
            Foot Locker Inc. during the first quarter. The firm also bought
            homebuilder NVR Inc. and BlackRock Inc., the world's largest
            asset manager. While Heebner's firm remained bullish on housing
            stocks, with Lennar Corp. and DR Horton Inc. among the five
            biggest holdings, the biggest decreases in market value was to
            PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money manager's stake in financial companies remained
            the biggest allocation out of 10 industries. Citigroup Inc. and
            Morgan Stanley remained the firm's two largest holdings,
            accounting for 6 percent and 5.8 percent of its investments,
            respectively. The firm also boosted its ownership of industrial
            and energy shares, while trimming holdings of consumer
            discretionary and staples stocks. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sugar at Lowest Since 2010 as Goldman Cuts Estimate; Cocoa Drops</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sugar fell to the lowest level since
            2010 in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its price
            forecasts, citing improved weather in leading producer Brazil in
            the second half of last month. Cocoa retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw sugar will be 17.5 cents a pound on the ICE Futures
            U.S. exchange in three and six months, the bank said in a report
            e-mailed today. That's down from a previous forecast of 18.5
            cents. Sugar may fall to 15 cents to 16.5 cents, Omar al-Dahhan,
            a senior trader at Louis Dreyfus Commodities, said at a
            conference in Geneva on April 18. Kona Haque, an analyst at
            Macquarie Group Ltd., said at the same event it could decline to
            as low as 16.5 cents by the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sugar production in Brazil's center south, the main growing
            region, surged to 1.45 million metric tons in the second half of
            April from 393,200 tons a year earlier, according to data from
            industry group Unica. Dry weather allowed harvesting to advance
            after rains delayed the start of the season. Production for the
            whole season will be a record 35.5 million tons, Unica said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While wet weather in April delayed the beginning of the
            Brazilian center south harvest, the sugar cane crush is
            expected' to be a record, Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin wrote in the report. 'With weather
            improving in the
            second half of April, we are lowering our three- and six-months
            price forecast.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Raw sugar for delivery in July fell as much as 0.5 percent
            to 16.94 cents a pound on ICE, the lowest for a most-active
            contract since July 2010. The price was down 0.1 percent at
            17.01 cents a pound at 6:21 a.m. Futures trading volumes were 10
            percent higher than the average for the past 100 days for this
            time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. White, or
            refined, sugar for delivery in August was down 0.3 percent to
            $476.60 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Brazil Production &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sugar prices fell 13 percent in New York this year as
            supplies are set to outpace demand. Record production in Brazil
            will probably mean a third year of surplus in the 2013-14
            season, Goldman Sachs said. The International Sugar Organization
            estimates a surplus of 8.5 million tons in 2012-13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thailand, the second-biggest sugar shipper, rejected 20
            bids to sell 72,000 tons of sugar at an auction today. All bids
            were rejected as the premium buyers were willing to pay were
            below expectations, Surat Thadachawasakul, general manager of
            state-owned Thai Cane Sugar Corp., said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cocoa for July delivery slid 0.6 percent to $2,339 a ton in
            New York. Cocoa for delivery in July fell 0.6 percent to 1,558
            pounds ($2,370) a ton in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee futures for July delivery were little
            changed at $1.4405 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee futures for
            July delivery gained 0.2 percent to $2,054 a ton in London. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Krawcheck to Acquire 85 Broads From Ex-Goldman Executive</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sallie Krawcheck, the former senior
            executive at Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. (C), agreed to
            buy 85 Broads, the global network with 30,000 members that
            promotes women as business leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Krawcheck is buying the firm from founder Janet Hanson, a
            former executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to a
            statement on the 85 Broads website. Hanson will keep a stake and
            become chairman emeritus, according to the statement, which
            didn't disclose terms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal puts Krawcheck at the head of her own company
            after stints in the top ranks of the nation's biggest lenders.
            Since then, Krawcheck has turned the spotlight on research that
            shows increased participation by women improves shareholder
            returns and helps the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of
            being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too
            much about it would hold me back in some way,' Krawcheck wrote
            on her LinkedIn page. 'But I've been thinking about it over the
            past year ... a lot.' Krawcheck said 'the research and
            business case for the economic advancement of women is so
            compelling, in a world deeply in need of greater economic
            prosperity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bigger Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;85 Broads, which began on Wall Street and expanded to
            colleges and universities, arranges networking events for
            professionals and students, often featuring women with leading
            roles in their fields. It operates more than 40 regional
            chapters and campus clubs in at least 130 countries, according
            to its website. The name is derived from the address of Goldman
            Sachs's former New York City headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nickel's Roller-Coaster Plunge Isn't Over, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel's roller-coaster ride this
            year isn't over, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            expects the highest prices in two years to prompt expanded
            capacity for smelting and discourage purchases by steelmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices plunged 11 percent the previous two days, and
            probably will fall 15 percent further in 12 months to $16,000 a
            metric ton, Goldman forecasts. Nickel had surged this year
            following a January ban on ore exports by Indonesia, the world's
            largest supplier from mines, and as threats increased for
            economic sanctions against Russia, home to OAO GMK Norilsk
            Nickel, the biggest producer of refined metal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead, exchange-tracked inventories rose, prompting some
            investors to judge the rally was exaggerated. China will
            'aggressively' build blast-furnace capacity in Indonesia to
            produce nickel pig iron, a low-grade alternative to refined
            metal, Goldman said in a report dated May 14 and e-mailed
            yesterday. Waning demand for the metal from makers of stainless
            steel is another 'downside risk' for prices, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'High prices will incentivize a substantial build out of
            blast furnace and other smelting capacity in Indonesia,'
            Goldman analysts Roger Yuan, Max Layton and Jeffrey Currie wrote
            in the report. 'Demand destruction could also help to balance
            the global market in 2015 if the ban is not relaxed during the
            smelter construction period.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel for delivery in three months on the London Metal
            Exchange rose 0.7 percent to $18,888 at 12:36 p.m. in Tokyo,
            trimming its weekly drop to 5.1 percent, the biggest such loss
            since February 2013. On May 13, the price reached $21,625, the
            highest since February 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Processing Plants &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With construction taking about 12 months, the effects of
            'de-bottlenecking' will be seen in mid-2015, the Goldman
            analysts wrote. Nine nickel-processing plants may be completed
            this year in Indonesia, and as many as 40 more by 2017,
            according to the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry. The
            country imposed the ban in a bid to transform the mineral
            industry away from raw-ore sales into higher-value processed
            products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year's rally could shrink profits in the stainless
            steel industry, encouraging substitution, Goldman said. A 5
            percent substitution would be equal to a reduction of as much as
            150,000 tons of nickel demand, the bank estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Goldman expects prices to fall in 12 months, the bank
            predicts a gain to $22,000 in three months and six months, as
            the risk from demand destruction is in the 'medium term,' the
            analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Steel Products &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stainless-steel products are made with certain
            specifications that can't be altered, making it impossible to
            replace nickel in the mix, Jason Martineau, the national sales
            manager at Penn Stainless Steel Products Inc. in Quakertown,
            Pennsylvania, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nickel's open interest, or the number of contracts yet to
            be closed, liquidated or delivered, has surged for five straight
            months to a record 319,422. The jump is 'reflecting the extreme
            nature of change that the nickel market is facing with the
            Indonesian export ban,' David Wilson, an analyst at Citigroup
            Inc. in London, said in a telephone interview this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices may top $30,000 in 2015, according to Citigroup,
            which last year correctly predicted that Indonesia would
            implement the export ban. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;China Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese stainless-steel demand is weak and few expect a
            recovery in prices until next year, Credit Suisse Group AG said
            in a report today. Most producers lost money in the first
            quarter, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The price gap between locally produced nickel in China and
            LME futures narrowed this week, indicating that further
            increases in imports of the refined metal are likely, according
            to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S. and Europe threatened more sanctions after
            Vladimir Putin's incursion into Ukraine and the international
            condemnation that followed, it didn't put a dent in Russia's
            exports of raw materials. The country exported 51,600 tons of
            nickel in the first quarter, similar to the same period last
            year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The plunge 'illustrates the extent to which speculation
            was apparently responsible for driving up the nickel price,'
            Daniel Briesemann, an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt,
            said in a report. 'The correction process could well continue
            for the time being.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copper in London was little changed at $6,878 a ton,
            heading for a second weekly gain. The contract for delivery in
            July on the Comex in New York was little changed at $3.146 a
            pound. In Shanghai, futures for delivery in August slid 0.6
            percent to 48,390 yuan ($7,765) a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On the LME, zinc climbed, while lead and tin dropped.
            Aluminum was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Finance $500 Million for SolarCity Roofs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; SolarCity Corp. (SCTY), a solar-energy
            developer chaired by billionaire Elon Musk, won financing from
            Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. for more than $500 million in rooftop
            solar systems that the company will complete this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lease-financing agreement will help SolarCity build
            about 110 megawatts of solar power systems with little or no up-front cost for homeowners and businesses,
            San Mateo, California-based SolarCity said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal is the largest single financing agreement for
            rooftop systems in the U.S. and will raise awareness of the
            quality of the solar-lease asset class, SolarCity Chief
            Executive Officer Lyndon Rive said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We hope it sends a signal that solar is a stable and
            reliable asset to invest in,' Rive said in an interview.
            'These aren't luxury yachts we're talking about, it's your
            energy, and the default rates are lower than mortgages.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the first quarter, SolarCity said it invested $138.2
            million in solar systems as demand for rooftop panels from
            homeowners and businesses surged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For New York-based Goldman Sachs, the SolarCity agreement
            will help reach the Wall Street bank's goal of financing $40
            billion in renewable energy during the next decade, said Stuart Bernstein, global head of clean technology.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'SolarCity's range of distributed solar solutions
            targeting a wider customer base will help us move toward a low
            carbon energy future,' Bernstein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The financing agreement also allows SolarCity to extend
            credit to homeowners with lower credit scores, Rive said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When we started you needed a FICO score of 720 or
            higher,' Rive said. 'Now it's more like 680 and I suspect in
            the near term we'll be at 650.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SolarCity climbed 11 percent to $35.69 at the close in New
            York. The shares have quadrupled since the initial offering in
            December. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Tax Deal Didn't Break U.K. Law, Judge Rules</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s deal with
            the U.K. government that may have saved the investment bank as
            much as 20 million pounds ($30.6 million) on its taxes didn't
            break any laws, a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her Majesty's Revenue Customs's decision to reduce the
            New York-based bank's tax bill was properly conducted, a judge
            in London ruled today. Still, Judge Andrew Nicol criticized tax
            officials who considered the potential embarrassment to
            Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne if a deal with
            Goldman Sachs wasn't completed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The settlement with Goldman Sachs was not a glorious
            episode in the history of the Revenue,' Nicol said in his
            written ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-avoidance schemes following widespread media
            and public anger
            caused by the amount of corporation tax the likes of Google
            Inc., Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) and Amazon.com Inc. pay in the country.
            Lawmakers said in a report last month that increased
            transparency about companies' tax affairs would build pressure
            on multinational businesses to 'pay a fair share.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action, an advocacy group that lobbies for
            alternatives to government spending cuts, said HMRC reached the
            agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne announced a
            bankers' code to counter tax avoidance. An HMRC executive said
            in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was concerned the bank
            might drop out of the code if the deal was scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sees Large-Scale ECB Bond Buying of Limited Effect</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank is unlikely
            to begin large-scale asset purchases to stimulate inflation and
            such a plan would have limited effect as nations' borrowing
            costs are already low, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We doubt that a large-scale asset-purchase program would
            have a meaningful impact on yields,' Goldman Sachs analysts,
            including London-based chief European economist Huw Pill, wrote
            in a client report. 'With rates at such low levels, it is
            unclear how attractive euro-area government yields will look for
            investors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ECB President Mario Draghi said on May 8 that the Governing
            Council was ready to act at its meeting next month to boost the
            currency bloc's economy. He had previously indicated stimulus
            measures being considered included quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With a rally in the region's sovereign bonds leaving
            borrowing costs in the most-indebted nations near record lows,
            'the likelihood of a large-scale asset-purchase program remains
            small,' the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in the report, dated
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds was at 2.95 percent as
            of 2:52 p.m. London time after falling to 2.83 percent
            yesterday, the least since Bloomberg began collecting the data
            in 1993. The rates on similar maturity Italian debt were at 3.05
            percent, from a euro-era low of 2.89 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer prices in the euro area rose an annualized 0.7
            percent in April, below half the central bank's goal of just
            under 2 percent for a seventh month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Expansion Beyond N.Y. Leads Shareholders to Texas</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has expanded
            its workforce outside New York and San Francisco mainly to cut
            costs. Its office in Irving, Texas, also aims to boost revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The office, among the firm's largest in the nation with
            about 650 employees, hosted the investment bank's annual
            shareholders meeting today with Texas Governor Rick Perry giving
            a speech. In addition to typical back-office functions such as
            accounting and information security, the location houses a
            commercial real estate lending group and is the headquarters for
            the realty-management division. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That group is the descendant of a joint venture named
            Archon that Goldman Sachs set up in 1991 with J.E. Robert Cos.
            to buy distressed assets from the Resolution Trust Corp. after
            the savings and loan crisis. The division, led by partner Tom Dowling, now sources deals and manages real
            estate investments
            for the bank's special-situations group and property funds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the division doesn't have its own balance sheet, and
            instead aids deals by the firm's revenue-producing units, it
            deployed about $7 billion in loans and investments last year,
            according to a person with knowledge of its operations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired all of Archon in 2000, and the
            business operated as an independent subsidiary for years. It
            purchased more than $1 billion of property in the U.S. in some
            years, mostly for the bank's Whitehall real estate funds,
            according to a former employee. That activity dropped as the
            U.S. property market plunged, and the last Whitehall fund was
            raised in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dallas, Bangalore &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Irving, in Dallas's shadow with a population of about
            225,500, is home to businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the
            world's second most valuable company, and CEC Entertainment
            Inc., owner of the Chuck E. Cheese pizza chain. Goldman Sachs
            also has an office in Dallas with several private wealth
            management advisers and one investment banker, managing director
            Peter Brundage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in
            November that a quarter of the firm's employees were located
            near Dallas, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Bangalore, India.
            That's increased from 10 percent in 2007 as the bank looks to
            cut expenses, he said. The firm hosted its annual meeting in
            Salt Lake City last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pay Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shareholders elected all of the firm's nominees for the
            board of directors, General Counsel Greg Palm said today,
            announcing a preliminary count of the votes. About 83 percent of
            votes approved the bank's executive pay plan, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like Morgan Stanley's annual meeting earlier this week,
            today's gathering featured no questions from shareholders and
            lasted fewer than 40 minutes. About half the meeting was taken
            up by Perry's speech, which extolled the benefits of companies
            moving to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein thanked Perry for his support of Goldman Sachs's
            businesses in the state. The CEO didn't accept a shareholder's
            invitation to move the firm's headquarters to Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think there's a lot of compelling reasons to move to
            Texas and a lot of compelling reasons to stay where we are,
            including Newton's first law of inertia,' Blankfein said in an
            interview after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beyond the meeting, Goldman Sachs is trying to cement ties
            to the area. Dina H. Powell, a partner who leads the firm's
            charitable efforts, announced this week the start of the bank's
            10,000 Small Businesses education and funding program in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Platts, AMD Trade Secrets, Goldman Sachs: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Traders are standing by Platts, the
            company that provides benchmark prices for much of the world's
            energy products, amid a European probe into market manipulation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A total of 34 out of 55 traders, brokers and analysts
            surveyed by Bloomberg News May 15, or 62 percent, said the
            pricing system run by Platts, the energy news and data unit of
            McGraw Hill Financial Inc., is still the best way to determine
            prices in the $3.4 trillion-a-year market for crude and refined
            products. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), BP Plc (BP/) and Statoil ASA (STL) said
            they're also being investigated by the European Commission
            following raids in three countries May 14 while Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V)
            said yesterday it was asked to provide information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As much as 80 percent of all crude and oil-product deals
            are linked to reference prices including those published by
            Platts, according to estimates by Total SA (FP), Europe's third-biggest producer. The European investigation
            marks the third
            time global pricing benchmarks have drawn regulators' scrutiny
            in the past year following inquiries into bank manipulation of
            the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and ISDAFix, the
            benchmark for the $379 trillion swaps market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European regulators didn't name the subjects of their probe
            and haven't specified the markets they are investigating or the
            methods in question. 'Companies may have colluded in reporting
            distorted prices to a Price Reporting Agency to manipulate the
            published prices for a number of oil and biofuel products,'
            according to a May 14 statement by the EC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kathleen Tanzy, a Houston-based spokeswoman for Platts,
            said on May 13 that the EC had undertaken a review at its office
            in London in relation to its price assessment process. In a
            submission to a 2012 report by the International Organization of
            Security Commissions on oil pricing regulation, the company said
            external controls over its activities would be an 'unacceptable
            intrusion' on its rights as a publisher. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Platts's North Sea Dated Brent benchmark sets the price of
            half the world's crude, from Canada to Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
            Platts and other companies in providing energy markets news and
            information. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;SEC's White Rebuffs Call to Forswear Political Spending Rule &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White
            rebuffed calls by House Republicans to forswear a rule that
            would force public companies to disclose political spending,
            saying she won't 'prejudge the issue.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Responding to lawmakers who pressed her on the matter at a
            Financial Services subcommittee oversight hearing yesterday,
            White said the SEC's staff is reviewing a 2011 petition for such
            a rule signed by a group of prominent law professors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She said no one is currently working on a proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agency's rulemaking agenda indicates it is studying
            whether to propose a rule. Republicans urged White to swear off
            any action on the issue, calling it a partisan undertaking that
            would hurt the SEC's credibility as a regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Debate over corporate political spending gained attention
            after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 2010 case known as
            Citizens United that companies and unions could spend unlimited
            money on election ads. More than 500,000 comments have been
            filed in response to the petition, which is supported by the
            Council of Institutional Investors and the American Federation
            of State, County and Municipal Employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other large business
            groups oppose the call for a rule. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rulemaking on the issue has been criticized as tied to
            partisan political agendas and a distraction from SEC mandates
            of protecting investors, maintaining efficient markets, and
            facilitating capital formation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, White told the panel that any proposed changes
            relating to money market mutual funds would 'seek to preserve
            the many benefits of money market funds for investors and the
            short-term funding markets,' according to remarks prepared for
            the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rule simultaneously would seek to reduce money-market
            funds' 'susceptibility to runs, improving their ability to
            manage and mitigate potential contagion from high levels of
            redemptions, and increasing the transparency of their risks,'
            she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last month, White said the SEC is the best regulatory
            agency to handle the money market rule changes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BlackRock Develops Alternatives to Money Funds as Rules Loom &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Western Asset Management Co. are
            offering a new twist on traditional money-market funds as
            regulators are set to impose sweeping changes on the $2.58
            trillion industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager, and Legg
            Mason Inc. (LM)'s Western Asset unit have started bond funds designed
            to work much like money funds, with a difference. The new
            'ultra-short' funds have share prices that fluctuate along
            with the value of their holdings, rather than a fixed net asset
            value, or NAV, a distinguishing feature of money funds. They
            also have shorter maturities than similar ultra-short bond funds
            that ran into trouble when credit markets froze in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firms are preparing for what could be a seismic
            reallocation of assets by institutional investors and corporate
            treasurers if regulators overhaul money funds for a second time
            in three years in a bid to make them safer after the 2008
            collapse of the Reserve Primary Fund. The U.S. Securities and
            Exchange Commission plans to order a floating NAV on
            institutional prime money-market funds, or those that invest in
            corporate debt, overriding opposition from the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mary Athridge, a spokeswoman for Baltimore-based Legg
            Mason, declined to comment on the Western Asset Ultra Short
            Obligations Fund, which the firm filed to register on May 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new ultra-short fund is 'clearly' not a money-market
            fund, though at first glance it may 'look similar' to one,
            said Richard Hoerner, head of New York-based BlackRock's global
            cash-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock opened the BlackRock Ultra-Short Obligations Fund (BBUSX)
            in November and it has about $25 million of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal regulators have been searching for ways to prevent
            a replay of September 2008. In 2010, the SEC tightened rules on
            credit quality, shortened the maximum average maturity for funds
            and introduced minimum liquidity levels. The agency considered
            it an initial step toward making money funds more stable. The
            industry fought back against proposals and sought to limit the
            scope of changes. The SEC is now planning a narrower proposal. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-AMD Workers at Nvidia Barred From Revealing Trade Secrets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) won a court order barring ex-employees who went to competing
            chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) from
            disclosing trade secrets or soliciting former colleagues to join
            them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman said in his order that
            AMD may win its lawsuit claiming misappropriation of
            confidential information, according to a filing May 15 in
            Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AMD, based in Sunnyvale, California, accused ex-employees
            of taking sensitive company documents when they went to work for
            Nvidia. The former employees transferred more than 100,000
            electronic files pertaining to AMD's graphics-processor business
            in the days before their departure, AMD said in its complaint
            filed in January. The employees also allegedly recruited other
            AMD workers to leave the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The order, called a preliminary injunction, replaces a
            temporary restraining order granted after the suit was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, isn't a defendant
            in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Advanced Micro Devices v. Feldstein, 13-cv-40007, U.S. District Court, District of
            Massachusetts
            (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Tax Deal Didn't Break U.K. Law, Judge Rules &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s deal with the U.K. government
            that may have saved the investment bank as much as 20 million
            pounds ($30.6 million) on its taxes didn't break any laws, a
            judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Her Majesty's Revenue Customs's decision to reduce the
            New York-based bank's tax bill was properly conducted, a judge
            in London ruled yesterday. Still, Judge Andrew Nicol criticized
            tax officials who considered the potential embarrassment to
            Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne if a deal with
            Goldman Sachs wasn't completed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government has pledged to clamp down on tax-avoidance schemes following widespread media
            and public anger
            caused by corporation tax structures in the country. Lawmakers
            said in a report last month that increased transparency about
            companies' tax affairs would build pressure on multinational
            businesses to 'pay a fair share.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UK Uncut Legal Action, an advocacy group that lobbies for
            alternatives to government spending cuts, said HMRC reached the
            agreement with Goldman Sachs on the day Osborne announced a
            bankers' code to counter tax avoidance. An HMRC executive said
            in an e-mail cited by UK Uncut that he was concerned the bank
            might drop out of the code if the deal was scuttled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Obviously while we are deeply disappointed that this deal
            has not been declared unlawful, the judge's ruling that top HMRC
            officials played politics with major tax deals to protect
            Osborne's reputation is a major victory in exposing the truth
            behind these secret deals,' Anna Walker, campaigns director of
            UK Uncut Legal Action, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs wasn't involved in the litigation. Fiona
            Laffan, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
            to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is a judicial review, a legal mechanism that
            examines the decision-making process of public bodies. While an
            authority may be ordered to reconsider an action, it may be
            allowed to draw the same conclusion provided all procedures are
            correctly followed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Eyes Japan Renewable Energy Investments</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
            invest as much as 50 billion yen ($487 million) in renewable
            energy projects in Japan in the next five years, tapping demand
            for electricity produced from solar and wind-power generators. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm also plans to take as much as 250
            billion yen of bank loans and project-financing over the same
            period to move ahead with projects that would cost a total of
            300 billion yen, Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for
            Goldman, said by telephone. The Nikkei newspaper reported the
            plan earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan began offering incentives in July through feed-in
            tariffs to encourage renewables after the Fukushima nuclear-plant crisis stemming from the March 11, 2011
            earthquake and
            tsunami. Japan has been forced to slash its reliance on atomic
            power generation since Fukushima. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe that we can leverage our global expertise in
            investing in renewable energy in places such as the U.S. and
            India, to help expand Japan's renewable power capabilities,'
            Ankur Sahu, co-head of the merchant banking division in the
            Asia-Pacific, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs formed the Japan Renewable Energy Co. unit in
            August to plan, design and operate power plants run on sun,
            wind, fuel cells and biomass fuels, it said on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investor Attraction &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy has attracted interest from investors
            ranging from billionaire Masayoshi Son's Softbank Corp. (9984) and
            financial-services company Orix Corp. (8591) to the country's biggest
            banks led by Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Japan will probably become the largest solar market in the
            world after China this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commercial and utility-scale projects will boost solar
            installations to a range of 6.1 gigawatts to 9.4 gigawatts in
            2013, exceeding an earlier forecast of 3.2 gigawatts to 4
            gigawatts, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies that stand to benefit include Kyocera Corp. (6971),
            Sharp Corp. and Suntech Power Japan Corp., all of which make and
            sell solar panels for residential and industrial use. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.K. Water M&amp;amp;A Boosted by Lower Financing Rates, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The falling cost of financing U.K.
            water assets may boost merger activity in the industry even amid
            a regulatory price review, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The MA interest in the U.K. water sector reflects the
            low cost of finance for regulated assets despite a regulatory
            tariff reset next year' by Ofwat, Goldman Sachs analysts Andrew Mead and Fred Barasi wrote in a May 17 note
            to clients, citing
            declines in yields of U.K. government bonds this year that are
            index-linked. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Part of the attraction in U.K. utilities stems from a
            decline in real interest rates, with index-linked gilt yields
            from the U.K. government bonds now in negative levels, Goldman
            Sachs wrote, adding that real interest rates are expected to be
            negative for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Goldman note came after Severn Trent Plc (SVT), the U.K.'s
            second-largest publicly traded water utility, rejected a
            possible takeover approach last week from Kuwait Investment
            Office, Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc. and Britain's
            Universities Superannuation Scheme, saying it undervalued the
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Severn Trent shares have risen 12 percent in the past week
            compared with 5.3 percent by the U.K.'s biggest publicly traded
            water company, United Utilities Group Plc (UU/), and 7.5 percent by
            Pennon Group Plc (PNN), the U.K.'s third-largest water utility. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Severn approach occurred at a time when Ofwat is
            consulting on prices that water and sewerage companies must
            deliver for the years 2015 to 2020, with final prices to be
            published next year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Telecom Italia Brazil Towers Said to Attract Goldman Firm</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-backed
            company and American Tower Corp. (AMT) are among those seeking to buy
            Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)'s mobile-phone towers in Brazil, according to
            people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's Cell Site Solutions Cessao de Infraestruturas SA
            and American Tower are among potential buyers that have sent
            letters of interest to the Italian carrier, said the people,
            asking not to be named because the talks are private. Telecom
            Italia, which is working with Morgan Stanley to sell the assets,
            values them at about 750 million euros ($1 billion), one of the
            people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazilian mobile carriers are farming out the ownership and
            maintenance of towers, then leasing space on them, to focus on
            adding network capacity as demand for wireless Internet access
            increases. Telecom Italia, which is selling about 6,000 towers
            in Brazil, has also disposed of other assets and scrapped
            dividends to cut debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Wireless-tower divestitures are a necessary tactic for
            all phone carriers, which need to recover cash and focus
            investments on stronger fiber, fixed-line networks,' said
            Massimiliano Trovato, a media and telecommunications analyst at
            Bruno Leoni Institute, an economic think tank. 'This move makes
            even more sense for Telecom Italia since I remain convinced the
            Italian operator sooner or later will exit the Brazilian market,
            and this is a potential first step in that direction.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Expanding Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Telecom Italia, based in Milan, said last week it expects
            non-binding offers for the Brazil towers by the end of May. The
            company owns a total of about 8,500 towers through its Tim
            Participacoes SA (TIMP3) unit. Tim Chief Executive Officer Rodrigo Abreu
            said the tower sale process is ongoing, and there aren't plans
            to sell the company itself. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is no offer of any kind to buy Tim,' Abreu said to
            reporters in Brasilia today. 'There has been no solicitation
            and there are no negotiations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman and JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Gavea Investimentos
            Ltda., the Brazilian hedge-fund firm founded by former central
            bank president Arminio Fraga, unveiled tower-investment company
            Cell Site Solutions last year. Tower companies such as SBA
            Communications Corp. (SBAC) and Boston-based American Tower have also
            been expanding in the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives of Telecom Italia, Cell Site Solutions,
            American Tower and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Telecom Italia shares fell 1.6 percent to 84 cents at the
            close in Milan, giving the company a market value of 15.2
            billion euros. The shares briefly recovered their losses after
            Bloomberg's report on the interest in the towers before
            declining again. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Towers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SBA, based in Boca Raton, Florida, agreed in December to
            pay 1.53 billion reais ($693 million) for 2,007 Oi SA towers, or
            about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than twice the price it
            paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi towers, according to
            Wells Fargo Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'SBA would be interested in evaluating the potential to
            increase its Brazilian portfolio through additional MA,' the
            company said in an e-mailed response to questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Additional capacity is also needed as demand for mobile
            services soars, with one tower builder estimating that 6,680 new
            units are required this year alone. Goldman, Patria
            Investimentos SA -- a firm that includes Blackstone Group LP
            among its investors -- and at least six other private-equity
            firms are backing five local tower builders to benefit from the
            rising demand. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it has
            begun the process to sell Metro International Trade Services
            LLC, the metals warehouse business purchased by the bank in
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Metro is not strategic to our client activities, and the
            firm has concluded that this is the right time to explore a
            sale, given recent interest by potential buyers,' Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said in an
            e-mailed
            statement today. 'A formal sales process has begun.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc, JPMorgan Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley are
            scaling back their raw-material businesses. Commodity revenue at
            the 10 largest banks fell 18 percent last year amid reduced
            volatility, Coalition, a London-based analytics company, said in
            February. Regulators are concerned that lenders might be able to
            wield control over prices, or suffer losses that would endanger
            the financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
            posted its worst year in five in 2013 as gold fell the most
            since 1981 and corn, arabica coffee and wheat slid at least 20
            percent. Commodity-related assets under management shrank by
            about $100 billion, or about 25 percent of the total held at the
            year's start, Barclays estimated in February. The GSCI index
            rose 3.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman received inquiries from potential buyers in
            November after the London Metal Exchange proposed new rules on
            how storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter
            said at the time. The LME postponed implementation after the
            plan, intended to ease aluminum bottlenecks at warehouses, was
            tossed out by a judge. This month, the LME was granted
            permission to appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumers of metals including brewer MillerCoors LLC
            complained that lengthy waits for stockpiled supplies inflated
            costs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. LNG Export Potential Gaining Momentum, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Liquefied natural gas exports from
            the U.S. are looking more likely after the Freeport LNG terminal
            got conditional approval from the Department of Energy, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Freeport LNG Development LP's project in Texas was the
            second facility to receive approval from the Energy Department
            to send gas to countries that don't have free-trade agreements
            with the U.S. The terminal would be able to export 1.4 billion
            cubic feet a day. The development, partly owned by
            ConocoPhillips (COP), Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Osaka Gas Co. (9532), still needs
            approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These recent developments support our view that at least
            6.8 billion cubic feet a day of liquefaction of capacity will be
            built in the U.S.,' Goldman Sachs analysts led by London-based
            Samantha Dart said in a report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market doesn't need more than 7.7 billion cubic feet a
            day of U.S. LNG for the next decade based on the bank's demand
            forecasts, according to the note. Gas prices at the Henry Hub in
            Erath, Louisiana, need to stay at or below $5.10 per million
            British thermal units to keep U.S. LNG competitive in Europe,
            Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contract for June delivery rose as much as 0.4 percent
            to $4.108 per million Btu in electronic trading today on the New
            York Mercantile Exchange. Futures rose 0.9 percent to close at
            $4.09 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Assuming a normalized oil price of $100 a barrel, U.S.
            gas would likely be cheaper than oil-indexed contracted
            deliveries in Asia for Henry Hub prices at $6.60 per million
            Btu,' Dart said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cheniere Energy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. conditionally approved Cheniere Energy Inc.'s (LNG)
            Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana in May 2011 for exports of
            as much as 2.2 billion cubic feet a day. The government has
            weighed 20 applications for export terminals in recent months,
            which could ship the equivalent of 41 percent of U.S. total
            production this year, Energy Department data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. may export 6.5 billion to 8.5 billion cubic feet a
            day of gas by 2020, Adam Longson, an analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS)
            in New York, said in an e-mailed report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Energy Department 'will only need to approve two more
            projects by early- to mid-2016 in order for U.S. LNG exports to
            reach the low end of our estimates,' Longson said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Henry Hub gas prices will average $3.80 per million Btu
            this year, higher than the previous estimate of $3.52, the
            Energy Information Administration said May 7 in its monthly
            Short-Term Energy Outlook. The average may slump to $3.77 in the
            third quarter before climbing to $3.92 during the final three
            months of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>S&amp;amp;P 500 May Reach 2,100, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
            U.S. stock-market rally may last at least another 2 1/2 years,
            sending the Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) up 26 percent to 2,100. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Kostin, the bank's New York-based chief U.S. equity
            strategist, raised forecasts for the U.S. equity benchmark,
            predicting it will finish 2013 at 1,750 and 2014 at 1,900 as
            stock valuations increase, according to a research report dated
            yesterday. The SP 500 trades at 16.3 times reported operating
            profit, 16 percent below the average since 1998, data compiled
            by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our positive 2013 outlook for SP 500 has played out much
            faster than we expected,' Kostin wrote. 'Reasons for a higher
            multiple include increased confidence in the medium-term outlook
            for U.S. economic growth, improving investor risk appetite and
            the wide gap between equity and bond yields that we now assume
            will be closed more by stocks than bonds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's increase comes after Thomas Lee, JPMorgan
            Chase Co.'s chief U.S. equity strategist, lifted his estimate
            to 1,715 from 1,580 last week. The SP 500 has surged 17 percent
            in 2013 as companies beat earnings estimates and the Federal
            Reserve continued its unprecedented bond-buying program known as
            quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The equity benchmark gained 0.2 percent to 1,669.16 at 4
            p.m. New York time today. The index has rallied 128 days without
            a retreat exceeding 5 percent or more, the longest stretch since
            the 173 days ending Feb. 20, 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dividend Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP 500 companies from Apple Inc. to Clorox Co. raised
            dividends this year, giving the index a higher dividend increase
            than earnings expansion for the first quarter, according to
            Kostin. Dividends will rise 30 percent by 2015, with an 11
            percent increase this year, adding about 150 points to the SP
            500, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Dividend growth has been pretty robust,' Kostin said in
            a phone interview today. 'A lot of companies with these super
            high margins are distributing more cash to shareholders with
            high dividends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Excess Returns &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks are poised to gain during the next five years
            thanks to record-low interest rates on government bonds,
            according to researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New
            York. A survey of 29 models for the equity risk premium -- the
            expected future return of stocks over the risk-free rate offered
            by Treasuries -- shows 'we will enjoy historically high excess
            returns for the SP 500,' Fed economists Fernando Duarte and
            Carlo Rosa said in a paper released on May 8. The premium rose
            to a record 5.4 percent in December, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 added 2.1 percent last week, its fourth
            straight weekly gain, as gauges of leading economic indicators
            and consumer sentiment beat estimates. The U.S. bull market has
            entered its fifth year, adding about $11.5 trillion in market
            value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's certainly been a substantial and powerful move in
            equity prices in a short period of time, there's no question,'
            Kostin said today. 'This year, basically all that market move
            has been valuation-driven,' he said. 'The economy's re-accelerating from a multi-year period of stagnation
            to an above-trend growth rate, and that would be consistent with P/E
            expansion.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Merck to Buy Back $5 Billion of Its Shares From Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Merck Co. (MRK), the second-biggest U.S.
            drugmaker, reached a deal to repurchase $5 billion of its shares
            from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as part of a buyback program
            announced earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck will make an initial purchase of 99.5 million shares
            based on current market prices, according to a statement today
            from the Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based company. The
            transaction is expected to be completed by Nov. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck, facing generic competition to what was once its
            best-selling drug, earlier this month cut its full-year guidance
            in anticipation of lower sales and said it would buy back as
            much as $15 billion in shares. The move is a good use of cash
            and may help appease investors who have lost 22 percent of their
            value in the stock over the past six years, said Bill Smead,
            chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The stock has been down so long,' Smead, whose firm owns
            shares, said in a telephone interview. 'There is nothing else
            to do with the cash if you are already expensing your RD and
            already paying a good dividend. If you have extra cash there is
            really nothing to do with that than a share buyback unless you
            are going to make an acquisition.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck sold bonds last week to fund some of the share
            repurchases, which the company had said were to reach about $7.5
            billion over 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This accelerated share repurchase demonstrates our
            commitment to delivering increased value to shareholders in the
            short term, while continuing to invest in the important
            opportunities that will drive our long-term growth,' Merck
            Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck rose 4.7 percent to $47.33 at the close in New York
            time prior to the announcement. The drugmaker has gained 26
            percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck has been struggling to boost profit since its once
            top-selling asthma medicine Singulair began facing generic
            competition in August and research setbacks have delayed new
            products. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Seek ICBC Exit With $1.1 Billion Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ended a
            seven-year investment in Industrial Commercial Bank of China
            Ltd. by selling a $1.1 billion stake in the world's largest
            lender by market value, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank sold 1.58 billion shares in ICBC at HK$5.50
            each, the person said, asking not to be identified as the
            information is private. That's a 2.5 percent discount to ICBC's
            closing price yesterday in Hong Kong trading. The Beijing-based
            bank closed 2.1 percent lower at HK$5.52 today, paring its gain
            for the past year to 19 percent. Singapore's state-owned Temasek
            Holdings Private Ltd. bought 280 million ICBC shares, increasing
            its stake to 7.04 percent, according to disclosures posted the
            Hong Kong stock exchange website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm joins Citigroup Inc. (C) and Bank of
            America Corp. in cutting holdings in China as new capital rules
            known as Basel III make it more expensive to hold minority
            stakes in banks. Goldman Sachs has reaped about $12 billion in
            sales proceeds and dividends from its $2.58 billion investment
            in ICBC, calculations by Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Many foreign banks are facing capital shortages with the
            new Basel requirement, so I'm not surprised that they dumped
            holdings in Chinese banks on which they've already made massive
            returns,' said Chen Xingyu, a Shanghai-based analyst at Phillip
            Securities Group. 'The exit strategy has been on the table for
            these foreign investors since the very beginning because they
            know these aren't real strategic investments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and client funds offloaded ICBC shares at
            least five times before the latest transaction after first
            investing in ICBC in 2006. Connie Ling, a spokeswoman for New
            York-based Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, declined to comment today
            on the latest sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Capital Deductions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New rules set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
            require punitive capital deductions for holding minority
            investments in other financial institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' Tier 1 common ratio was about 12.7 percent
            under Basel I and an estimated 9 percent under Basel III, Chief
            Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup sold its entire stake in Shanghai Pudong
            Development Bank in March 2012, nine years after buying it, for
            an after-tax gain of $349 million. Bank of America sold 10.4
            billion shares of China Construction Bank Corp. in November 2011
            for a profit of about $1.8 billion, its fourth sale, leaving it
            with a 1 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICBC last month reported a 12 percent increase in first-quarter profit, defying a sluggish domestic
            economy to boost
            lending. The world's most profitable lender extended 461 billion
            yuan ($75 billion) of new loans in the first quarter, 25 percent
            more than in the same period a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Low Valuations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank and its closest local rivals are trading near
            record-low valuations on concern that profit growth may slow as
            loans sour and the government deregulates interest rates. ICBC
            trades at about six times estimated 2013 earnings, down from a
            high of 21 times in early 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's good timing for Goldman to sell its stake in ICBC,'
            said Rainy Yuan, an analyst in Shanghai at Masterlink Securities
            Corp. 'Valuations of Chinese banks will remain low as China's
            interest-rate liberalization is a long-term trend which will
            hurt lenders' profits.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-rating companies have also warned that China isn't
            reducing risks from local-government debt and credit expansion
            fast enough. China's shadow banking system -- which includes
            private lending, trust loans, and credit from non-bank
            institutions -- poses systemic risks to the nation's financial
            industry after expanding by more than 67 percent over the past
            two years, Moody's Investors Service said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Soured Loans &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese banks' nonperforming loans increased for a sixth
            straight quarter, the longest streak in at least nine years, to
            526.5 billion yuan as of March 31, regulatory data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe NPL figures greatly understate the potential
            scope of the problem of poor quality loans,' Carson Block, the
            short seller who runs Muddy Waters LLC, said in an e-mailed
            reply to queries. 'Our concerns implicate loans throughout the
            economy -- both public and private sector.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Block said this month that he's betting against the debt of
            Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), in part because an economic slowdown in
            China will lead to 'considerable stress' at the U.K. lender,
            which gets two-thirds of profit from Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global financial firms including Temasek Holdings Pte
            invested $33 billion in Chinese lenders from 2001 to 2009,
            according to the regulator. They still own at least $45 billion
            of stakes in local banks, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since acquiring the stake in ICBC in 2006, Goldman Sachs
            has recorded $3.47 billion in net gains on the position,
            according to company filings through the first quarter of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As of March, Goldman Sachs had a $1.11 billion position in
            ICBC on its own balance sheet, down from $2.08 billion at the
            end of December because of a sale in January, according to the
            firm's 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Widens Iron Ore Surplus Forecast on Steel Output</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The global seaborne iron ore glut
            will probably be 21 percent bigger than forecast next year as
            steel production slows in China, the world's largest consumer,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The surplus will reach 175 million metric tons in 2015,
            compared with a prior prediction of 145 million tons, Goldman
            Sachs said in a report dated yesterday. The bank estimates that
            output will exceed demand by 72 million tons and prices will
            average $109 a ton in 2014, before dropping to $80 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore has slumped 27 percent this year as economic
            growth in China slowed and mining companies from BHP Billiton
            Ltd. to Rio Tinto Group in Australia boosted output, shifting
            the global seaborne market into a glut. Banks from Standard
            Chartered Plc to Credit Suisse Group AG say more Chinese steel
            mills will go bankrupt and hurt consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market is no longer in balance but in the early stage
            of a structural surplus,' analysts including Christian Lelong
            wrote in the report. 'China will not act as the safety valve in
            an oversupplied market for much longer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
            port of Tianjin fell 1 percent to $97.50 a dry ton yesterday,
            the lowest level since September 2012, according to data from
            The Steel Index Ltd. The decline in iron ore, Australia's
            biggest export earner, pulled the country's dollar today to the
            weakest level since May 2. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Stockpiles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the last decline below $100 in 2012 spurred buyers to
            rebuild inventories, boosting prices to about $159 in four
            months, this time around expectations of ample supply will
            encourage users to keep reserves at a minimum, said Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We believe the current downturn could trigger another
            destocking cycle of similar scale,' Lelong, Daniel Quigley and
            Amber Cai wrote. 'But the eventual rebound will be far less
            robust than previously.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reduced Chinese imports will also offset any impact of
            expected supply disruptions in India and a possible strike at
            Australia's Port Hedland, the world's largest bulk-export
            terminal, the bank said. Maritime Union of Australia, which
            represents tugboat deckhands at the port, approved unlimited
            work stoppages of 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days on May 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BHP, the third-largest exporter, won't be able to make up
            shipments lost during a strike, the company's iron ore president
            Jimmy Wilson said in a statement today. The union said May 12 it
            hadn't decided whether to take action. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Port Strike &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Disruption in Port Hedland would be costly for the
            producers affected and would drive a temporary price rally, but
            it would ultimately be washed out by global market
            fundamentals,' Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's inventory at ports rose 1.8 percent to a record
            112.55 million tons in the week to May 16 from a week earlier,
            according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. As
            much as 40 percent of inventory at ports may be tied up in
            financing purposes, according to Daiwa Securities Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A meaningful amount of iron ore stockpiles in China is
            tied to financing, which means an unwinding can be excessive,'
            said Doug King, the London-based chief investment officer of the
            Merchant Commodity Fund, which returned 15.4 percent from
            January to April partly from iron ore. 'Real demand will be
            dampened when those stockpiles are sold into the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's economy that creates demand for 69 percent of the
            world's seaborne ore will grow by 7.3 percent this year, the
            lowest since 1990, according to a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar touched 92.16 U.S. cents today. It
            dropped 0.9 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since March 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Changes in spot iron ore prices affect the currency far
            more quickly these days,' Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange
            strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a client note dated yesterday.
            'That's largely due to the demise of annual fixed price iron
            ore contracts, and the subsequent shift to quarterly, then to
            monthly, then to spot pricing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of BHP fell 0.8 percent to A$37.17 ($34.32) at the
            close in Sydney today and Rio, the second-biggest exporter,
            declined 1.1 percent to A$59.40. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Turkiye Sise Cam Fabrikalari AS (SISE), Turkey's biggest glass-making group, is working with
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Is Yatirim Menkul Degerler AS (ISMEN) to take its glassware unit public,
            two people with knowledge of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shares of the Istanbul-based unit,
            Pasabahce Cam Sanayi Ticaret AS, may be sold late this year or early next, said the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the plans are private. Sisecam, owned by Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR), the country's
            biggest lender by assets, holds 99 percent of Pasabahce. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a public company, Pasabahce
            may be valued at about five times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a November
            report by investment firm Oyak Yatirim Ortakligi AS estimates. Oyak also estimated Pasabahce's Ebitda last
            year at 211 million liras ($114 million). The company's book value was 494 million liras at end of
            September, the latest available data, according to a research note by the Ekspres Invest brokerage house.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IPOs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa have raised $7 billion this year, about 80
            percent more than what companies sold in the same period in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the
            biggest Turkish IPO this year, low-cost carrier Pegasus Hava Tasimaciligi AS raised 650 million liras
            selling 35.3 million shares on April 22, valuing the company at 1.88 billion liras. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unlocked
            Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ekspres Invest, an Istanbul-based brokerage owned by OAO Sberbank, said Jan. 24
            that Pasabahce's IPO would positively affect other companies in the group -- including Trakya Cam, Anadolu
            Cam, Soda Sanayii (SODA) -- as 'the value of Pasabahce will be unlocked and the ownership structure will be
            more transparent.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pasabahce posted 575 million liras in net sales and 13.8 million
            liras in net income in the first nine months of 2012, according to the company's website. Sisecam shares
            gained 0.9 percent to 3.28 liras at 10:35 a.m. in Istanbul. Trakya Cam gained 2.25 percent and Anadolu Cam 1
            percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman didn't reply to e-mailed questions. An Is Yatirim
            official declined to comment. Ahmet Kirman, chief executive officer of Sisecam, didn't answer e-mailed
            questions from Bloomberg seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Hedge Funds Trail S&amp;amp;P 500 by 10 Percentage Points, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds' returns have stayed
            'lackluster' this year, with the $2.3 trillion industry
            trailing the gains of the Standard Poor's 500 Index by about
            10 percentage points, according to Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds gained 5.4 percent on average through May 10,
            compared with a 15.4 percent rise for the SP 500 (SPX) and a 14.8
            percent increase for the typical mutual fund, a team of Goldman
            Sachs analysts led by Amanda Sneider and David Kostin wrote in a
            report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund managers have been hurt in 2013 by their bearish
            wagers on stocks, with 'popular' shorts such as Johnson
            Johnson (JNJ) and Gilead Sciences Inc. rising more than the broader
            equity market, Goldman Sachs said. Fewer than 5 percent of the
            hedge funds tracked by New York-based Goldman Sachs are beating
            the SP 500 or a typical mutual fund that buys stocks of the
            biggest U.S. companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 'multi-year trend of lackluster hedge-fund returns
            continues in 2013,' the analysts wrote. 'Strong long
            performance was not enough to outweigh the drag from popular
            short positions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds, which typically charge clients a 2 percent
            management fee and 20 percent of any investment gains, are
            private pools of capital that can bet on both rising and falling
            asset prices. From the start of 2009 to the end of April this
            year, the average fund has risen 21 percent after fees, compared
            with a 77 percent gain for the U.S. benchmark SP 500, data
            compiled by Bloomberg shows. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Forint Gains to 3-Month High as Goldman Ends Sell Recommendation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The forint rose to the strongest in
            three months, spurring Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to close its
            trade recommendation to sell Hungary's currency against the euro
            at a loss after the economy emerged from recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The forint appreciated as much as 0.6 percent and traded
            0.1 percent stronger at 289.21 per euro by 5:04 p.m. in
            Budapest, the seventh day of advances and extending its gains in
            the second quarter to 5.2 percent, the best performance among 31
            major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Goldman said on April 18
            that the forint may weaken to 310 per euro, recommending that
            investors close the trade if the exchange rate strengthens past
            the 290 level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The economy expanded 0.7 percent in the first quarter from
            the last three months of 2012, the first quarterly growth in
            more than a year, the Central Statistical Office said on May 15.
            The expansion in output also supported Prime Minister Viktor
            Orban's efforts to meet EU budget targets and exit the bloc's
            excessive-deficit procedure this year, which would avert the
            threat of cuts in development aid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We clearly underestimated the degree of risk premium for
            weaker economic outcomes already embedded in the currency,'
            Goldman analysts including Thomas Stolper in London wrote in a
            research report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Positive Catalysts' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'strong GDP print' and a 'smooth outcome in the
            ongoing budget negotiations with the EU,' emerged as 'positive
            catalysts' for the forint as the extra yield on Hungarian debt
            over U.S. treasuries declines, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on Hungary's benchmark 10-year forint bonds were
            little changed at 5.06 percent today after reaching a record-low
            4.93 percent last week. Yields on U.S. Treasuries of the same
            maturity rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
            1.97 percent. Hungary's central bank cut its benchmark rate for
            a ninth month to a record 4.75 percent on April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman said last month that the forint would weaken on the
            narrowing rate premium and as Hungary's policy makers tolerate a
            weaker forint level. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our broader fundamental view has not changed, but having
            just hit our recommended stop of 290, we recommend closing the
            position,' the Goldman analysts said. The trade incurred a
            'potential 2.86 percent loss including negative carry of about
            32 basis points in total,' the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hello Kitty Maker Sanrio Falls After Goldman Cuts Targets</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sanrio Co., (8136) maker and licenser of
            Hello Kitty goods, plunged in Tokyo trading after analysts
            including Sho Kawano at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut targets for
            the company, citing a waning outlook for U.S. sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares fell 16 percent, the most since 1995, to 2,598
            yen at the close in Tokyo trading. The stock has declined 41
            percent this year, compared with a 10 percent fall for the
            broader Topix index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kawano at Goldman lowered the estimate for operating profit
            in the year ending March by 7 percent, citing costs related to
            the company's shift back to merchandise sales from a focus on
            licensing. Sanrio founder Shintaro Tsuji had previously sought
            to reduce the reliance on marketing Hello Kitty goods by
            licensing character rights to companies that make different
            items based on them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see little prospect of a rapid turnaround given that
            this is a transition period,' Kawano wrote in a note to clients
            dated yesterday. Kawano cut the price target for the Tokyo-based
            company to 3,200 yen from 3,800 yen earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The licensing strategy had helped hold operating margins
            above 25 percent since fiscal 2011, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. Sanrio surged 61 percent last year, after dropping
            31 percent in 2012 and more than doubling in the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sells NYSE Market-Making Business to IMC</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
            sell its New York Stock Exchange market-making unit to IMC
            Financial Markets, a high-frequency trading firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IMC Chicago LLC, a unit of Amsterdam-based IMC, will become
            a designated market maker at the NYSE by acquiring Goldman
            Sachs's rights, the companies said in a statement today. The
            transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter,
            makes IMC a designated market maker for more than 630 securities
            and about 400 companies, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. (ICE)'s NYSE relies on
            traders known as designated market makers, or DMMs, to
            facilitate the buying and selling of shares. Barclays Plc (BARC) and
            KCG Holdings Inc. (KCG) are the biggest DMMs, followed by Goldman
            Sachs and Virtu Financial Inc., a person with knowledge of the
            matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's DMM employees are to join IMC as part of
            the transaction, including floor traders and corporate-relations
            staff, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed. New York-based
            Goldman Sachs was seeking as much as $30 million for the
            business, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Closely held IMC stands for International Marketmakers
            Combination and was founded in Amsterdam in 1989 by two traders
            who worked on the open outcry floor of Europe's first options
            exchange, according to the company website. IMC is a market
            maker in equities, bonds, commodities and currencies on 90
            exchanges globally. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China Rule Changes May Halt Copper-Financing, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;New rules from China to control
            capital inflows are likely to end commodity-financing deals,
            hurting the short-term outlook for copper, analysts at Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a research report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The regulations from the State Administration of Foreign
            Exchange, effective from June, will probably mean an end to
            Chinese use of copper as a tool to enable interest rate
            arbitrage, Goldman said. The London Metal Exchange market may
            need to 'carry' as much as 250,000 metric tons of additional
            physical copper over one to three months, about 4 percent to 5
            percent of quarterly global supply, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The clampdown follows severe discrepancies in China's trade
            data in the first four months that aroused suspicions about
            companies using trade deals to evade capital controls and take
            advantage of interest-rate arbitrage between China and overseas.
            Some Chinese banks have stopped issuing letters of credit for
            copper importers as the regulators tightened rules governing
            such trade, the National Business Daily reported yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The policy shift is directly targeted against abnormal
            trading activity and will at least have a negative impact on
            copper,' Judy Zhu, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc, said
            by phone from Shanghai today. 'Still, we don't know what
            portion of copper trade falls under the more stringent rules.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman sees downside risks to its six-month target of
            $8,000 a ton and unwound a September-delivery recommendation at
            a 3 percent loss, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Bearish' Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While some uncertainty remains, the new policies are in
            our view likely to bring to an end to these financing deals,'
            analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote. Stopping the deals
            completely 'would likely be bearish for copper prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in three months on the LME declined 2.9
            percent to $7,260 a ton at 3:42 p.m. in Tokyo. The metal has
            retreated 8.5 percent this year. The contract for delivery in
            September on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 2.6 percent to
            52,200 yuan ($8,508) a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A short-term increase in supply will also widen the so-called contango, where later-dated contracts
            cost more than
            those with nearer dates, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's trade surplus is 10 percent the official $61
            billion reported so far this year after accounting for fake
            transactions used to disguise so-called hot-money inflows,
            according to a report from Bank of America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The state administration increased scrutiny of trade and
            called on businesses with substantial foreign-exchange receipts
            to explain whether the capital flows are supported by real trade,
            analysts at Barclays Plc said in a research note earlier this
            week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Sachs Banker to Pay $100,000 in Pay-to-Play Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            investment banker will pay $100,000 to resolve U.S. regulatory
            claims that he made improper contributions to a Massachusetts
            treasurer while seeking state underwriting business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Neil Morrison, who worked on then-Treasurer Tim Cahill's
            unsuccessful run for governor from November 2008 to October 2010
            while he was employed by Goldman Sachs, also agreed to be barred
            from the securities industry for five years, the Securities and

            for their violations,' Elaine Greenberg, head of the SEC
            enforcement division's municipal securities unit, said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in September agreed to pay about $14 million
            to resolve the SEC's claims. Morrison, who was fired by Goldman
            Sachs in December 2010, and the New York-based bank settled
            without admitting or denying wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We certainly agree with Ms. Greenberg of the SEC that
            these sanctions are tough,' said Tom Kiley, Morrison's
            attorney. 'The fact that this is the first time there has been
            an industry bar for a violation of the pay-to-play rule is a
            pretty good indication the law wasn't clear at the time of the
            conduct.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Shareholders Approve Executive-Pay Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) investors voted to approve pay packages of top managers after Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein's total awards climbed 73 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compensation
            plan was approved with 87 percent support in the non-binding vote, according to a tally disclosed in a
            regulatory filing today after the firm's annual meeting in Salt Lake City. All of the bank's directors were
            elected, including former Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, who joined the board in January. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 58, was awarded $21 million for his performance in 2012, and received a $5 million
            long-term incentive. That was up from $12 million and a $3 million long-term award a year earlier. Shares of
            the New York-based bank climbed 41 percent in 2012, the most in three years, still leaving them 24 percent
            below their price at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Proxy-advisory firm Glass Lewis Co. said earlier
            this month that shareholders should oppose the bank's executive-pay plan. Goldman Sachs has been 'deficient'
            in linking compensation to company performance, Glass Lewis said. ISS Proxy Advisory Services USA supported
            the compensation program and said the increase in executive pay for 2012 reflected stronger company results.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shareholders rejected four measures proposed by investors and opposed by the board,
            according to the tallies, which include abstentions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Maximize Value &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One
            requested that the board hire an investment bank to explore options for maximizing shareholder value,
            including a merger or sale of the company. It received 1.3 percent of the vote, according to data in the
            filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two others would have required the bank to disclose the amount it spends on
            lobbying and to set up a committee to assess its policies on human rights. Those measures received 5.6
            percent and 3.5 percent support, respectively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another would give shareholders the
            ability to nominate their own selections for the board. It got support from 5.2 percent of the votes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs held the meeting for the first time at its offices in Salt Lake City, the bank's
            second-largest U.S. location. The bank has shifted more of its staff to what it calls high-value locations
            in an effort to cut costs. About 22 percent of Goldman Sachs employees work in such places, which also
            include Dallas and Singapore, up from 10 percent in 2007, Blankfein said in November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Committed to China After ICBC Sale, CEO Blankfein Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said his company is
            committed to growing in China even after it ended a seven-year
            investment in Industrial Commercial Bank of China Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs this week sold a $1.1 billion stake in ICBC,
            the world's largest lender by market value, a person familiar
            with the matter said. The firm reaped about $12 billion in sales
            proceeds and dividends from its $2.58 billion investment in
            ICBC, calculations by Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd. show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'ICBC is not the key to our interest in China, or the big
            reflection of it,' Blankfein, 58, said in a Bloomberg
            Television interview with Erik Schatzker. 'We're investing in
            China because China -- I was going to say it's the future, but
            it's a big part of the present as well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein said earlier this month that this will probably
            be China's century, even if it struggles in certain years.
            China's economic growth slowed to 7.7 percent in the first
            quarter, and a report yesterday showed manufacturing is
            contracting in May for the first time in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs served as a 'quasi-strategic' partner for
            ICBC as the Chinese government took its banking industry public,
            Blankfein said in the interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ukraine's Financing Needs May Force IMF Loan, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine may agree on an International
            Monetary Fund loan by September because of a wide current-account gap and limited access to global financial
            markets,
            according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The current-account deficit is likely to come in at
            around 8 percent of gross domestic product, or $12 billion to
            $14 billion,' Andrew Matheny, a Moscow-based analyst at
            Goldman, said today in an e-mailed note. 'This would bring
            reserves from the current $25 billion down to $13 billion to $15
            billion, in our view an unsustainably-low level.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine will probably sign its delayed Association
            Agreement with the European Union this year and may succeed in
            renegotiating a natural gas supply pact with Russia, which could
            save the government about $2 billion a year, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine is seeking IMF aid after plunging global prices for
            exports such as steel pushed its economy into recession. While
            the Washington-based lender has visited the former Soviet
            republic twice this year, it hasn't agreed on a new loan because
            its demands to reduce heating subsidies, make the exchange rate
            more flexible and tighten fiscal policy haven't been met. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GDP contracted 1.3 percent from a year earlier in the first
            quarter, state statistics data show. Growth may rebound in 2014
            should the country get IMF aid this summer, according to
            Matheny. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Links Bonuses to Protecting Firm Reputation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) linked
            bonuses and promotions to employees' success in protecting the
            firm's reputation and put new restrictions on some client
            transactions to avoid a repeat of the damage to its standing in
            the wake of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 'new-activity committee' will evaluate and approve
            suitability when clients undertake transactions that carry new
            risks, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in a report. When
            setting year-end pay, the firm is reviewing employees' efforts
            to protect its reputation and win clients' trust, according to
            the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is holding its annual shareholders'
            meeting today in Salt Lake City, created a business-standards
            committee in May 2010 as it faced a lawsuit from the Securities
            and Exchange Commission over a mortgage-related security called
            Abacus 2007-AC1. The firm settled that suit by agreeing to pay
            $550 million, and said it made a mistake in omitting disclosures
            to investors in the product. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If an Abacus transaction came today, it would encounter a
            completely different framework of processes, practices,
            procedures, transaction approval and review than what we had
            before,' said J. Michael Evans, a Goldman Sachs partner who led
            the business-standards committee with E. Gerald Corrigan. 'It
            might have the same name, but it would look a lot different.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Partner's Firm Says UBS Cuts Spoiled Partnership Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;An asset management firm founded by
            former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partner Vishal Gupta sued UBS
            AG (UBSN), saying investment banking cuts at the Swiss lender have
            undermined a joint venture. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Decura IM Investments LLP is seeking to terminate a 2012
            contract under which it would provide 'managed accounts' and
            'algorithmic strategies' for UBS customers, according to the
            bank's documents at a pre-trial hearing in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS has undertaken a 'drastic downscaling and disposal of
            its investment banking arm,' Decura's lawyer Andrew Fulton told
            a judge as he sought an accelerated trial in the dispute.
            London-based Decura argues the bank is now 'unable to market
            the services we are providing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland's biggest lender, has cut about 4,000 jobs
            since late 2012 and is exiting most debt-trading activities
            while focusing on its wealth management business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Swiss bank said in court documents it 'has not exited
            material product areas and maintains strong relationships in the
            relevant client areas.' Gupta didn't immediately respond to an
            e-mail seeking comment and UBS spokeswoman Hana Dunn declined to
            comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;UBS lawyer Adrian Beltrami told the court it was too soon
            to set a timetable for the litigation and the bank needed more
            details about the claim. 'The appropriate course is for a
            proper pleading of this case and a proper defense.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judge Richard Field said there should be another pre-trial
            hearing in July, when the court would consider the possibility
            of holding a trial in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Falling Out &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Decura and UBS had 'something of a falling out even before
            the venture was up-and-running,' Fulton said at the hearing.
            Hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from the agreement
            are at risk and Decura is in a 'position of limbo' until the
            issue is resolved, Fulton said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The venture isn't generating any money and an exclusivity
            arrangement means Decura can't look elsewhere, according to its
            court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Decura Group was founded in 2012 by Gupta, who previously
            worked at Goldman Sachs in a variety of roles including head of
            credit and equity exotics and fund derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is: Decura Im Investments LLP Ors v UBS AG
            London Branch, High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division
            Commercial Court, 14-561 &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Says Russian Retailers Best Poised for Bond Return</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russian retailers may be best
            positioned to crack open international credit markets as they're
            far removed from people blacklisted by the U.S. and Europe over
            Ukraine, said Clemens Grafe, chief economist at Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) in Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Russia's retailers have eschewed dollar bonds, they
            may find investor appetite internationally, Grafe said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There will eventually be some kind of separation whereby
            those that are far away from sanctions can come back to the
            market,' Grafe said in an interview at the St. Petersburg
            International Economic Forum. 'If one of the retailers said
            they wanted to issue a bond, I think the market would react
            pretty positively. It's a question of how we move out of
            there.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian capital outflows rose to $50.6 billion in the first
            quarter as President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and as
            tensions with the U.S. and European Union rose before the May 25
            presidential election in Ukraine. So far, the sanctions have
            targeted politicians and businessmen with interests in energy,
            construction and banking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If political uncertainty continues, Grafe said the 'risk-adjusted cost of capital' will go higher
            and that affects
            companies' credit ratings and has an impact on investment
            decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market has rallied quite a bit but the problem is no
            one really knows where the sanctions are going,' Grafe said.
            'It's not black and white.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Buyback Orders Reach Highest Level of Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors trying to explain the
            resilience of American equities during a global selloff may want
            to consider the pace that companies are repurchasing shares. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 79 percent of buyback orders at Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc.'s corporate trading desk were active yesterday, the most
            this year, according to a note to clients obtained by Bloomberg
            News. Companies stepped up purchases as the Standard Poor's
            500 Index fell as much as 3 percent from an intraday record
            reached May 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The buybacks may have limited losses in American equities
            after shares in Japan fell the most in two years and stock
            markets from London to Paris and Frankfurt saw declines of more
            than 2 percent. The SP 500 closed yesterday down 0.3 percent,
            trimming gains to 16 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The overall buy-the-dip mentality is very, very
            prevalent,' Jim Welsh, who helps oversee $6 billion at Forward
            Management LLC in San Francisco, said in a phone interview.
            'When you have corporate buybacks, it's kind of like a support
            underneath the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slipped 0.1 percent to 1,649.60 at 4 p.m. in
            New York, paring losses after falling as much as 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;$275 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies authorize buybacks and carry them out from time
            to time through brokerages as a way to reduce outstanding stock
            and increase per-share earnings. U.S. firms have announced about
            $275 billion of repurchases this quarter, the highest total in
            more than five years, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist
            at LPL Financial Holdings Inc. (LPLA), wrote in a report this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aflac Inc. (AFL), the largest provider of supplemental health
            insurance, plans to buy back $600 million in stock this year,
            Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos said at a presentation to
            investors this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merck Co., the second-biggest U.S. drugmaker, reached a
            deal to repurchase $5 billion of its shares from Goldman Sachs
            as part of a buyback program announced earlier this month,
            according to a statement on May 21. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A lot of these corporate buybacks are on autopilots, in
            other words, the board authorized X amount of purchases and
            these will be done over many months,' Forward's Welsh said.
            'Whether or not it's to the discretion of Goldman or the
            investment bank, I don't know. I do believe the amount of stock
            buybacks have definitely been helpful to the overall market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nasdaq Buyback Achievers Index, which consists of
            companies that repurchased at least 5 percent of their shares in
            the previous 12 months, has tripled since March 2009. That
            compares with the 144 percent gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares in the SP 500 are trading at about 15 times
            estimates for 2013 earnings, above the five-year average of
            about 13 times, according to a May 20 note from David Kostin,
            the chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Advises Selling WTI Oil, Buying Brent for December 2014</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) recommended
            selling West Texas Intermediate crude and buying North Sea Brent
            contracts for December 2014 as supplies accumulate on the U.S.
            Gulf Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The discount on WTI for delivery in December 2014 against
            the equivalent Brent contract has narrowed to $8.38 a barrel
            from $10.11 a month ago. The spread should widen as pipelines
            carrying crude out of the U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma,
            cause a build-up on the Gulf Coast that would lower the price of
            WTI versus the European benchmark, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If an oversupply of light, sweet crude in the U.S. Gulf
            coast becomes a problem as soon as third quarter 2013, it should
            be an even bigger problem in 2014,' analysts Jeffrey Currie and
            Stefan Wieler in New York said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The discount on front-month WTI against Brent, at $8.44 a
            barrel today, is still set to narrow toward $5 in the third
            quarter as new pipeline capacity to move oil out of Cushing
            causes stockpiles there to decline 'substantially,' Goldman
            said. Booming U.S. production expanded the discount on WTI to
            more than $28 a barrel in October, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Refinery maintenance and reduced pipeline flows are
            'putting a drag on a more meaningful decline of Cushing
            inventories,' according to the report. Supplies at Cushing
            increased by 0.9 percent to 50.2 million barrels in the week to
            May 17, according to the Energy Department. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Co-Founder of Goldman's Metro Unit Gets LME Warehouse</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Whelan Metals LLC, founded by a
            former co-owner of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s warehouse company,
            obtained approval from the London Metal Exchange to store
            industrial metals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whelan's first LME warehouse is in Detroit and will hold
            aluminum, North American aluminum alloy, nickel, lead and zinc,
            the LME said in a notice to members today. The Canton, Michigan-based company is part of W.F. Whelan Co., an
            automotive parts
            warehousing and brokerage company in Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman said last week it was exploring the sale of Metro,
            joining JPMorgan Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley in cutting back
            in commodities as Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Gunvor Group
            Ltd. expand. The Federal Reserve has said it's considering new
            limits on trading and warehousing of physical commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The uncertainty of the regulatory landscape, particularly
            in the U.S., means you're going to see more non-financial, more
            lightly or not regulated companies perhaps like Whelan moving
            into the warehousing space,' said Robin Bhar, an analyst at
            Societe Generale SA in London. 'There will always be companies
            looking at warehousing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Whelan, the president of the company, founded Metro
            International Trade Services LLC with Ed Schulak in 1991. Metro
            stores most of the aluminum in Detroit LME-licensed warehouses,
            according to exchange data. The wait time to withdraw aluminum
            from Metro's warehouses in the city was 683 days, or 98 weeks,
            at the end of April, according to an LME report this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Whelan Metals may expand beyond Detroit, Whelan said last
            year. He wasn't available for comment today and didn't return an
            e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BTG Pactual Commodities Warehousing LLC was approved by the
            LME to store metals in Detroit in April. Scale Distribution Ltd.
            in Liverpool, England, added depots in Detroit in January. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) vice president found liable for his part in
            selling a pre-crisis mortgage security that lost value, said he
            won't file an appeal in the civil case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While my lawyers have advised me there are strong grounds
            to appeal, I prefer to move forward with my education and close
            this difficult chapter of my life,' Tourre said in a statement
            today. 'I look forward to finishing my Ph.D. in economics and
            to making meaningful contributions to my field.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tourre, 35, was found liable Aug. 1 after a jury trial at
            which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed he
            intentionally misled investors in a subprime-mortgage vehicle
            called Abacus 2007-AC1. In March, he was ordered to pay more
            than $825,000 in penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was one of the government's most prominent
            efforts to fix responsibility for the housing market crash,
            which helped precipitate the worst economic downturn since the
            1930s. Critics have faulted the SEC for not doing more to police
            the abuses that helped lead to the crisis or to pursue top
            financial executives they say are responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which paid Tourre's legal fees, settled SEC
            claims over the Abacus transaction in July 2010 for $550
            million, a record at the time. No senior Goldman Sachs
            executives were questioned in Tourre's trial. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Buy Brazil as It Tips Nation to Win World Cup</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Buy Brazilian stocks because the country is going to win the World Cup, giving a boost to the local
            equity market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose analysts said the
            host nation's chances of winning the most-watched sports event this year are more than three times higher
            than the next most likely team, neighboring Argentina. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brazil will beat Argentina 3-1 in
            the final after they see off Germany and Spain in the semifinals, Goldman analysts including Jan Hatzius and
            Sven Jari Stehn said in a report. The host nation has a 48.5 percent probability of winning the FIFA
            tournament, followed by Argentina on 14.1 percent and Germany on 11.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More on

            &lt;p&gt;The win will boost the country's stock markets in the weeks after the final, based on history,
            Peter Oppenheimer and other Goldman strategists wrote in the note. But investors may need to move fast as
            the gains won't last, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The victor country's equity markets outperform global
            stocks by 3.5 percent on average in the first month after winning, 'although the outperformance fades
            significantly after three months,' according to the analysts. The winning nation sees its stock market
            underperform global markets by around 4 percent on average over the year following the final. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The message seems to be: enjoy the gains while they last,' Oppenheimer said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brazil's
            benchmark Ibovespa index has fallen almost 7 percent in the past year, which compares with a 15 percent gain
            by the SP 500 and a 12 percent advance by Europe's Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brazil Favored &lt;/h2&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Cohn Says Inactive Trading Environment Is Abnormal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
            Gary Cohn said low volatility and interest rates that are
            holding in tight ranges have resulted in an 'abnormal' trading
            market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The environment for all the firms is quite difficult
            right now,' Cohn, 53, said today at an investor conference in
            New York. 'What drives activity in our business is volatility.
            If markets never move or don't move, our clients really don't
            need to transact.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, 60,
            said yesterday that second-quarter trading revenue could fall as
            much as 25 percent from year-earlier levels, and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent drop earlier this month. Cohn
            stopped short of forecasting the decline for New York-based
            Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think, at the end of the day, it's economic in
            nature,' Cohn said of the cause of lower client volume. 'We
            don't have clear vision of economic growth or lack of growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cohn said while his firm has been gaining market share
            among clients in the trading business, the lack of activity has
            kept that from translating into higher revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Low interest rates and the Federal Reserve's program of
            quantitative easing have resulted in reduced volatility, Cohn
            said. He pointed to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
            Volatility Index, a gauge of U.S. stock volatility known as the
            VIX, which is trading 40 percent below its historical average.
            The yield on the 10-year Treasury note traded over the past
            three months in its narrowest band in the 35 years, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;

            run by billionaire John Paulson, which helped choose the
            securities underlying Abacus then made a billion-dollar bet it
            would fail, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest ruled in March that
            Tourre, who's in the middle of a six-year economics Ph.D.
            program at the University of Chicago, couldn't seek

        <headline>Goldman's Kostin Sees Hedge Funds Playing in Shrinking Sand Box</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Here's the problem facing hedge funds investing in the stock market this year, according to Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. chief equity strategist David Kostin: the sand box they like to play in has gotten a lot
            smaller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, equity hedge fund managers tend to have about a quarter of their
            investments in consumer-discretionary stocks, Kostin told Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg
            Television's 'Market Makers' program today. The dispersion of returns within that group is too small for
            managers on the prowl for stocks to buy or short, Kostin said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The opportunity set, the
            sand box, the swimming pool is very, very small,' Kostin said. 'It's been a very difficult year from a
            stock-selection perspective.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest gain among consumer-discretionary stocks over
            the past three months has been a 10 percent advance in Nordstrom Inc. and the biggest loss has been a 17
            percent drop in International Game Technology. That 27 percentage point dispersion of returns compares with
            a 71 percentage point difference during the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' basket of the 50 stocks favored by hedge funds has underperformed the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index (SPX) by about 2 percentage points so far this year after beating the market for
            13 straight years, according to Kostin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Glamor Stocks' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of
            the more richly valued 'glamor stocks' have dropped down or off the list of hedge-fund ownership, according
            to Kostin, as managers become more value-oriented. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ),
            Walgreen Co., American Realty Capital Properties Inc., CF Industries Holdings Inc., Forest Laboratories
            Inc., Halliburton Co., Cheniere Energy Inc., News Corp. and SunEdison Inc. were added to the firm's Hedge
            Fund VIP Basket, according to a May 21 report. Express Scripts Holding Co., Gilead Sciences Inc., Visa Inc.,
            Cole Real Estate Investment Inc., Liberty Global Plc, MasterCard Inc. (MA), Ocwen Financial Corp., T-Mobile
            US Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc were dropped. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kostin said, as a whole, he believes the
            market is fairly valued currently as the SP 500 trades about 11 points above his year-end forecast. The
            median stock in the SP 500 sells for about 17 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While 'that's expensive on a historical basis,' Kostin said
            growing profits will keep equities rising 'modestly toward the upside.' The strategist expects the SP 500 to
            reach 2,100 by the end of next year and 2,200 by the end of 2016. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This should give
            everyone plenty to talk about if they run into Bill Ackman or David Einhorn in the sand box. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government appointed UBS AG (UBSN)
            and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as joint global coordinators and
            joint bookrunners for the sale of Royal Mail Group Ltd, the
            state-owned postal service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) will be joint bookrunner and sponsor, and Bank
            of America (BAC) Merrill Lynch will be joint bookrunner for the deal,
            the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in London
            said in an e-mailed statement today. No final decision has been
            taken about how or when to sell Royal Mail, according to the
            statement. The government has said its preferred option is an
            initial public offering by the end of the current financial year
            next March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While all options for the form of sale remain open, it is
            important that we are in a position to move ahead swiftly with
            our chosen route once we take the final decision,' Business
            Minister Michael Fallon said in the statement. 'The appointed
            banking syndicate will work to make sure we are ready to proceed
            when the time comes and will be able to deliver strong, high-quality investor demand to ensure a successful
            IPO for the
            taxpayer and for Royal Mail.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The planned sale of Royal Mail will be the largest
            privatization in Britain since former Prime Minister John Major
            broke up the country's railway more than a decade ago. The 360-year-old company, one of the nation's biggest

            about 159,000 staff, has sought to adapt its letter-focused
            network to more lucrative package delivery in the face of
            competition from TNT NV of the Netherlands and Deutsche Post
            AG (DPW)'s DHL Express unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Mail's operating profit more than doubled in the year
            to March 31 to 403 million pounds ($609 million) as growth in
            web-based shopping spurred parcel deliveries, the company said
            in a statement last week. While sales gained 5 percent to 9.28
            billion pounds, parcel revenue rose 9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Mail appointed Equiniti Group this month to manage
            the distribution of 10 percent of its shares to employees
            following any sale. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Shuns Bonds Pimco's Gross Favors in 'New Neutral'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;As Bill Gross vows to restore top
            performance at the world's biggest bond fund, he's taking a path
            many of his rivals shun. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross, who manages the $230 billion Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX)
            at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach,
            California, is betting five-year Treasuries, which are more
            sensitive to changes in the central bank rate than longer-dated
            bonds, will do well because markets overestimate how much the
            Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Bond managers at
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. (JPM) say he's wrong and the intermediate bonds he holds will
            suffer when the Fed lifts borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once they see the whites of the eyes of full employment,
            they will want to normalize rates at a faster clip,' Jonathan Beinner, co-head of global fixed income at
            Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross, 70, is betting on an economic view he calls the
            'new neutral,' which argues that the top speeds of the biggest
            economies and their equilibrium interest rates have declined and
            won't return to levels seen before the financial crisis. While
            most bond managers agree rates will be lower, with the federal
            funds target ranging somewhere between 3 percent and 4 percent
            by 2018, Gross sees it at just 2 percent, making bonds
            attractive to Pimco that BlackRock and Goldman Sachs won't
            touch. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR), the
            second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, rose to a 22-month high
            after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) added the company to its
            'conviction buy' list and increased its price target 25
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company rose 9.6 percent to $8.35 at the close in New
            York, the highest since July 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MEMC 'remains our top idea across our solar coverage given
            a unique sum-of-the-parts story,' Brian Lee, a New York-based
            analyst at Goldman, wrote in a note to investors today. Lee
            increased his 12-month price target to $10 from $8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, based in St. Peters, Missouri, makes
            polysilicon wafers that can be used in semiconductors and solar
            cells. Shareholders are expected to vote today on changing the
            company's name to SunEdison Inc., the name of its solar unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hemlock Semiconductor Corp. is the biggest U.S. producer of
            polysilicon. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;South Korea's LS Industrial Systems
            Co. (010120) will supply solar panels for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s 40

            &lt;p&gt;LSIS will provide panels and other equipment for the plant
            through Kajima Corp. (1812) and the order is worth about 40 billion won

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Vice President Joe Biden will
            deliver the keynote address at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s North
            American Energy Summit next month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Biden will speak at the June 11 summit for leaders from
            government and companies, according to a statement today from
            New York-based Goldman Sachs. Petroleos Mexicanos Chief
            Executive Officer Emilio Lozoya, Duke Energy Corp. CEO Lynn Good, and U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz are
            all scheduled
            to attend, Goldman Sachs said this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shale oil and gas development in North America was listed
            as one of 25 key global trends in Goldman Sachs's 2013 annual
            report last month. The production may lead to a more stable oil
            market and strengthen the U.S. dollar, the bank's research
            analysts said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary Cohn, who will attend the summit, started
            in the commodities
            trading division. The pair has said the firm will remain
            committed to that unit, even as other large banks such as
            JPMorgan Chase Co. and Barclays Plc have scaled back. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Rupee Rally at Risk to Goldman as India Boosts Reserves</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;India is cashing in on the rupee's
            region-beating rally to boost its foreign reserves, prompting
            banks from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to HSBC Holdings Plc to
            predict an end to the currency's gains. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee will reverse this month's 2.2 percent advance and
            tumble more than 3 percent to 61 per dollar by year-end, the
            sharpest decline among 11 Asian currencies after the yen,
            according to Bloomberg strategist surveys. HSBC forecasts a drop
            to 62 by Dec. 31, while Goldman Sachs sees the rupee at 61 in
            six months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan has used the
            stronger rupee to buy foreign currency, pushing reserves above
            $300 billion for the first time since 2011 and bolstering the
            nation's defenses against speculators. Currency analysts are
            speculating Rajan's policy will outweigh the foreign investment
            lured by the election campaign of pro-business politician
            Narendra Modi, who was confirmed as prime minister this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We would caution against the conclusion that positive
            politics will translate into large gains for the currency,'
            Mallika Sachdeva, a Singapore-based strategist at Deutsche Bank
            AG, the world's second-biggest foreign-exchange trader, said May
            28 by e-mail. 'The RBI will be opportunistically buying
            dollars. India's reserves buffer, while large in absolute terms,
            is still weak versus regional peers on metrics like import or
            short-term debt cover.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Modi Inflows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revived confidence in Indian assets during the election
            campaign prompted foreigners to pump $14.6 billion into the
            nation's stocks and bonds this year, exceeding inflows of $12
            billion in the whole of 2013. The rupee surged almost 5 percent
            against the dollar since Dec. 31, the best performance after
            Brazil's real of 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee has already retreated more than 1 percent from an
            11-month high of 58.335 per dollar reached May 23 and traded at
            59.0462 as of 11:24 a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. says India will have to keep building
            its reserves because they're still only enough to pay for eight
            months of imports, the lowest coverage ratio since 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect Governor Rajan to continue to buy foreign
            exchange to improve import cover that's almost halved in the
            past six years,' Indranil Sengupta, a Mumbai-based economist at
            the U.S. investment bank, said May 27 by phone. 'We calculate
            the RBI needs to buy $80 billion in the next two years to just
            maintain that import cover.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deploying Gains &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's not the only developing country to parlay local-currency gains into foreign reserves in
            anticipation of an end
            to the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus program. The 12
            emerging markets with the biggest stockpiles outside of China
            lifted their combined holdings to $2.97 trillion as of May 26,
            about the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India boosted its reserves to $315 billion, $6 billion
            short of a record reached in September 2011, as the rupee
            rallied from an all-time low of 68.845 per dollar in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBI intervention will merely 'limit the pace of rupee
            appreciation,' Hamish Pepper, a Singapore-based strategist at
            Barclays Plc, said in a May 28 client note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The British bank raised its six-month rupee forecast to 59
            per dollar, from 61 previously, citing a strengthening economy
            and fund inflows. Nomura Holdings Inc. lifted its year-end
            prediction to 57 after the election, from 59.5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The victory of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party stoked
            optimism that India will be able to take measures to cut its
            current-account deficit, after the nation's last prime minister
            passed the fewest bills for any government to have completed a
            five-year term. The shortfall in the broadest measure of the
            country's trade narrowed to $32.4 billion in the fiscal year
            ended March from an unprecedented $88 billion in the prior
            period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Policy Switch &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 30 percent plunge in the rupee from 2011 through 2013 as
            the deficit widened prompted the RBI to prop up the currency
            last year by tightening the cash supply, raising interest rates
            and selling banks discounted foreign-exchange swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees the central bank's influence on the
            rupee as being negative this time around. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The RBI has said that it wouldn't want the gains on the
            current account to be lost due to a strengthening currency,
            which would reduce competitiveness,' Goldman Sachs analysts
            including Mumbai-based Tushar Poddar wrote in a May 22 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The RBI's increasing war chest will limit the rupee's
            short-term gains to 57, and the currency will fall to 61 by
            year-end as the post-election rally fizzles out, according to
            Credit Agricole SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The market has roped in too-high hopes about Modi,'
            Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at the bank in Hong Kong, said
            in a May 27 phone interview. 'There will be disappointment.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MasterCard to Stop Using Goldman's Asset-Management Services</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest
            U.S. payments network, will stop using Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
            for asset-management services after discussing the matter with a
            firm that advises shareholders on proxy votes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had received a total of $230,000 in 2011 and
            2012 for providing the services, Purchase, New York-based
            MasterCard said today in a regulatory filing. Directors had
            analyzed the payments when considering the independence of board
            member Mark Schwartz, a Goldman Sachs vice chairman, according
            to an annual filing last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 58, who joined the MasterCard board in 2006, is
            chairman of the audit committee and on the corporate governance
            committee, according to the April filing. Directors concluded
            that the payments to New York-based Goldman Sachs didn't
            compromise his independence, the filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MasterCard, led by Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga, 53,
            didn't elaborate on the reasoning behind the decision in today's
            filing, which didn't name the proxy firm. Chris Monteiro, a
            spokesman for the company, declined to comment, while Goldman
            Sachs's David Wells didn't have an immediate response. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Among 22 Candidates on Russia Eurobond List</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia selected 22 banks as possible
            organizers of its first Eurobond sale in more than a year, the
            government said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The list to manage a planned $7 billion offering has four
            domestic lenders and 18 foreign banks including Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), according
            to a government decree published today and dated May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The release indicates the government overcame a dispute
            between the economy and finance ministries over how to pick
            banks to organize the sale, which left Russia unable to tap the
            market when yields fell to record lows earlier this year. The
            world's largest energy exporter sold $7 billion of bonds in
            March 2012, including 30-year debt, in what was the largest
            emerging-market sovereign issue since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decree gives the Finance Ministry the right to select
            from among the approved organizers for bond issues this year on
            international capital markets. Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said May 16 the government was
            considering Deutsche
            Bank and Citigroup Inc. (C), while Sberbank CIB, VTB Capital and OAO
            Gazprombank were also candidates. There will be 'rotation'
            from the managers picked last year, according to Storchak. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Most Read on Bloomberg in October: Stocks, Goldman, Bonus Gloom</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports during October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Stocks Rally Most Since January, Bill Rates Fall on Debt
            Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks jumped the most since
            January and Treasury bill rates tumbled as lawmakers moved
            toward an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a
            default. Gold slumped while oil rallied. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Goldman Pushes Junior Investment Bankers to Take Weekends Off &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., this
            year's top merger adviser, is discouraging investment banking
            analysts from working weekends as it overhauls demands placed on
            entry-level employees and the support they receive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Stocks Surge as VIX, Treasury Bill Rates Slide on U.S. Debt
            Deal &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks surged while the
            benchmark gauge of options prices slid the most in two years as
            the Senate crafted a deal to end the government shutdown and
            raise the debt ceiling. Treasury bill rates dropped while energy
            led commodities higher and the yen fell against all major peers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;4. Goldman Shrinking Pay Shows Wall Street Set for Bonus Gloom &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which set
            Wall Street pay records when stocks surged and cheap credit
            abounded in 2007, is again leading the industry as markets boom
            anew: putting aside less money for staff and more for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Wall Street Hires Losers Turned Winners After College
            Athletics &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Inside One Equity Partners are as
            many as eight Olympians and even more of their world- or Olympic
            gold medals, said managing partner Dick Cashin, who competed
            internationally as a rower and now hires former college athletes
            while recommending others do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;6. Meredith Whitney Winds Down Brokerage After Setting Up Fund &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Meredith Whitney, who built her own
            Wall Street advisory firm after winning renown for a 2007 call
            on Citigroup Inc., deregistered her brokerage unit following
            three unprofitable years and is setting up an investment fund,
            according to industry records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;7. A U.S. Default Seen as Catastrophe Dwarfing Lehman's Demise &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Anyone who remembers the collapse of
            Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. little more than five years ago
            knows what a global financial disaster is. A U.S. government
            default, just weeks away if Congress fails to raise the debt
            ceiling as it now threatens to do, will be an economic calamity
            like none the world has ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;8. Ex-RBS Trader in U.K. Currency Probe Said to Be JPMorgan's
            Usher &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Richard Usher, JPMorgan Chase
            Co.'s chief dealer in London, wrote instant messages while he
            was at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc that U.K. regulators are
            scrutinizing as part of their investigation of alleged currency
            manipulation, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;9. Senate Crafts Fiscal Deal Amid Signs Boehner Will Accept It &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- The bipartisan leaders of the U.S.
            Senate reached an agreement to end the fiscal impasse and to
            increase U.S. borrowing authority. The Senate and House plan to
            vote on it later today, and the White House press secretary said
            President Barack Obama supports the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;10. RBS Said to Give Currency Trader's Chats to FCA Amid Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc has
            handed over records of instant messages to U.K. regulators after
            concluding a former currency trader's communications with
            counterparts at other firms may have been inappropriate,
            according to two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. John Boehner to Tea Party: Shut Yourself Down: Margaret
            Carlson &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 15 (Bloomberg) -- 'Thank you, Mr. President. Signed,
            John Boehner.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Why Wealthiest Are in the Taxman's Crosshairs: A. Gary
            Shilling &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- After the recent recession, the
            personal-taxes-to-personal-income ratio dropped well below the
            12.3 percent long-run average, a casualty of the tax cuts,
            depressed household incomes and the weak recovery. In
            combination with depressed corporate tax collections and
            increased federal spending -- especially in 2009, when outlays
            equaled 6 percent of gross domestic product -- these forces
            pushed the federal deficit to more than $1 trillion a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Apple's New IPad Is Slimmed Down, Speeded Up: Rich
            Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Apple calls the latest version of
            its full-sized tablet the iPad Air, which is a better name than
            'iPad Semi Mini.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Who Really Wins if JPMorgan Pays $13 Billion?: Jonathan Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Memories of the fictional sports
            announcer Biff Burns came to mind this weekend amid all of the
            anonymously attributed news reports that the Justice Department
            had reached a tentative settlement agreement with JPMorgan Chase
            Co. worth $13 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Steve Jobs Never Worried About Debt Ceiling: Caroline Baum &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Everyone knows, or has heard the
            cliche, that markets hate uncertainty. It's also a given that
            the future is always uncertain. How, then, do markets ever
            manage to function -- or, for that matter, businesses, which
            must make decisions today about investments that will pay off in
            the future? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Draghi Says ECB Ready to Act to Control Money Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Mario
            Draghi speaks at a news conference in Paris about euro-area
            inflation, money-market rates, economic activity and the process
            of an asset-quality review. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Drum-O'Neill Seeks College Athletes for Wall Street &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Carly Drum-O'Neill, founder of Drum
            Associates' unit devoted exclusively to current and former
            college athletes, talks about the executive search firm's
            efforts to find accomplished athletes for entry-level positions
            on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Obama Warns of Deep Recession If Debt Limit Not Raised &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 8 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama speaks about
            the U.S. government shutdown and federal debt ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;4. Bitcoin Price Swings as Startups Draw Regulators' Glare &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin, the digital currency, has
            gained prominence this year for its wild price swings and for
            piquing the interest of regulators from New York to Germany.
            Bloomberg's Stephanie Baker reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;5. Maserati's Quattroporte Sedan Takes On Audi, Mercedes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The sixth generation Maserati
            Quattroporte sedan is seen in a promotional video from Maserati
            SpA. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Goldman Pushes Junior Investment Bankers to Take Weekends Off &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., this
            year's top merger adviser, is discouraging investment banking
            analysts from working weekends as it overhauls demands placed on
            entry-level employees and the support they receive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Goldman Shrinking Pay Shows Wall Street Set for Bonus Gloom &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which set
            Wall Street pay records when stocks surged and cheap credit
            abounded in 2007, is again leading the industry as markets boom
            anew: putting aside less money for staff and more for investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Citigroup, JPMorgan Said to Put Senior Currency Dealers on
            Leave &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
            Co. are putting their top London currency dealers on leave after
            regulators probing the manipulation of foreign-exchange rates
            started investigating the traders' use of an instant-message
            group, three people with knowledge of the moves said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;4. Fed Keeps $85 Billion QE Pace Awaiting Signs Growth Picks Up &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve decided to press

            to see more evidence that the economy will continue to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Sally Dawson, Deutsche Bank Debt Executive in London, Dies at
            39 &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Sally Dawson, a Deutsche Bank AG
            executive in London who specialized in high-yield and

            &lt;h2&gt;6. Deutsche Bank Profit Slumps 94% on 1.2 Billion-Euro Charge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Bank AG, Europe's largest
            investment bank by revenue, said third-quarter profit slid 94
            percent after it set aside 1.2 billion euros ($1.65 billion) to
            cover potential legal costs and income from debt trading fell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;7. Insurance Policies Are Canceled in New Hurdle for Obamacare &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Obamacare rollout is leading to
            the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of health insurance
            plans nationwide, contradicting President Barack Obama's
            repeated pledge that people who like their coverage can keep it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;8. Barclays Said to Suspend Chief FX Dealer Ashton Amid Probe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc has suspended three

            probe into potential foreign-exchange manipulation, according to
            a person with knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;9. Citigroup Currency Staff Work London Evenings on Dodd-Frank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- For the foreign-exchange sales team
            in Citigroup Inc.'s London office, Dodd-Frank regulations mean
            extra hours at work. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10. U.S. Stocks Fall With Gold, Treasuries on Fed Policy
            Statement &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The Standard Poor's 500 Index fell
            for the first time in five days and gold and Treasuries dropped,
            while the dollar reversed earlier declines, as the Federal
            Reserve fueled speculation it will begin to slow the pace of
            stimulus in coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. Apple's New IPad Is Slimmed Down, Speeded Up: Rich
            Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Apple calls the latest version of
            its full-sized tablet the iPad Air, which is a better name than
            'iPad Semi Mini.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. If Fed Can't Get Good Numbers, Check the Leaders: Caroline
            Baum &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Financial markets have become
            increasingly dependent on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is
            dependent on data (just in case you didn't know). The data for
            the next few months will be distorted by the federal government
            shutdown during the first half of October. So what's a
            responsible policy maker or investor to do to get a handle on
            how the U.S. economy is faring? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. China Mimics the Worst of Abenomics at Worst Time: William
            Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- If imitation really is the greatest
            form of flattery, Shinzo Abe should be thrilled the Chinese are
            copying his 'Abenomics' strategy to excite investors. The rest
            of the world shouldn't be. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Federal Reserve's Bubble Alarm Is Stuck on Snooze: Jonathan
            Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve's policy of
            unrestrained quantitative easing has worked like rocket fuel for
            U.S. stocks this year. Case in point: Rocket Fuel Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Edward Snowden Has Japan Copying China's Playbook: William
            Pesek &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Shinzo Abe is so obsessed with China
            eclipsing Japan on the global stage that he's adopting some of
            his neighbor's policies. What else can we say about the secrecy
            law the prime minister's cabinet approved on Oct. 25, an act
            that would do so much to undermine and constrain his people's
            right to know? &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Rocker Lou Reed Dies at 71, Sales of Songs May Surge &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Lou Reed, a New York-based rock
            musician who co-founded the Velvet Underground and wrote and
            sang 'Walk on the Wild Side,' has died at the age of 71. Mark
            Beech reports with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television's
            'The Pulse.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Sebelius Apologizes for Obamacare Website Problems &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Health and Human Services
            Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testifies before the House Energy
            and Commerce Committee in Washington about problems with
            healthcare.gov, the federal health-insurance exchange website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Red Sox Beat Cardinals 6-1 for Third World Series Title &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- The Boston Red Sox won their third
            World Series title in the last decade with a 6-1 defeat of the
            St. Louis Cardinals, wrapping up a championship at home for the
            first time in 95 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. New Apple IPad Is Slimmed Down, Speeded Up: Rich Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's Rich Jaroslovsky reviews
            Apple Inc.'s iPad Air, the latest version of its full-sized
            tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;5. Cook Says Apple Is Exploring New Product Categories &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Tim Cook, chief executive officer of
            Apple Inc., and Peter Oppenheimer, chief financial officer,
            speak on a teleconference about the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results and first-quarter forecast. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gold Bug Schiff Counters Goldman on First Drop Since 2000</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Peter Schiff lays an iPod-sized bar valued at about $40,000 on the sun room floor of his
            Connecticut mansion, and calculates it would cost about $250,000 for each floor tile to pave the room with
            gold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He shows off $50 gold chips, to be used when paper money becomes worthless, a
            prediction repeated on his daily two-hour radio show broadcast from his basement studio to 68 stations in 30
            states and 50,000 listeners online. The unabashed gold bug's Euro Pacific Capital Inc. manages a $20 million
            mutual fund that invests in stocks related to the metal and lost 6.4 percent since it began in July. The
            Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index slid 1.5 percent in the same period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schiff,
            50, isn't fazed that gold is heading for its first annual price drop in 13 years, or that Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. has called it a 'slam-dunk sell.' He predicts bullion will reverse its 21 percent year-to-date
            decline and probably surge 52 percent to reach a record $2,000 an ounce within a year. That's just the
            beginning: Schiff said he would 'be amazed' if the U.S. dollar didn't collapse and gold failed to skyrocket

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to BofA Are Said to Trade With SAC After Plea Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) are among Wall Street
            firms still catering to SAC Capital Advisors LP after the hedge
            fund agreed to plead guilty to insider trading charges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The banks, which also include Morgan Stanley, continue to
            provide trading and prime-brokerage services to SAC, said people
            briefed on the matter, who requested anonymity when discussing
            specific clients. The hedge-fund firm, run by billionaire Steven A. Cohen, agreed yesterday to pay $1.8
            billion -- a record
            penalty for insider trading -- to settle allegations it
            illicitly reaped hundreds of millions of dollars since 1999. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The presumption is that if JPMorgan should resign the
            business, then someone else would do it,' said Roy Smith, a
            finance professor at New York University's Stern School of
            Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. 'These people all
            say we serve our clients, so if our clients get into trouble, we
            serve them as long as we can.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banks are weighing the potential damage to their
            reputations and finances if they continue dealing with Stamford,
            Connecticut-based SAC, one of Wall Street's largest trading
            clients. While SAC agreed to stop managing money for outsiders,
            it may continue investing Cohen's personal fortune of about $9
            billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Steelmakers Rise as Goldman Predicts Recovery</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Steel Corp. (X) and AK Steel Holding
            Corp. (AKS) gained after after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
            rating on the unprofitable companies to buy from sell and said
            the outlook for the domestic steel industry is improving because
            of higher demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AK rose 11 percent to $5.11 at 10:31 a.m. in New York after
            climbing as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday increase
            since June 27. U.S. Steel Corp., the country's largest producer
            of the metal by volume, rose as much as 5.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We see the sector heading to a sustainable recovery over
            the coming years,' Sal Tharani, a New York-based analyst at
            Goldman, said in a note today. He revised his view of the U.S.
            steel industry to 'neutral' from 'cautious.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The supply-demand fundamentals for steel are starting to
            look more appealing, particularly for flat steel, as some supply
            has been taken out and demand drivers are firmly in place,' he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. steel industry has suffered from global
            overcapacity since the financial crisis. Pittsburgh-based U.S.
            Steel, the country's largest producer of the metal by volume,
            said Oct. 30 it will permanently close parts of plants in the
            U.S. and Canada as it tries to reduce costs after four
            unprofitable quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Domestic steel prices are recovering. Hot-rolled steel
            coil, a benchmark product used in manufacturing, are at $660 a
            short ton, the highest since September last year, according to
            data from The Steel Index, a trade publication. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Steel and West Chester, Ohio-based AK use blast
            furnaces to process iron ore and then combine the iron with
            other raw materials in basic-oxygen furnaces to make steel. U.S.
            competitors Nucor Corp. (NUE) and Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD), which remelt
            scrap, have cheaper operating costs. Tharani today raised Fort
            Wayne, Indiana-based Steel Dynamics to buy from hold. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Asia Fund Chairman Bolitho to Leave Company</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Oliver Bolitho, chairman of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s fund management division in Asia, is leaving
            after 15 years at the company, according to an internal memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bolitho will become an advisory director after his
            retirement at the end of the year, according to the Nov. 4 memo
            obtained by Bloomberg. Christopher Jun, a spokesman for Goldman
            Sachs in Seoul, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bolitho, a U.K. citizen, served as head of Goldman Sachs's
            U.K. and Irish institutional business from 2001 until moving to
            Hong Kong in 2007 to run the fund business in Asia outside of
            Japan. A partner since 2008, Bolitho became chairman of Goldman
            Sachs Asset Management last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His departure comes almost a year after Goldman Sachs Asset
            Management moved Sheila Patel to Singapore from London to lead
            the fund business in Asia outside of Japan and said that Bolitho
            would report to Patel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had $878 billion of assets under management
            as of Sept. 30, according to the New York-based company's third-quarter earnings report. The company doesn't
            report how much of
            that is in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AsianInvestor, a Hong Kong-based trade journal, reported
            Bolitho's pending departure on its website earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management runs hedge funds, private
            equity and real estate investments alongside those in fixed
            income, stocks, money markets and commodities, according to its
            website. The unit employs more than 700 investment specialists
            in 32 offices worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Benchmark Asset Management Co.,
            India's largest provider of index-tracking funds, in March 2011,
            after setting up its own mutual-fund unit in the country in
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It also teamed up with RHB Capital Bhd. (RHBC), Malaysia's fifth-largest banking group, in 2010 to
            jointly develop fund
            management products. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Surpasses Liquidity Minimum Under Fed Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s liquidity
            coverage ratio, a measure of its ability to survive a credit-market freeze, surpasses the minimum proposed
            by the Federal
            Reserve last month, said Treasurer Liz Beshel Robinson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would top the minimum even under the Fed's
            proposed stricter guidelines and therefore wouldn't be affected
            by a shorter timeline than international banks may face,
            Robinson said today on a conference-call with fixed-income
            investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed last month proposed rules to require the biggest
            banks to hold 30 days of easy-to-sell assets to make the
            companies safer in the event of a credit crisis like the one in
            2008. The plan had a shorter timeline than non-U.S. banks will
            face and was more restrictive in what U.S. banks can include
            among their assets. &lt;/p&gt;

            retiring. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sherwood, a London-based vice chairman, will coordinate the
            company's units in so-called growth markets, Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn said today
            in a memo to employees. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the New
            York-based bank, confirmed the memo's contents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sherwood, 48, 'will help drive our strategy, identify new
            commercial opportunities and allocate resources in countries
            experiencing stronger economic growth and rapid business and
            capital markets development,' Blankfein and Cohn wrote in the
            memo. 'Michael will also oversee the performance of our
            businesses, including their footprint and pace of growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sherwood, a Briton, joined Goldman Sachs in 1986 and became
            a partner in 1994, according to the memo. He was promoted to
            vice chairman in February 2008, at the same time as Evans, and
            kept his role as co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sherwood rose through the ranks of the fixed-income
            department like Blankfein, 59, and Cohn, 53. He was co-head of
            the trading business from 2003 to 2008. He's currently chairman
            of the partnership committee. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman-Led Twitter Underwriters Share $59.2 Million in IPO Fees</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other underwriters on Twitter Inc. (TWTR)'s initial public offering
            will share about $59.2 million for managing the sale after accepting one of the smallest fee rates for a
            U.S. IPO this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The banks are receiving 3.25 percent of the $1.82 billion that
            Twitter raised in its IPO, according to a regulatory filing today. Goldman Sachs led the sale, with help
            from firms including Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase Co. The fee pool is typically split unevenly among
            underwriters, with larger shares going to banks more actively involved in the process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter's
            banker fees reflect a smaller proportion than underwriters have received in nearly every U.S. initial
            offering this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. While investment banks use fee income as a major
            measure of success in deal underwriting, firms are sometimes willing to take a smaller share of proceeds for
            high-profile sales that may generate future business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Goldman being the first name on
            the S-1 has little to do with fees,' Max Wolff, chief economist and strategist at ZT Wealth, said by phone
            from New York. 'This is about Goldman rebalancing itself as a serious leader and competing with Morgan
            Stanley's dominant position in technology.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the world's
            most profitable securities firm before the financial crisis,
            said it's under investigation by regulators probing the
            potential manipulation of foreign-exchange rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currencies and commodities were added to a list of
            financial products and related activities that are subject to
            investigation, according to a regulatory filing published by the
            New York-based company today. The filing also added options
            trading and technology systems and controls to the list. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigators are looking at the firm's 'trading
            activities and communications in connection with the
            establishment of benchmark rates,' Goldman Sachs said in the
            filing. The company 'is cooperating with all such regulatory
            investigations and reviews.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least eight banks including Citigroup Inc. (C) and JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM) have said they're being investigated by authorities
            examining the $5.3 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market and
            are cooperating. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Barclays Plc (BARC) have
            suspended or put on leave some of their most senior currency
            traders amid the inquiry. No one has been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is examining legal and regulatory
            exemptions that have allowed banks including Goldman Sachs to
            trade and own raw materials such as oil, coal and metals, a

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Traders Had 15 Losing Days in 3rd Quarter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
            the steepest drop in trading revenue among Wall Street's largest
            banks, posted losses from that business on 15 days during the
            third quarter, the most since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders made more than $100 million on four days in the
            three months ended Sept. 30, down from seven days in the year-earlier period, the New York-based company
            said in a regulatory
            filing today. None of the losses were more than $50 million and
            none topped the bank's so-called value-at-risk, an estimate of
            potential trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $2.86 billion from its trading
            division in the third quarter, a 32 percent decrease from the
            year-earlier period. Client activity fell and the firm struggled
            to manage inventory amid speculation about whether the Federal
            Reserve would ease its economic stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Concerns about the global economic outlook created a more
            difficult operating environment for our clients in the third
            quarter,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said on a
            conference call last month. 'These challenges were amplified by
            the seasonal slowdown traditionally impacting client activity in
            July and August.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's inventory fell to $244.3 billion, a 25 percent
            drop from a year earlier and a 12 percent decline from the end
            of the second quarter. The was the biggest decline and the
            lowest absolute amount since the bank started disclosing the
            figure at the end of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of days with losses was the highest since the
            firm had 17 such days in the fourth quarter of 2011. The four
            days of gains of more than $100 million were the fewest since
            the second quarter of 2012. Goldman Sachs hasn't had fewer than
            four such days in a quarter since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. posted daily losses twice during the
            quarter, including a $21 million misstep. Morgan Stanley posted
            losses on seven days, including two that topped $25 million. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Credit Swaps in U.S. Rise; Goldman Sachs Sells Five-Year Notes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A gauge of U.S. company credit risk
            rose as signs of an improving economy fueled speculation that
            the Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus sooner than estimated.
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold $1 billion of floating-rate bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
            credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
            against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
            1.5 basis points from Nov. 8 to 73.3 basis points as of 4:24
            p.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
            Bond markets were closed yesterday in the U.S. for the Veterans
            Day holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treasury yields have climbed to an eight-week high since
            the Labor Department's better-than-forecast jobs report last
            week stoked speculation that the central bank would accelerate
            its timetable for slowing the pace of its $85 billion in monthly
            purchases of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The central bank's
            program is becoming riskier by the day, Dallas Fed President
            Richard Fisher said in a speech in Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the sell-off in Treasuries that started on Friday
            and has continued to some extent today, the markets are a little
            on edge on when tapering will take place,' Marc Pinto, the head
            of corporate bond strategy at Susquehanna International Group
            LLP, said in a telephone interview from New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The swaps index typically rises as investor confidence
            deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
            buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
            less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
            $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Tipping Point' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American employers added 204,000 workers in October,
            topping the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg poll of
            economists, Labor Department figures showed on Nov. 8. The
            median forecast of 91 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
            for a gain of 120,000 jobs, with estimates ranging from
            increases of 50,000 to 175,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. 10-year yield climbed 2 basis points, or 0.02
            percentage point, to 2.77 percent as of 4:24 p.m. in New York
            from the close on Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed will start cutting its bond buying in March,
            according to the median estimate of 32 economists in a Bloomberg
            News survey conducted Nov. 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a tipping point where monetary accommodation
            comes to be viewed not as the pleasant stimulus that levitates
            bond and stock and housing markets all over the world,' Fisher
            said today at an event in Melbourne. 'None of us really know
            where that tipping point is.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Bonds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, sold
            the five-year, senior unsecured notes to yield 110 basis points
            more than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt is expected to
            be rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
            Yield Index, a credit-swaps benchmark tied to speculative-grade
            bonds, rose 6.1 basis points from Nov. 8 to 356.7 basis points,
            Bloomberg prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average extra yield investors demand to hold dollar-denominated, investment-grade corporate
            bonds rather than
            similar-maturity Treasuries increased 1.4 basis points to 129.2
            basis points, Bloomberg data show. The measure for speculative-grade, or junk-rated, debt rose 5.5 basis
            points to 540.6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk, or junk debt is rated below Baa3 by
            Moody's and lower than BBB- at Standard Poor's. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blankfein Sees Goldman ROE Boost Without Wholesale Change</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, won't make any 'wholesale
            strategic change' to help improve returns, Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we have generated good relative returns in the last
            five years, they are hardly aspirational,' Blankfein, 59, said
            today at an investor conference in New York. 'We are committed
            to improving them regardless of the challenges presented in the
            current environment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has earned a return on equity of 10 percent
            so far this year, compared with 11 percent in 2012 and more than
            30 percent before the financial crisis. The shares trade at 1.06
            times book value, indicating that investors estimate the firm's
            cost of equity at around 10 percent, a figure that Blankfein
            said the company is focused on. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People throw out that number, 10 percent, I happen to
            think that's a pretty high number given that the risk-free rate
            of return is zero,' Blankfein said at a separate conference in
            New York today. 'But the market seems to have focused on that,
            so we've kind of focused on that number. Not for the long-term,
            but for this part of the cycle, I think that looks OK.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which before the financial crisis targeted a
            long-term ROE of 20 percent, has declined to set a goal since
            then, saying it wanted to see the effects of new rules. Recent
            international regulations have required banks to hold more
            equity capital, pushing down ROE. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said the firm would increase return on
            equity, a measure of profitability, by making 'incremental improvements' in revenue, expenses and capital
            management. Close

        <headline>Goldman Names Managing Directors in Biennial Promotions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, promoted 280 employees to
            managing
            director, up from 266 last year, as it begins making the
            selections every two years instead of annually. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The promotions disclosed today on the company's website
            take effect Jan. 1 and won't happen again until 2015, after the
            bank decided earlier this year to change to a biennial process.
            New York-based Goldman Sachs last year named 70 people to its
            partnership, the fewest since the firm became a public company
            in 1999, and won't promote new partners until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said yesterday
            that the firm is always focused on recruiting and retaining top
            talent, even as it sets aside a lower portion of revenue for
            compensation. Blankfein, 59, said the average tenure for
            employees with a title of vice president or higher is 9.1 years,
            up from 7.6 years in 2001. Managing director is the second-highest title among non-executives. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The insight and perspective that is gained by living
            through several cycles is impossible to quantify, and having a
            group of professionals who have experienced those cycles
            together also carries an immeasurable benefit,' Blankfein said
            yesterday at an investor conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'The Federation' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The securities division has the most new managing directors
            with 94, while 51 are in investment banking, 39 in investment
            management, 14 in research and eight in merchant banking, said
            David Wells, a bank spokesman. The other 74 work for the firm's
            administrative arm, known as 'The Federation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 56 percent of those just promoted are based in the
            Americas, 27 percent in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 15
            percent in Asia-Pacific and 2 percent in India, Wells said. Last
            year, about 58 percent were in the Americas, 26 percent in EMEA
            and 17 percent in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Women comprise 20 percent of the incoming class of managing
            directors, compared with 23 percent in 2012 and 19 percent in
            2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average compensation cost per employee at Goldman Sachs
            fell 5 percent to $319,755 in the first nine months of 2013,
            even as revenue climbed 2 percent. The company employed 32,600
            people at the end of September, 3,100 fewer than at the end of
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Rigorous Exercise' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Managing directors typically receive a base salary of
            $500,000, lower than the $900,000 granted to partners. Both also
            get bonuses that can boost total compensation into the millions
            of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 7 percent of Goldman Sachs's employees hold the
            managing director title. The firm created a non-partner managing
            director title in 1996 to recognize top workers who weren't yet
            partners, and decided in March to switch from the annual
            tradition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'A biennial process will allow us to invest more in the
            managing-director selection process so that it will continue to
            be a disciplined and rigorous exercise,' the bank said in a
            March memo to employees. 'This will help to ensure that the
            managing director title remains as aspirational as it should be
            for our top performers.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm's first class of 87 managing directors included
            William C. Dudley, now president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
            New York; Clifford S. Asness, who left in 1998 to start hedge
            fund AQR Capital Management LLC; and Richard J. Gnodde, who was
            named co-head of global investment banking at Goldman Sachs in
            May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The following is a list of the new managing directors: &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Blankfein Says Goldman Sachs Can Boost ROE Without Major Changes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
            bank most reliant on trading, won't make any 'wholesale
            strategic change' to help improve returns, Chief Executive
            Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we have generated good relative returns in the last
            five years, they are hardly aspirational,' Blankfein, 59, said
            yesterday at an investor conference in New York. 'We are
            committed to improving them regardless of the challenges
            presented in the current environment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has earned a return on equity of 10 percent
            so far this year, compared with 11 percent in 2012 and more than
            30 percent before the financial crisis. The shares trade at 1.06
            times book value, indicating that investors estimate the firm's
            cost of equity at around 10 percent, a figure that Blankfein
            said the company is focused on. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People throw out that number, 10 percent, I happen to
            think that's a pretty high number given that the risk-free rate
            of return is zero,' Blankfein said at a separate conference in
            New York yesterday. 'But the market seems to have focused on
            that, so we've kind of focused on that number. Not for the long-term, but for this part of the cycle, I
            think that looks OK.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which before the financial crisis targeted a
            long-term ROE of 20 percent, has declined to set a goal since
            then, saying it wanted to see the effects of new rules. Recent
            international regulations have required banks to hold more
            equity capital, pushing down ROE. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Pulls Loan From Commercial Mortgage Bond Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pulled a
            loan from a commercial-mortgage bond deal sold last week after
            investors balked at the debt amid concern that underwriting
            standards are slipping in the $550 billion market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $47.5 million loan, linked to 10 shopping malls in
            Nebraska and South Dakota, was removed because of a 'potential
            dispute' between the borrower and a lender, according to a
            filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The debt, called the Perkins Retail Portfolio, was
            originated by Jefferies Group Inc., according to deal documents
            obtained by Bloomberg News. C-III Capital Partners, the servicer
            overseeing the mortgage, was seeking additional information from
            the borrower about the properties while the $1.1 billion
            commercial-mortgage backed securities offering was being
            marketed, according to a Nov. 5 statement on C-III's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is one of the first instances that we are aware of
            that a loan was pulled out of CMBS deal after pricing,' said
            Richard Hill, a debt analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York.
            'That deal priced at a significant concession to another deal
            priced that same day, so investors were already concerned about
            the credit quality.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A top-ranked portion of the transaction maturing in 10
            years was sold to yield 108 basis points more than the benchmark
            swap rate, compared with 96 basis points on similar debt sold by
            JPMorgan Chase Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
            basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Incorrect Statements' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Richard
            Khaleel of Jefferies declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Perkins loan wasn't the only mortgage that raised red
            flags. In a supplement distributed to bond buyers prior to the
            pricing, the underwriters disclosed additional information about
            a $3.8 million loan linked to manufactured housing in Virginia,
            noting that the loan documents were being modified because the
            borrower failed to disclose a guilty plea in 1989 arising from
            'incorrect statements' submitted to lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of bonds linked to everything from strip malls to
            skyscrapers are poised to double to $70 billion this year as
            investors chase riskier assets with the Federal Reserve
            suppressing interest rates for almost five years, according to
            Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moody's Investors Service is increasing the amount of
            credit protection required to obtain investment-grade rankings
            on the debt as loans get risker, the New York-based rating
            company said in an Oct. 28 report. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>N.Y. Fed Seeks Dismissal of Examiner Suit Over Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
            asked a judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a former bank
            examiner who alleged she was fired for refusing to change
            findings about Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s conflict of interest
            policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York Fed said in a filing yesterday in Manhattan
            federal court that Carmen Segarra 'flagrantly violated' the
            bank's policies, federal regulations and federal criminal law by
            making confidential supervisory information public in her
            lawsuit and circulating it to the news media without permission
            from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed also said Segarra can't sue under the federal
            whistle-blower statute because her concerns about Goldman
            Sachs's policy didn't involve a violation of law or regulations.
            While she claimed Goldman lacked a firm-wide conflict-of-interest policy, Goldman's policies were actually
            available and
            posted on its public website, the Fed said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The gravamen of the complaint is not a whistle-blower's
            provision of information, but a non-actionable disagreement
            between a supervised employee and more senior colleagues over
            how to interpret a Federal Reserve policy,' lawyers for the Fed
            wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank said it fired Segarra for cause and not because
            she identified a possible violation of law or regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Segarra said in a lawsuit filed in October that she
            examined the legal and compliance divisions of Goldman Sachs in
            late 2011 and early 2012 and found that they lacked a policy
            that conformed with federal banking regulations. She alleges she
            was fired because she refused to withdraw her findings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said then that it has a comprehensive
            approach to addressing conflicts through firmwide and divisional
            policies and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Segarra v. Federal Reserve Bank of New York,13-cv-07173, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. Equity Traders' Bonuses Seen Rising as Rates Salesmen Face
            Drop &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Compensation for Wall Street's
            equities salesmen and traders is expected to rise in 2013, while
            total pay for employees in fixed-income units may drop 10
            percent, according to recruitment firm Options Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Auschwitz Survivor's Daughter Turns Billionaire on Toll Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -' Vera Guerin, whose late father
            Nathan Shapell survived two Nazi concentration camps and became
            one of California's largest property developers, emerged as a
            billionaire last week after Toll Brothers Inc. agreed to buy her
            family's Shapell Industries Inc.'s homebuilding business for
            $1.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Goldman Names 280 Managing Directors in Biennial Promotions &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, promoted
            280 employees to managing
            director, up from 266 last year, as it begins making the
            selections every two years instead of annually. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. SP 500 Reaches Record as Treasuries Extend Advance After
            Yellen &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose, with the Standard
            Poor's 500 Index climbing to a record, as retailers led gains
            amid optimism over the holiday shopping season. Treasuries
            extended their advance after Janet Yellen said the American
            economy must improve before cuts to monetary stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. NYC's World Trade Tower Opens 40% Empty in Revival: Real
            Estate &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- The first skyscraper at lower
            Manhattan's World Trade Center is set to open with two days of
            ceremonies to mark the renewal of the area after its destruction
            by terrorists. When the fanfare subsides, the task will be
            filling the 40 percent of the tower that's empty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;6. Moody's Downgrades Four U.S. Banks on Federal Support Review &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Moody's Investors Service cut its
            ratings on four of the biggest U.S. banks after deciding the
            government would be less likely to help them repay creditors in
            a crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;7. Apple Said Developing Curved IPhone Screens, New Sensors &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is developing new iPhone
            designs including bigger screens with curved glass and enhanced
            sensors that can detect different levels of pressure, said a
            person familiar with the plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;8. Yellen Signals More Bond Purchases Until Recovery Improves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) --Janet Yellen, nominated to be the
            next chairman of the Federal Reserve, signaled she will carry on
            the central bank's unprecedented stimulus until she sees
            improvement in an economy that's operating well below potential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;9. Yellen Says U.S. Economy Must Improve Before Fed Tapers QE &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Janet Yellen, nominated to be the
            next chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the economy and labor
            market are performing 'far short of their potential' and must
            improve before the Fed can begin reducing monetary stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10. Woods Makes Caddie's Beef Jerky Golf-Bag Accessory at $54-Pound &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- At last week's U.S. PGA Tour event
            along the Georgia coast, players were treated to a Southern
            lunch of fried chicken, black-eyed peas and collard greens at
            Sea Island Resort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. Tesla's Funny Math Is Fuel for Cockroach Theories: Jonathan
            Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 15 (Bloomberg) -- Tesla Motors Inc. shareholders have
            had much to fret about lately, from a nosebleed valuation and
            sagging stock price to periodic YouTube videos of exploding
            Tesla electric cars. Here's another one for the list: Sometimes
            Tesla acts like it doesn't know what it's doing when it comes to
            financial reporting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Oysters Could Save New York From More Sandys: James S.
            Russell &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Kate Orff wants to grow oysters in
            New York's Jamaica Bay. Not for you to eat, but to save the
            shore from mighty storms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. The Secret James Bond Missed in 'Skyfall': Stephen L. Carter &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Last year, shortly after the
            excellent James Bond film 'Skyfall' was released, I asserted
            in a column that an anagram at the heart of the film suggested
            that a critical subplot had been left on the cutting-room floor.
            I received several e-mails asking why I hadn't disclosed what I
            thought I knew. The answer is that I couldn't explain the
            anagram without including several spoilers. Now that a year has
            passed since the U.S. opening (November 9, 2012), I suppose it's
            time to explain what I meant. (Warning: Those aforementioned
            spoilers are below!) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. MacBooks, Mavericks Extend Apple's Universe: Rich Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- When the same company controls the
            hardware, software and services, it's called 'owning the
            stack.' And no one does it like Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Handcuffs for Fed Tighten With Fiscal Profligacy: Caroline
            Baum &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Every time I see references in
            academic papers to 'fiscal dominance,' I envision a gigantic
            dominatrix, whip in hand, staring down at the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Yellen Testifies at Confirmation Hearing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) ' Janet Yellen, the nominee for
            chairman of the Federal Reserve, speaks about the central bank's

        <headline>Goldman Said to Draw Interest in Metro Warehousing Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
            bought aluminum warehouse firm Metro International Trade
            Services LLC in 2010, has received inquiries from potential
            buyers after the London Metal Exchange imposed new rules on how
            storage facilities operate, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn't engaged in a formal sale process, said
            the person, who requested anonymity because the talks are
            private and didn't identify the prospective purchasers. Gary Cohn, president of the New York-based company,
            told CNBC in July
            that it was allowed to own Metro for 10 years and that it would
            sell the business at 'an appropriate time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The LME, the world's biggest industrial-metals marketplace,
            changed its rules earlier this month to speed up withdrawals
            from warehoused stockpiles amid consumer complaints that
            prompted scrutiny from U.S. regulators. The changes will affect
            depots where waiting times exceed 50 calendar days, a broader
            group than the original proposal that pertained to sites where
            waits were longer than 100 days. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs received interest from private-equity firms
            and international commodity companies in potentially buying
            Metro after the rule change eliminated some uncertainty in the
            warehouse industry, the person said. The bank, the fifth-biggest
            in the U.S. by assets, may not pursue a sale in the near future,
            the person said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU), the
            second-largest U.S. life insurer, hired Robert Cignarella as co-head of global leveraged finance from
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cignarella will join in January and help oversee more than
            $33 billion, including bank loans and high-yield bonds in the
            U.S. and Europe, the Newark, New Jersey-based company said today
            in a statement. He'll work withPaul Appleby, a managing
            director and the current head of Prudential Fixed Income's
            leveraged finance team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Rob's more than 20 years of experience and insight in
            leveraged finance will be a valuable addition in leading our
            investment management efforts,' Appleby said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer John Strangfeld, 59, is bolstering
            Prudential's asset-management businesses to expand fee income, a
            strategy also pursued by rivals including MetLife Inc. (MET) and
            Principal Financial Group Inc. Prudential Fixed Income had about
            $397 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30, compared
            with $232 billion at the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loans to junk-rated companies in the U.S. are on pace to
            exceed $1 trillion this year, a level not seen before the
            financial crisis. The boom is being fueled by lenders and
            investors seeking to boost returns as the Federal Reserve keeps
            interest rates at about zero for a fifth year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Seeks to Halt Singapore Tycoon Yen-Real Lawsuit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit asked a court to halt Singapore tycoon Oei Hong Leong's lawsuit
            over losses after he was allegedly misled into making leveraged trades that the yen would fall against the
            Brazilian real. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International said in a Nov. 6 filing with the Singapore
            High Court that proceedings should be suspended in favor of private and confidential arbitration. Court
            papers detailing reasons aren't publicly accessible. A closed hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oei, who in 2009 settled a claim against Citigroup Inc. over S$1 billion ($804 million) in trading
            losses, accused Goldman Sachs in his Sept. 20 lawsuit of making fraudulent representations that the real was
            a stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar. He's seeking $31.7 million in trading losses, plus
            interest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will defend Oei's lawsuit, which is without merit, Hong
            Kong-based spokesman Edward Naylor said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oei will challenge Goldman Sachs's
            arbitration bid, his lawyer, Siraj Omar, said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Oei's position is that the Singapore
            court is the proper place to decide the claim, especially since the misrepresentation that he is complaining
            about occurred in Singapore,' Omar said. 'He sees no basis for moving this to confidential arbitration in
            London.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says 5.5% Jobless Best to Boost Participation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve should lower its jobless-rate threshold for raising interest rates to 5.5
            percent if it takes both the unemployment and participation rates into account, keeping its main interest
            rate lower for longer, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The analysis
            updates a study Goldman Sachs published earlier this month by factoring in the labor force participation
            rate rather than simply addressing unemployment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Taking into account adverse supply
            side effects -- by aiming to normalize both the unemployment and participation rates -- strengthens the case
            for lowering the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold,' economists led by Jan Hatzius say in the note written
            by Sven Jari Stehn and dated Nov. 19. 'Our small model suggests that the most desirable unemployment
            threshold in this case would be around 5.5 percent.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study builds on papers
            presented by Fed officials earlier in November. William English, head of the Division of Monetary Affairs,
            wrote that the strategy of not raising interest rates if unemployment is above 6.5 percent has provided
            useful stimulus and suggested an even lower threshold could be effective. David Wilcox, the research and
            statistics chief, argued for loose policy amid contained inflation expectations and high labor slack, noting
            that 'participation appears to have moved noticeably lower.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman's previous
            analysis, which looked at English's work, found that a threshold of 6 percent would deliver 'the best
            combination of a stronger recovery and modest inflation.' The update takes into account 'the supply side
            mechanisms of the Wilcox paper,' the economists wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the Fed tried to address the
            entire employment picture by taking into account a measure of the so-called participation gap, the Fed's
            policy rate would be on hold until mid-2016, they found. In that case, a 5.5 percent jobless rate threshold
            is best, the Goldman Sachs economists wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our analysis suggests that taking into
            account that weak aggregate demand might have adverse effects on labor supply strengthens the case for
            lowering the 6.5% unemployment threshold,' they said in the paper. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Says Currency Unit Didn't Post Third-Quarter Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall
            Street firm with the biggest revenue decline last quarter, said
            its currency trading business didn't incur a loss in the period
            as the bank sought to clarify a figure in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs did not suffer a loss in our currencies
            business in the third quarter,' Michael DuVally, a spokesman
            for the New York-based bank, said today in an e-mailed
            statement. 'Gains or losses in one product type frequently
            offset gains or losses in other product types.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reuters reported earlier today that the bank posted more
            than $1 billion in market-making losses on currency products in
            the third quarter, citing U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission and Federal Reserve filings. Goldman Sachs said in
            its quarterly SEC filing on Nov. 7 that the figure isn't
            representative of how it manages the business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The filing discloses market-making revenue from different
            products. Each product's revenue can include gains or losses
            that are booked in another business, such as a commodity deal
            that's hedged with currency swaps. The figure also excludes
            trading commissions and net interest income. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mortgages, Commodities &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the SEC asked Goldman Sachs to disclose
            how much products such as mortgages and commodities contribute
            to its trading revenue to give investors more clarity on how the
            firm makes most of its money. The SEC completed its review after
            the firm responded that it would give more 'qualitative
            disclosure' and already had provided the market-making figures
            by product. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Alstom Said to Mandate Goldman for Preheaters Unit Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Alstom SA, the French builder of trains and power plants, has mandated Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
            explore a sale of its air preheaters and gas-gas heaters unit, according to people familiar with the matter.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The business may draw interest from private-equity companies, said two of the people,
            who declined to be identified as the plan is not public. The unit has annual sales of between 400 million
            euros and 500 million euros ($671 million), said two of the people. More information will be sent to
            potential bidders in coming weeks, they said. Representatives for Alstom and Goldman Sachs declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The products, made in the German cities of Mannheim and Dusseldorf, are used by
            power plants and boiler companies, according to Alstom's website. While air preheaters are directly involved
            in the power-generation process, gas-gas heaters are used in the flue gas cleaning process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alstom,
            based in Levallois-Perret near Paris, said this month it will deepen a cost-cutting drive and sell as much
            as 2 billion euros in assets by the end of 2014 as it seeks to sustain profit. Possible disposals include a
            minority stake in train and railway-equipment unit Alstom Transport that may attract industry and
            private-equity buyers, it said Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Venture Plans &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alstom shares
            reversed losses and gained as much as 1 percent in Paris intraday trading after Bloomberg News reported the
            potential sale of the preheaters and gas-gas heaters unit. The stock was up 0.5 percent as of 11:22 a.m.,
            valuing the company at 8.3 billion euros. Before today, the stock had dropped 11 percent this year, while
            the French benchmark CAC 40 index gained 17 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Alstom and China's
            Shanghai Electric Group Co. announced a plan to create a joint venture to sell boilers for coal-fired power
            plants and spare parts for services. The talks about that venture are 'in a coma,' Alstom Chief Executive
            Officer Patrick Kron said this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company also plans to reduce costs by as much
            as 1.5 billion euros by April 2016 as demand for gas turbines weakens and pricing pressure hurts profit from
            onshore wind turbines and power-transmission gear. The manufacturer plans to cut 1,300 jobs, mainly in
            Europe. The reductions will affect the information-technology department and the boiler unit, and may be
            extended to other operations if needed, Kron has said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moody's Investors Service in June
            cut Alstom's long-term credit rating by one level to Baa3, the lowest investment grade. Standard Poor's,
            which gives Alstom debt its second-lowest investment rating of BBB, has said it may make a similar move.

        <headline>Goldman Sees at Least 15% Losses for Gold, Iron Ore</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gold, iron ore, soybeans and copper will probably drop at least 15 percent next year as commodities
            face increased downside risks even as economic growth in the U.S. accelerates, according to Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risks are strongest for iron ore and follow increases in supplies,
            analysts including Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report yesterday that identified the New York-based bank's top
            10 market themes for the coming year. Price pressures will mostly become visible later in 2014, the analysts
            wrote, forecasting that bullion, copper and soybeans will decline to the lowest levels since 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities tracked by the Standard Poor's GSCI Index lost 4.7 percent this year, led by corn as
            supplies surged, and precious metals on expectations the Federal Reserve will taper stimulus. Goldman
            described the forecast losses for iron ore, gold, soybeans and copper as significant, and said that they
            could help weaken currencies in producing countries, including the Australian dollar and South African rand.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Last year, we pointed to the ongoing shift in our commodity views, ultimately towards
            downside price risk,' the analysts including Currie wrote. 'The impact of supply responses to the period of
            extraordinary price pressure continues to flow through the system.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Seek Buyer for Uranium Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) put its
            uranium trading unit up for sale as prices for the radioactive
            metal fall and regulatory scrutiny of banks' commodity
            activities increases, a person briefed on the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The person asked not to be identified because the decision
            hasn't been made public. SparkSpread, an online energy
            publication, reported the move earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prices for uranium have declined since Japan's Fukushima
            nuclear disaster, which eroded demand for the metal as nations
            shuttered reactors. Banks from JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) to UBS AG
            have cut their price outlooks for next year as the radiation
            leaks fan speculation that the restart of Japan's idled plants
            will take longer than expected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is reviewing companies including
            Goldman Sachs as U.S. lawmakers and regulators raise concerns
            that banks might abuse their various roles in physical
            commodities markets for their own benefit, or that the
            businesses pose risks to the firms' financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank received inquiries from potential buyers for its
            aluminum warehousing company, Metro International Trade Services
            LLC, a person briefed on the matter said this week. New York-based Goldman Sachs bought Metro as a merchant
            banking
            investment in 2010 and must sell it by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees S&amp;amp;P 500 Falling 10% Next Year Before Rally to 1,900</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's 500 Index will
            probably fall 10 percent in the next 12 months before rebounding
            to end the year at 1,900, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 1,900 forecast from the New York-based firm implies
            about a 5 percent advance from today's level. The 25 months
            since the SP 500 (SPX)'s last 10 percent drop is the longest stretch
            without such a decline since 2007, according to SP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It will be less smooth sailing,' David Kostin, the
            bank's chief U.S. equity strategist, said on Bloomberg
            Television's 'Market Makers' program. 'The likelihood is we
            will have something that will prompt a reduction -- a retreat in
            the market. But overall the market should be rising, and that's
            because the U.S. economy will be getting better.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kostin predicts the SP 500 will reach 2,100 by the end of
            2015 and 2,200 by the end of 2016. He said he favors technology,
            industrial and consumer discretionary companies because they
            will benefit the most from an improving economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast U.S. economic
            growth will accelerate to 2.6 percent next year and 3 percent in
            2015, compared with a 1.7 percent expansion in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors should buy shares of companies that are
            increasing capital spending or repurchasing stock, he said. He's
            also bullish on firms that have above-average operating
            leverage, a measure of how well a company can control fixed and
            variable costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'All these themes are about taking advantage of the
            economy improving,' Kostin said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Iron Ore Seen Slumping From Westpac to Goldman on Supply</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore will probably drop 19
            percent by the end of the year as demand slows and supply
            increases, Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) said, joining Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. in forecasting declining prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore may fall to $110 a ton by the end of the year, Justin Smirk, the second-most-accurate
            industrial metals forecaster
            tracked by Bloomberg over the past eight quarters, said in a
            report today. Prices may rebound to about $140 a ton in mid-2014
            before dropping back to $110 in September, he said. Goldman said
            last week the steelmaking ingredient was among commodities that
            may decline at least 15 percent next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore climbed to a two-month high on Nov. 6 as China,
            the biggest buyer, boosted stockpiles to the highest level in a
            year. Banks from Goldman to UBS AG expect that supply expansions
            led by Australian producers will push the seaborne market into
            surplus next year. The pace of China's economic growth may slow
            to 7.4 percent in 2014 from 7.6 percent this year, according to
            economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are now looking for prices to ease by the end of the
            year, as demand slows and supply picks up a little more,'
            Smirk, a senior economist at Westpac, said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
            port of Tianjin was unchanged at $136.50 a dry ton yesterday,
            according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices climbed to $137.10 on
            Nov. 6, the highest since Sept. 5, paring this year's loss to
            5.8 percent. Iron ore for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity
            Exchange rose 0.9 percent to 941 yuan ($154) a ton today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Global Surplus &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman said last month that prices will average $130 a ton
            this quarter and $117 a ton in the first quarter of 2014 from
            $133 in the three months ended Sept. 30. Surging output in
            Australia, the biggest exporter, will swell the global surplus
            to 154 million tons, from 24 million tons in 2013, UBS AG says. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The glut may not emerge until the second half of 2014,
            according to Morgan Stanley. Supply in the seaborne market will
            fall 25 million tons short of demand in the first half, before a
            49 million-ton surplus emerges in the final six months, it said
            Oct. 7. Prices will average $125 this quarter, $130 in the next
            and $120 in the three months through June, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stockpiles in China were 77.86 million tons on Nov. 22, the
            highest since Nov. 30, 2012, according to Beijing Antaike
            Development Co. Inventories climbed 18 percent after slumping in
            March to the lowest since 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto Group, which expects continued demand for raw
            materials from China, plans to expand output in Australia's
            Pilbara region to 360 million tons from 290 million tons.
            Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) is tripling its capacity in the
            Pilbara to 155 million tons. The first ore from BHP Billiton
            Ltd. (BHP)'s Jimblebar expansion in Western Australia arrived six
            months early. BHP is the biggest mining company followed by Rio. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Buy China, Russia Stocks on Valuation to Reform</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
            buying Chinese (SHCOMP) and Russian stocks as a pick up in growth in
            developed countries and government reforms boost prospects for
            the 'least-expensive' emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman upgraded equities in the two countries to
            overweight, the equivalent of buy, from market weight, saying
            Chinese banks and Russian energy companies could experience
            'modest valuation expansion,' according to a report today. The
            New York-based bank kept Korea and Mexico at overweight. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Micex Index (INDEXCF) in Moscow trades at 4.3 times projected 12-month earnings, while the
            multiple for the Shanghai Composite
            Index is 8.6, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
            compares with 10.5 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
            China, the world's second-largest economy, and Russia, the
            largest global energy exporter, are 'relatively insulated'
            from concern about Federal Reserve stimulus tapering, which may
            start around March 2014, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Efficiency of capital allocation and the treatment of
            minority shareholders 'are improving,' analysts including
            Christopher Eoyang said. 'In Russia, we feel the market is
            over-focused on the importance of the price of oil, and
            unwilling to credit the effects of various reform programs, the
            drive for greater efficiency' and a potential increase of
            energy exports to Asia, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Blackstone Said to Abandon Madrid Home Auction</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bidders including Blackstone Group
            LP (BX) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) dropped out of an auction of
            1,458 rental homes in Spain, leaving the properties unsold, two
            people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madrid's regional government received no binding offers for
            the portfolio comprising 22 developments in and around the
            Spanish capital by the Nov. 22 deadline, according to the
            people, who asked not to be named because the information is
            private. At least seven companies expressed an interest in
            buying the properties, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three years of government austerity, unemployment at 26
            percent and subdued mortgage lending are forcing more Spaniards
            to consider renting rather than buying homes. It's also
            prompting foreign funds to invest in the country's unsold
            residential properties, which may total 1.3 million units,
            according to Idealista.com, Spain's largest real estate website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the regional government of Madrid wasn't
            immediately available for comment. Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman
            for Goldman Sachs in London, and Andrew Dowler, a spokesman for
            Blackstone, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asking Price &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The minimum asking price for the homes, which are 94
            percent occupied with a delinquency rate of 21 percent, was 67.2
            million euros ($91 million), the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Home prices have fallen by an average of 40 percent since
            the market's peak in 2007, according to Fotocasa.es and the IESE
            business school. Rents in Madrid have fallen 19 percent since
            June 2008. In Barcelona, Spain's second-largest city, they've
            dropped 24 percent, according to data compiled by Idealista.com. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world's largest private-equity firm, which
            has spent $7.5 billion buying 40,000 homes in the U.S., agreed
            in July to purchase 18 apartment blocks from the city of Madrid
            for 125.5 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Azora Capital SL, a Madrid-based private-equity firm with 2.3 billion euros of
            assets under management,
            agreed in August to pay almost 20 percent more than the minimum
            asking price for 32 social-housing developments sold by the
            capital's regional government. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spain's bad bank, known as Sareb, failed to attract high
            enough bids in its first sale of commercial real estate and will
            cut the size of the portfolio offered to make it easier to sell,
            three people familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Currency-Trading Definition Shows Disclosure Gap</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;What's the difference between
            trading currency products and currency trading? More than $1
            billion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank said last week that it didn't have a
            third-quarter loss in currency trading. That followed a report
            by Reuters on Goldman Sachs's Nov. 7 Securities and Exchange
            Commission filing, which shows a $1.32 billion loss from market-making in currency products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The disconnect stems from the fact that the biggest U.S.
            banks don't provide a revenue breakdown for units that make up
            their equity- and fixed-income trading divisions, which reap
            more than $70 billion a year. An SEC requirement that banks give
            some specifics on those businesses resulted in disclosures that
            firms such as Goldman Sachs, which gets more than half its
            revenue from trading, said lack meaningful context. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you're trying to figure out the profitability of
            different lines of business, I don't know how you effectively do
            that,' said Edward Siedle, a former SEC attorney and president
            of Ocean Ridge, Florida-based Benchmark Financial Services Inc.
            'The commission needs to be careful not to require a disclosure
            scheme that is just as likely to be misleading as it is to be
            revealing,' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to BofA Pitch Venezuela Deals to Drum Up Dollars</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Bank of
            America Corp. (BAC) are among Wall Street firms that offered deals to
            help Venezuela obtain U.S. dollars amid a plunge in the nation's
            foreign reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A swap proposed by Goldman Sachs would provide $1.68
            billion in cash and be backed by $1.85 billion of the central
            bank's gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News show. Bank of
            America said it could be an intermediary for $3 billion in
            payments to firms seeking U.S. dollars, documents show. Neither
            deal has been completed, a government official with direct
            knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity because the
            talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dollars are becoming scarce in Venezuela, limiting the
            supply of products from medicine to toilet paper in a nation
            that imports about three-quarters of goods it consumes. Foreign
            reserves dropped 28 percent this year, touching a nine-year low
            of $20.7 billion this month, largely because 70 percent of the
            assets are in gold. The metal plunged 26 percent in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fact you have dollar shortages is symptomatic of an
            economy that's completely broken down,' Robert Abad, who helps
            oversee $53 billion in emerging-market debt at Western Asset
            Management Co., said yesterday in a telephone interview from
            Pasadena, California. 'This is something that's just incredibly
            unnecessary, very unfortunate, and the victim of all of this is
            the real economy, real people.' &lt;/p&gt;

            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to sell a
            controlling stake in Corpbanca (CORPBANC), according to two people familiar
            with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) is one of the banks they have
            approached, said one of the two people, who asked not to be
            named because the negotiations are private. Santiago-based
            Corpbanca has a market value of $4.22 billion. Saieh and his
            family directly and indirectly own 76 percent of the bank,
            according to its most recent annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Itau's chief executive officer, Roberto Setubal, told
            analysts on an earning conference call on Nov. 12 that Chile is
            a priority market and that the bank is considering acquisitions
            in Latin America. Neither Corpbanca nor its controler have made
            any agreement to sell all or part of the bank, chief executive
            officer Fernando Massu said today in a statement to the stock
            exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a spokesman from Goldman Sachs in New
            York, declined to comment on the transaction, as did Kerrie
            McHugh, a spokeswoman from Bank of America in New York. Itau
            also declined to comment, according to an official who asked not
            to be named in keeping with company policy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Share Rally &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corpbanca's shares leaped 7.9 percent to 6.60 pesos today
            in Santiago, bringing their gain to 40 percent since reaching a
            low of 4.727 pesos on Aug. 28. The stock is up 3.6 percent so
            far this year, while the IPSA index of Chile's most-traded stock
            has fallen 13.1 percent. Corpbanca's bonds due 2018 have
            returned 0.7 percent this month, beating losses in bonds of
            Banco de Chile, Banco Santander Chile and Banco de Credito
            Inversiones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chilean securities regulation stipulates that a bidder must
            present a public offer to all shareholders of a listed company
            if it's seeking effective control of the target, or if the buyer
            increases an existing stake above two thirds of all shares. If a
            bidder is seeking to buy a non-listed company whose assets are
            mostly stakes in a listed firm, the law will also require it to
            bid for the publicly traded unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh completed the investment of an additional $300
            million in his supermarket chain SMU SA last week after losses
            at the company led it to break debt covenants. SMU's $300
            million of bonds due 2020 have lost 37 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asset Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh sold other assets as he sought to fund the cash
            injection into SMU. Inversiones La Construccion SA said on Oct.
            1 it would pay $170 million in cash and assumed debt for a 67
            percent stake in Corp Group Vida Chile SA, the holding company
            through which Saieh controls two insurers. He also sold 31 bank
            branches for $83 million to Independencia Rentas Inmobiliarias,
            a real estate fund that will lease the space back to Corpbanca. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;El Mostrador website reported today that Corpbanca was in
            talks with four banks, including Itau, over a possible merger
            that would enable Saieh to retain some control over the bank,
            citing a document drawn up by Bank of America. The other banks
            are Banco de Credito e Inversiones, Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) and
            Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, the website said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Tobin, a spokesman for BBVA in Madrid, declined to
            comment. Calls to a press official at BCI weren't immediately
            returned. Bank of Nova Scotia doesn't comment on rumors,
            spokeswoamn Paula Cufre said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombian-born Saieh, who has a doctorate in economics from
            the University of Chicago and whose family immigrated to Chile
            when he was three years old, built CorpBanca into Chile's fifth
            biggest bank by assets. The bank's shares have tripled since the
            company went public in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saieh now sits on the board of his alma mater, alongside
            Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Brady Dougan, and in his spare time
            collects Italian renaissance art. Last year he outbid the Los
            Angeles County Museum of Art to buy Girolamo Romanino's Christ
            Carrying the Cross for $4.6 million, according to artnet.com.
            Saieh is a member of the European paintings visiting committee
            of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He stood down from the board of Corpbanca in February of
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fed Said to Review Commodities at Goldman, Morgan Stanley</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has expanded its
            scrutiny of banks' physical commodities operations to encompass
            businesses run by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS)
            that Congress had previously authorized. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed is examining all legal and regulatory exemptions
            that allow banks to participate in the commodities markets, said
            a person briefed on the process who asked not to be named
            because the review is confidential. The appraisal, intended to
            minimize potential risks to the financial system, widened since
            the Fed said in July that it's reconsidering its landmark 2003
            decision to grant some lenders, such as Citigroup Inc. (C) and
            JPMorgan Chase Co., permission to expand into raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. law restricts banks from owning non-financial
            businesses unless they get special exemptions. Goldman Sachs and
            Morgan Stanley were the two biggest U.S. securities firms until
            they converted into banks in 2008. A 1999 law 'grandfathers'
            any commodities operations they had before Sept. 30, 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The way I read the statute, all commodities activities
            are grandfathered forever, subject to appropriate risk-management controls,' said Randy Guynn, head of the
            financial
            institutions group at law firm Davis Polk Wardwell LLP, whose
            clients include Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

            The Federal Reserve is conducting the review while U.S. lawmakers and regulators raise concerns that banks
            might abuse their various roles in commodities markets, such as by coordinating their trading platforms and
            ownership of materials or energy firms to influence prices and profit. Close

        <headline>Greenhill Hires Ex-Goldman Executive Wainstein for Brazil</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Greenhill Co. (GHL) hired Daniel Wainstein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s former head of
            investment-banking in Brazil, to open an office in Sao Paulo, the New York-based advisory firm's first South
            American branch. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein, 43, will build a team able to advise major
            Brazilian companies on global transactions, he said today in a
            statement from Greenhill. Wainstein left Goldman Sachs in June
            after 13 years, including 11 in Brazil, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greenhill is expanding into Brazil as some international
            banks pull back. Goldman Sachs halted an expansion there after
            announcing plans in April to hire 50 people for the region. UBS
            AG, based in Zurich, and London-based Barclays Plc have been
            reducing staff in Brazil as competition with local lenders
            intensifies. Economic growth decelerated last year to 0.9
            percent, capping the slowest two years in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If a region is going through some cyclical economic
            challenges, it can be an even more opportune time for us to
            recruit,' Greenhill Chief Executive Officer Scott Bok, 54, said
            today in a separate e-mailed statement. 'Brazil will certainly
            have its ups and downs, just like the U.S. market does, but
            Brazil is clearly a large market that will see significant
            economic growth over the long term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Announced mergers and acquisitions involving companies in
            Brazil declined 13 percent to $39.7 billion this year from the
            same period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as
            the outlook for economic growth worsened and volatility in
            equity and exchange-rates markets led to some deals being
            postponed. That's the slowest pace for the period since 2007,
            the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Comparisons &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brazil's benchmark Ibovespa index has lost about 13 percent
            this year, compared with a 19 percent gain in the Standard
            Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein was appointed chairman of Brazil investment
            banking at New York-based Goldman Sachs in April 2012, when
            Antonio Pereira and Fabio Bicudo were named co-chief operating
            officers. Before working at Goldman Sachs, he spent two years at
            Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in New York, Greenhill said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wainstein was one of only two Goldman Sachs partners who
            are Brazilian. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Berkshire Uses Goldman Warrant to Get $2.1 Billion Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
            Inc. (BRK/A) will get 13.1 million shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            after exercising a warrant tied to a 2008 investment in the Wall
            Street bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares will be delivered on Oct. 4 to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, according to a Business
            Wire statement today
            from the bank. The stake is valued at about $2.1 billion based
            on the $159 closing price today of Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Berkshire becomes the seventh-largest shareholder of
            Goldman Sachs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett,
            Berkshire's chairman and chief executive officer, also got a $5
            billion preferred stake for the original investment, which
            Goldman redeemed in 2011 at a 10 percent premium. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Berkshire can't sell its shares until after the investment
            bank reports third-quarter results this month. Buffett and
            Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein have said that Berkshire
            intends to remain a long-term investor. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nomura Joins Goldman Among Managers of Japan Post's IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. are among firms selected to lead the initial
            public offering of Japan Post Holdings Co. as the government
            sells the country's biggest savings institution. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Ministry of Finance also chose Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan
            Stanley (MS) Securities Co. and JPMorgan Chase Co. as the global
            coordinators for the sale of the state-owned postal, banking and
            insurance giant as soon as next year. Daiwa Securities Group
            Inc., Citigroup Inc., UBS AG (UBSN) and four other brokerages will also
            arrange the IPO, the ministry said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction could become one of Japan's biggest IPOs as
            the government implements privatization plans conceived by
            former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's administration in the
            previous decade. Firms leading the offering stand to reap the
            highest fees by advising the ministry on how and when to sell
            the shares in Japan and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a gigantic deal,' said Kazumi Tanaka, an IPO
            analyst at DZH Financial Research Inc. in Tokyo. 'Obtaining the
            mandate is lucrative because of the large fees and the
            additional share sales and deals that would follow.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mizuho Securities Co. (8411) and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. were
            also selected to work on the IPO, along with Tokai Tokyo
            Financial Holdings Inc. and Okasan Securities Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>U.S. Oil Output May Slow If WTI Drops Below $90: Goldman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude may be
            nearing a price floor because a move below $90 a barrel would
            prompt some U.S. producers to reduce drilling, according to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WTI futures traded near $92 a barrel today after plunging
            13 percent in the three months ended yesterday, the U.S.
            benchmark's biggest quarterly drop in more than two years.
            Prices are close to a level that would make production
            unprofitable for some companies in higher-cost places such as
            North Dakota, Goldman's head of commodities research, Jeff Currie, said in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'U.S. producers may lay down rigs and slow production if
            WTI keeps falling below $90,' Currie said in an interview
            during the World Commodities Week conference. The potential for
            oil prices to fall further is also 'limited' because of
            threats to supply, particularly in Libya, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs estimates that WTI will trade at about $90 a
            barrel in three months, while Brent, the European benchmark,
            rebounds to $100. Brent traded at about $95 a barrel on the ICE
            Futures Europe exchange today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The downside is limited, unless the economic situation
            outside the U.S. deteriorates further,' Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Disappointing economic growth in China would mean that
            Brent might miss the target, Currie said. Concern that China is
            slowing, coupled with the strengthening U.S. dollar, sparked a
            selloff across commodities yesterday that pulled oil lower, he
            said. WTI fell 3.6 percent yesterday to $91.16 a barrel, the
            biggest drop since November 2012, according to New York
            Mercantile Exchange data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More Bearish &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The picture's a tad more bearish,' Currie said. 'Our
            baseline view is an acceleration in demand into 2015 and
            slightly lower production. My conviction in our baseline view is
            waning with recent macro data.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's manufacturing remained subdued last month as the
            world's second-largest economy was weighed down by a property
            slump. The government's Purchasing Managers' Index (CPMINDX) was at 51.1
            in September, the same as August's reading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A pullback in manufacturing, declining industrial profits,
            and factory-output growth at a five-year low point to a
            deepening economic slowdown. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
            predict China will expand 7 percent in 2015, the slowest pace
            since 1990. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Supply Threats &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The political situation in Libya is one of the most
            tenuous we've seen since unrest first erupted,' Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The holder of Africa's biggest oil reserves remains divided
            politically even as its production has tripled to 780,000
            barrels a day last month from 250,000 a day in May, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Its internationally recognized
            government shifted to the eastern city of al-Bayda and a
            different administration allied with Islamist militias has
            seized control of the capital, Tripoli. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The nation's production, currently at about 900,000 barrels
            a day, was disrupted last month by protests at the Gialo field
            and a rocket attack that damaged the Zawiya refinery, according
            to Mohamed Elharari, a spokesman at National Oil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You lose some of Libya, China shows an acceleration, you
            get a slight reduction in Saudi Arabian production, and the
            market would be back up to $100,' Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;

            8 billion-krone ($1.46 billion) stake in Dong Energy A/S,
            Denmark's largest utility, which is shoring up its balance sheet
            after losing money on failed natural gas bets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase will give New York-based Goldman a 19 percent
            stake in Dong, which is controlled by the government, the
            utility said late yesterday. Danish pension funds ATP and PFA
            will pay 2.2 billion kroner and 800 million kroner to buy stakes
            of about 5 percent and 2 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denmark's government, which pulled a planned initial public
            offering of Dong in 2008, said in February it will sell a stake
            in the Skaerbaek, Denmark-based company as writedowns soared.
            Dong yesterday said the parties have agreed to seek an initial
            public offering when conditions 'are right.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new investors have an option to sell their holdings
            back to the government should an IPO not be completed before the
            release of Dong's 2017 financial report, according to today's
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman plans to 'grow the business and provide
            environmentally friendly energy and infrastructure for European
            markets,' Andrew Wolff, head of Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking
            Division in Europe, said in the statement. Goldman is buying
            the stake via funds managed by Wolff's division. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tata Consultancy Rises on Goldman Rating Upgrade: Mumbai Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) rose
            the most in a month in Mumbai trading after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) upgraded its rating, while New York City awarded the Indian
            company naming rights to its annual marathon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy advanced as much as 4.2 percent to 2,030
            rupees and traded at 2,024 rupees as of 11:12 a.m., headed for
            the biggest gain since Aug. 30. The SP BSE Sensex (SENSEX) climbed 1.3
            percent and the SP BSE India Information Technology Index, or
            BSET, rose 2.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs upgraded India's largest software exporter to
            buy from neutral, citing rising revenue compared with its peers
            amid an increase in global spending on information technology
            services. Economic recoveries in the U.S. and Europe, along with
            a tumbling rupee that boosts repatriated revenue from overseas
            sales, have triggered a 41 percent jump in the BSET this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy 'is well positioned to record sector
            leading revenue in an improving demand scenario,' Goldman Sachs
            said in a note dated yesterday. The firm revised its 12-month
            price estimate for Tata Consultancy to 2,300 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy also entered into an eight-year
            partnership with the New York Road Runners to serve as lead
            sponsor of the annual New York City Marathon beginning in 2014,
            the company said in an e-mailed statement. Tata Consultancy has
            served as a technology consultant for the Road Runners since
            2010 and previously developed mobile applications used by
            runners and spectators for the 2013 half marathon in New York,
            which will be followed by a new application for forthcoming
            races, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We aspire to make the TCS New York City Marathon a more
            technologically-enriched and socially engaged experience for all
            its participants and fans across the world, using our core
            technology skills,' Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chief executive
            officer of Tata Consultancy, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Make $1.5 Million Error in Ford Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) mistakenly
            added about $1.5 million of interest costs to a Ford Motor Co. (F)
            bond sale last week by using the wrong Treasury note as a
            benchmark for the security, according to two people with
            knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As compensation, Ford was charged a lower underwriting fee
            for the offering of $1 billion of five-year, 2.875 percent notes
            from its finance unit, said one of the people, who asked not to
            be identified because the information is private. The automaker
            paid 0.1 percentage point less in fees than in two previous
            sales of similar-maturity debt, regulatory filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the sixth-largest underwriter of corporate
            bonds worldwide this year, took Ford public in 1956 and a former
            executive at the bank, John Thornton, sits on the carmaker's
            board. Such an error by the New York-based bank is rare across
            capital markets, said AllianceBernstein Holding LP (AB)'s Ashish Shah, who wasn't involved in the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I can't recall the last time something like this
            happened,' said Shah, the head of global credit at New York-based AllianceBernstein, which manages $435
            billion. 'It's a
            reminder that this is a human-led process,' he said. 'It's
            probably something that won't be repeated for a long time at the
            firm.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Acapulco Vacancies Spurring Rate Cut: Mexico Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Twin hurricanes that struck Mexico
            last month are bolstering traders' conviction that the central
            bank will lower borrowing costs for a third time this year to
            alleviate any damage to economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Interest-rate swaps yesterday indicated a 76 percent chance
            that Mexico's central bank will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25
            percentage point in the next three months to 3.5 percent. That's
            the highest odds since the eve of policy makers' half-point
            reduction in March. Sixteen of 20 analysts in a Sept. 20 survey
            by Citigroup Inc.'s Banamex unit predict at least one more cut
            this year, versus just three who anticipated the quarter-point
            reduction on Sept. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel left at least 157 people dead,
            with flooding that decimated crops such as tomatoes and chili
            peppers while disrupting deliveries and emptying hotels in
            Acapulco. While the destruction may push up inflation as food
            prices rise, it will pressure the central bank to cut borrowing
            costs to bolster an economy already growing at the slowest pace
            since 2009, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The economy was already debilitated, and it was hammered
            by this shock,' Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin America
            economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, said in a telephone
            interview. 'It makes sense for the central bank to ease more
            after this devastation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Easing Potential &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before the hurricanes, Ramos expected the central bank to
            lower its 3.75 percent rate by 0.25 percentage point on Oct. 25
            to a record-low 3.5 percent. The storms opened the door to a
            half-point cut this month or another reduction to 3.25 percent
            in December, he said. President Enrique Pena Nieto said the
            storms were the most intense on record. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ricardo Medina Macias, a spokesman for Banco de Mexico,
            didn't respond to e-mail and voice messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Manuel and Ingrid drove more than 50,000 people from their
            homes and stranded 40,000 more in the resort city of Acapulco,
            including tourists from Mexico City who were celebrating over
            the country's Independence Day holiday weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While most Acapulco hotels were spared from damage,
            occupancy rates have declined due to the closing of the highway
            connecting the resort city to the nation's capital, according to
            Armando Uribe Valle, president of the Mexican Association of
            Hotels and Motels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vacant Rooms &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Acapulco's 18,000 hotel rooms registered with the
            association have been about 20 percent occupied in the weeks
            since the storms hit, Uribe said. The dropoff already has cost
            $19 million to $23 million in lost room charges, and demand
            could remain below normal for as long as two months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't remember it ever being this bad in terms of
            occupancy,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three of the 14 highways nationwide that were closed by the
            storms remain blocked, Communications and Transportation
            Minister Gerardo Ruiz Esparza said at an event with Pena Nieto
            on Oct. 1. The government is aiming to have the infrastructure
            of Michoacan, a grower of produce including limes and one of the
            states hardest hit by Manuel, restored within four months, Ruiz
            Esparza said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank, led by Governor Agustin Carstens, cut the
            key rate to 3.75 percent on Sept. 6, surprising 19 of 20
            economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Split Decision &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank was split in its decision, with two
            members voting to maintain rates and wait until the Federal
            Reserve clarified its plan for $85 billion monthly stimulus
            program that has fueled demand for emerging-market assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That was nine days before the storms hit, and the Fed on
            Sept. 18 said it would refrain from paring the stimulus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed announcement strengthened the peso and increased
            the chances for another rate cut, according to Credit Suisse
            Group AG's chief Mexico economist, Alonso Cervera. In a Sept. 26
            report he cut his forecast for this year's growth in gross
            domestic product to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, the economy contracted by 0.7
            percent from the prior three months, the first quarter-over-quarter drop since 2009. The third-quarter GDP
            report isn't due
            until November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hurricanes 'have increased downside risks to GDP,'
            wrote Cervera, who expects a quarter-point cut this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although the destruction of crops may spur an increase in a
            measure of inflation that includes farm and energy prices, 'we
            do not think that the potential spike in agricultural prices
            will have implications on monetary policy,' Cervera said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Insurance Estimates &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Mexican Association of Insurance Institutions estimated
            last week that the hurricanes caused 75 billion pesos ($5.7
            billion) in damage, of which 12 billion pesos to 15 billion
            pesos will be covered by insurance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The finance ministry said Sept. 27 that about 12.5 billion
            pesos from an emergency fund have been made immediately
            available for reconstruction and another 5 billion pesos from a
            repavement fund will be directed toward storm recovery. The
            government will also work with legislators to allocate more
            spending from next year's budget to rebuilding, the ministry
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CI Banco's Jorge Gordillo says Mexico's central bank will
            keep borrowing costs unchanged because of concern the Fed will
            start to unwind the stimulus at its meeting this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Opposite Direction' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Banxico doesn't want to be going in the opposite
            direction of the Fed,' Gordillo, CI Banco's director of
            economic analysis, said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican government
            dollar bonds instead of Treasuries fell one basis point, or 0.01
            percentage point, to 208 basis points at 4 p.m. in New York,
            according to JPMorgan Chase Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
            five years with credit-default swaps rose one basis point to 121
            basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in
            exchange for the
            underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a borrower fails
            to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The peso fell 0.5 percent to 13.1735 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Benito Berber, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.,
            projects a quarter-point interest rate cut in October and says
            there's a 50 percent chance of another reduction in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you would have distributed or spread out the impact
            over 12 months, it of course would not push the central bank to
            cut,' Berber said in a telephone interview. 'Given that it's
            concentrated in a particular time when the economy was expected
            to recover after a very disappointing first half of the year, I
            think it will open the door for cuts.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Three years after returning to investment banking from the National Football League, Anthony Noto
            is tackling his biggest project yet: Twitter Inc.'s initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noto, a
            dot-com era Internet analyst, is Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s head banker on Twitter. The IPO would be
            the largest for a U.S. technology company led by Goldman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            microblogging service publicly released its IPO filing yesterday via the U.S. Securities and Exchange
            Commission, using a $1 billion placeholder amount. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter is helping Goldman Sachs
            bounce back after the investment bank was trounced by Morgan Stanley for the prime spot on social-media
            deals from LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) to Facebook Inc. (FB) Noto, who co-manages technology investment banking
            with George Lee, has helped drive new deals for New York-based Goldman Sachs since returning to his former
            employer from the NFL, where he was chief financial officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The franchise was
            floundering for a bit in the tech IPO market,' said Lise Buyer, a former Internet analyst who now runs Class
            V Group LLC, an IPO consultancy in Portola Valley, California. Now Goldman Sachs is 'clearly giving Morgan a
            run for their money,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;TCS Group Holding Plc, the owner of
            Tinkoff Credit Systems Bank, announced plans for a $750 million
            initial public offering in London, set to become this year's
            first Russian company to sell shares in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS is poised to sell between $150 million and $200 million
            in the form of global depositary receipts this quarter,
            according to a statement today from the Russian consumer lender.
            Chairman Oleg Tinkov, who owns of 61 percent of the bank, will
            sell shares, along with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Baring Vostok
            Capital Partners, Horizon Capital and Vostok Nafta, TCS Chief
            Executive Officer Oliver Hughes said on a conference call. None
            of the selling shareholders is exiting, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tinkov's offering comes after Russian coal miner
            Sibanthracite Plc (SIB) and railroad-freight carrier NTS Holding Plc
            postponed London IPO plans this year. OAO Alrosa, the world's
            biggest diamond producer by output, plans to sell a 16 percent
            stake in Moscow. TCS is seeking to benefit from Russia's growing
            consumer lending market, even as credit risk rises. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're very much an online company that enables investors
            to tap into the Russian consumer,' Hughes said today. 'We have
            a very deep reach into Russia's regions, there's enormous
            potential for growth.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;San Francisco &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's consumer-finance banks face an increase in bad
            loans in the unsecured retail lending market, Moody's Investors
            Service Inc. said on Sept. 12, noting TCS among those with
            'heightened risks.' Russian bank lending to households rose 34
            percent earlier as of Aug. 1 from a year earlier, while
            unsecured loans rose 39 percent, according to central bank data.
            That is higher than the regulator deems 'comfortable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The branchless bank of Tinkoff Credit is modeled on Capital
            One Financial Corp. (COF) in the U.S., a pioneer of card distribution
            via direct mail, which Tinkov said he encountered while living
            in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hughes said 85 percent of TCS customers live outside Moscow
            and St. Petersburg, Russia's two biggest cities. The bank had
            issued more than 3.5 million credit cards by the end of June,
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS Bank's net income in the first half of the year rose to
            $79 million, compared with $52 million in the same period a year
            earlier, it said. Total assets equaled $2.42 billion as of June
            30, with consumer deposits at $977 million and loans to
            customers at $1.95 billion, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Investor Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The London stock market is the front-runner for an IPO
            because there isn't enough liquidity in Moscow and reporting
            rules are too stringent in the U.S., Tinkov said in an interview
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think Tinkoff's IPO will trigger a lot of global
            investor interest,' Vadim Bit-Avragim, who helps manage about
            $4.4 billion at Kapital Asset Management in Moscow, said by
            phone. 'This business is closer to the consumer sector, it has
            fast growth. Tinkov is a well-known businessman, he is very
            active and his views are liked by the investment community.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS sees a 'wide investor base' for the IPO, Hughes said,
            declining to reveal if the lender has any anchor investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Sberbank CIB will be
            managing the sale, while JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Renaissance
            Capital will also be joint bookrunners, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman to Nomura Warn on Debt to Reserves Ratio: India Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Reserve Bank of India data showed the
            highest ratio of short-term external debt to currency reserves
            in more than a decade, raising alarm bells at Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $97 billion maturing in less than a year amounted to
            34.3 percent of reserves as of June 30, the highest since at
            least March 2001, RBI figures released Sept. 30 show. The ratio
            was 146.5 percent during a balance-of-payments crisis in March
            1991, according to the report's partial data for the 1990s.
            Including longer-term debt, repayments due by June 2014 total
            $170 billion, or 60 percent of reserves. Indonesia's comparable
            ratio is 55.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asia's third-largest economy faces significant risk as
            banks and companies seek to refinance global borrowings, even as
            the government acts to trim the current-account deficit, Goldman
            wrote in a Sept. 30 research note. Nomura said the slowest
            economic growth in a decade and a budget deadlock in the U.S.
            will damp inflows, further straining India's finances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect the focus to turn to India's external
            vulnerability amid a worsening global backdrop,' Sonal Varma,
            an economist at Nomura in Mumbai, said in an Oct. 1 telephone
            interview. 'The worst in terms of the quarterly current-account
            deficit is likely behind us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deficit in the broadest measure of trade was $21.8
            billion in April through June, compared with $18.1 billion in
            the previous quarter, the RBI said in a Sept. 30 statement. The
            median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a $23
            billion gap. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deficit Outlook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura predicts the widest shortfall among the largest
            emerging markets will narrow to 3 percent of gross domestic
            product in the fiscal year through March 2014 from a record 4.8
            percent the previous period. Goldman analysts Tushar Poddar in
            Mumbai and Vishal Vaibhaw in Bangalore forecast a 3.5 percent
            gap as tariff increases curb gold imports and slower growth
            limits domestic demand. GDP increased 5 percent in the year
            ended March 31, official data show, the least in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The current-account deficit will drop to 4 percent of GDP
            this fiscal year, according to the median of 14 estimates in a
            Bloomberg survey of economists. However, the shortfall in the
            government's budget will widen to 5.05 percent of GDP in the
            same period, from 4.9 percent the prior year, according to the
            median estimates in a separate survey, as Prime Minister
            Manmohan Singh boosts spending ahead of elections due by May. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Debt Outflows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global funds have cut holdings of Indian debt by $11.5
            billion to $26.9 billion since May 22, when Federal Reserve
            Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first flagged a potential paring of
            bond purchases. Since the Fed unexpectedly maintained its buying
            on Sept. 18, the figure is down $891.5 million. Foreign reserves
            fell to $277 billion in the week through Sept. 20 from $297
            billion at the end of 2012, official data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'India is one of the countries with the most challenging
            macro imbalances,' Goldman analysts including London-based
            Thomas Stolper, wrote in a Sept. 30 note to clients. 'High-frequency data on Indian capital flows indicate
            that, even after
            the dovish Fed surprise, the funding of the large Indian
            external deficit remains a challenge.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman is selling the rupee against the euro, betting it
            will weaken to 92 per euro from 83.9678 today. The Indian
            currency advanced 1.2 percent to 61.7400 per dollar today, and
            the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond fell nine basis points,
            or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.64 percent. Local markets were
            shut yesterday for a public holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fed Stimulus &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA on Oct. 1 closed its sell-rupee trade,
            saying global risk sentiment has improved after the Fed
            decision. BNP Paribas SA recommends investors buy the rupee,
            saying the partial shutdown of the U.S. government will likely
            prolong stimulus and boost the amount of cash available in the
            global banking system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the fact that you're going to see such a disruptive
            end to the U.S. fiscal debate, the Fed may continue to feel that
            they have to do the heavy lifting in terms of supporting
            growth,' Mirza Baig, Singapore-based head of foreign-exchange
            and interest rate strategy at BNP Paribas, said in a Sept. 30
            telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like Bernanke, new RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan will also be
            under pressure to manage the economy with little help from the
            government before next year's elections, according to
            Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA), or SEB. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Rajan Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In his maiden policy review on Sept. 20, Rajan unexpectedly
            raised the benchmark repurchase rate to 7.50 percent from 7.25
            percent to curb inflation and counter outflows. He said taming
            the fastest price increases among the largest emerging markets
            is his top priority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Standard Poor's last month reiterated it may downgrade
            India's debt rating to junk as fuel and food subsidies
            threatened Prime Minister Singh goal of curbing the government's
            budget deficit. Credit-default swaps insuring the bonds of State
            Bank of India (SBIN), a proxy for the sovereign, against non-payment
            for five years have climbed 140 basis points from the year's low
            of 174 in May, according to data provider CMA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'At least until the elections are done, Rajan is pretty
            much on his own,' Sean Yokota, head of Asia strategy at SEB in
            Singapore, said in a Sept. 30 telephone interview. 'Considering
            India's huge funding needs, I wouldn't consider buying the rupee
            until we have clarity on Fed tapering.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Apollo Said Among Bidders for Lloyds Dublin Portfolio</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. investment firms Lone Star
            Funds, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)
            are among the bidders for 25 Dublin properties being sold by
            Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) as it exits Ireland, according to
            people with knowledge of the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Davy, Ireland's largest securities firm, is also involved
            in initial bids submitted before the Sept. 30 deadline, said two
            of the people. All of the people declined to be identified
            because the process is private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., the broker managing the sale, is
            seeking 140 million euros ($191 million) for a portfolio called
            Ulysses that includes the Justice Ministry's headquarters as
            well as office buildings, stores and apartments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ireland's real estate market, led by Dublin, is emerging
            from the biggest slump in western Europe. Income returns from
            office buildings in the capital are more than 10.5 percent a
            year, the highest among cities covered by research firm
            Investment Property Databank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Representatives for Goldman, Lone Star, Apollo and Jones
            Lang declined to comment on the sale. Emile Abu-Shakra, a
            spokesman for Lloyds, declined to comment in an e-mail. Davy is
            advising an overseas institutional investor on the sale,
            according to one of the people. A representative for the firm
            also declined to comment on the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the Ulysses properties previously belonged to Liam
            Carroll, one of the country's biggest developers during its
            real-estate bubble, who has seen many of his properties seized
            by banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lloyds decided three years ago to close the Irish unit it
            acquired as part of its 2008 takeover of HBOS Plc and sell or
            run off the assets. The bank has taken 12.5 billion pounds ($20
            billion) of impairment charges on Irish loans since the nation's
            real-estate market collapsed in 2008, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman-Backed Essent Adds Wells Fargo as IPO Underwriter</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), the mortgage
            insurer backed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and billionaire
            George Soros, added Wells Fargo Co., its largest customer, to
            the group of underwriters for an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, accounted for 17
            percent of Essent's sales in the first six months of this year,
            according to a regulatory filing today from the Bermuda-based
            insurer. The firm also added Bank of America Corp., the third-largest mortgage originator, as an
            underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurance, which covers losses when borrowers
            default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs, is typically
            selected by originators. Essent was founded amid the financial
            crisis, when record homeowner defaults pushed some rivals from
            the business. As home prices rise, firms that survived are
            attracting investors looking for ways to bet on housing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'New capital would help fund Essent's continued growth,'
            Helen Remeza, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said in a
            Sept. 23 research note. 'A capital raise could also further
            differentiate Essent Guaranty from its more weakly capitalized
            peers with legacy exposures.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo (WFC) is the only customer to account for more than
            10 percent of Essent's revenue, according to the filing. New
            York-based Goldman Sachs is leading the offering, with JPMorgan
            Chase Co. (JPM), the No. 2 mortgage lender, and Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Most Read on Bloomberg: Shutdown, Goldman, Stocks, Schwarzman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. First U.S. Shutdown in 17 Years Unavoidable With No Talks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government stands poised
            for its first partial shutdown in 17 years at midnight tonight,
            after a weekend with no signs of negotiations or compromise from
            the Congress or the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;2. Government Shutdown Begins as Congress Divides on Spending &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government began its first
            partial shutdown in 17 years, idling as many as 800,000 federal
            employees, closing national parks and halting some services
            after Congress failed to break a partisan deadlock by a midnight
            deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Goldman Said to Make $1.5 Million Error in Ford Bond Issue &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. mistakenly
            added about $1.5 million of interest costs to a Ford Motor Co.
            bond sale last week by using the wrong Treasury note as a
            benchmark for the security, according to two people with
            knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Global Stocks Drop, Treasuries Gain as Government Shutdown
            Looms &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Global stocks fell the most in a
            month, trimming the biggest quarterly advance since the start of
            2012, before a potential U.S. government shutdown. Treasuries
            pared early gains while crude oil slid to the lowest level in
            three months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Schwarzman Says Selling BlackRock in 1994 Was 'Heroic' Error &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Group LP's Steve
            Schwarzman said his decision 19 years ago to sell what would
            become the world's largest money manager was a 'heroic'
            mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;6. Stocks Climb as Treasuries, Commodities Fall Amid U.S.
            Shutdown &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks rebounded from yesterday's
            slide as investors speculated the economic effects from the
            shutdown of the U.S. government will be limited and counteracted
            by Federal Reserve stimulus. Treasuries fell as gold tumbled and
            the dollar recovered from early losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;7. Stocks Drop on U.S. Government Shutdown as Yen, Treasuries
            Gain &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks slid around the world and gold
            rallied as the U.S. government shutdown entered a second day and
            a report showed American employers added fewer jobs than
            forecast. The dollar fell, while the yen and Treasuries rose. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;8. Seaport Agrees to Merge With Global Hunter to Build Boutique &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Seaport Group LLC, the credit-market brokerage founded in 2001, agreed to
            merge with boutique

            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. congressional standoff that
            shut down the government for the first time in 17 years is a
            buying opportunity for stock investors, if history is any guide. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Peyton Manning's record-setting start
            to the season -- 16 touchdown passes as the Denver Broncos have
            marched to 4-0 -- has oddsmakers eyeing what may be the highest
            point spread in National Football League history. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 30 (Bloomberg) -- In the end, what have we learned
            from JPMorgan Chase Co.'s $7.1 billion 'London Whale'
            trading debacle? For those who have lost track, the derivatives
            trades resulted in losses of $6.2 billion plus an additional

            cliche, that markets hate uncertainty. It's also a given that
            the future is always uncertain. How, then, do markets ever
            manage to function -- or, for that matter, businesses, which
            must make decisions today about investments that will pay off in

        <headline>Midnight Madness Scene: Goldman Fights Morgan for Charity</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Almost 300 people in finance wandered
            the streets of Manhattan this weekend in the all-night puzzle
            competition 'Midnight Madness.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From sunset Saturday night to around 2 p.m. on Sunday, 30
            teams of 10 tapped on gravestones, assembled an electronic piano
            and decoded countless ciphers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The competition, in its second year, lets young
            professionals raise money for charity while showing off their
            skills in problem-solving. The challenges are in development for
            months and feature dozens of clues, cues, keys and experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a combination of solving puzzles and figuring out
            the quirky, twisted stuff that goes on in the minds of Game
            Control,' said Dan Sharfman, captain of Black Gold,
            representing the commodities group at Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Game Control consisted of more than 50 people assembled by
            Goldman partner Elisha Wiesel, who founded the 'Madness' and
            is the son of Elie Wiesel, as well as event producer Lindsi
            Shine, and game designers Mat Laibowitz and Dan Michaelson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Their headquarters was Big Daddy's Diner in the East 20s,
            where the hint-givers included Alan Solomon, who played the
            character that planned 'The Great Allnighter' in the 1980 film
            'Midnight Madness.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The entry fee is $50,000. Employees of Citigroup Inc. (C),
            Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS) turned to their senior managers for
            donations. Citigroup's global markets team orchestrated stunts,
            such as paying to throw a pie at your boss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Money Raised &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The result: $2.9 million raised for Good Shepherd Services,
            which cares for the poor in New York City. It was more than
            double the proceeds from last year's inaugural event. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I live close to Red Hook and knowing these guys are
            engaged there in housing and health care makes this
            meaningful,' said Shahzad Ali of the prime services group at
            Goldman and a member of team 0xff00, which won last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The competition began in the parking lot of an abandoned
            Pathmark near the Manhattan Bridge. The Alphanauts, a team of
            Connecticut hedge-funders, arrived after dining at Nobu. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hints and the clues led teams around the city from Pier
            25 in Hudson River Park to the roof of a private event space and
            New York Marble Cemetery in the East Village. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The West Coast Burninators, with some high-tech types who
            tackle puzzles like this on a regular basis, came in first.
            Teams crossed over a miniature bridge printed with the word
            'Finish,' located at 7 World Trade Center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Exhausted, many saw the open arms of Sister Paulette
            LoMonaco, the head of Good Shepherd Services, who was ready with
            hugs and bagels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The connection with 'Midnight Madness' is that every day
            we are working to solve the puzzle of extreme poverty,' Sister
            Paulette said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fibria, Suzano Rally as Goldman Sachs Says Buy: Sao Paulo Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Suzano Papel e Celulose SA (SUZB3) and Fibria
            Celulose SA (FIBR3), Brazil's best-performing paper makers this year,
            rallied as Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. recommended buying the
            stocks, citing higher pulp demand and lower supply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fibria advanced 4.3 percent to 27.29 reais at 2:37 p.m. in
            Sao Paulo trading, the biggest gain today on the MSCI
            Brazil/Materials Index, which was little changed. Suzano added
            2.4 percent to 8.79 reais, the second-biggest advance on that
            gauge. The benchmark Ibovespa index slid 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs boosted its recommendation on both stocks
            from the equivalent of hold, citing a 26 percent increase in
            Brazilian pulp sales to China in August. Fibria and Suzano will
            also gain as the decision by Chile's Empresas Copec SA and
            Finland's Stora Enso Oyj to postpone the opening of a plant in
            Uruguay to the first quarter of 2014 reduces supply, according
            to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fibria and Suzano 'are best positioned to benefit from
            improved demand,' Marcelo Aguiar, Diogo Miura and Humberto Meireles, analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
            research note to
            clients. 'Both stocks have already significantly outperformed
            the market year-to-date, but this has largely reflected
            depreciation of the Brazilian currency and higher pulp prices in
            2013.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Suzano gained 25 percent this year and Fibria advanced 20
            percent while the real weakened 6.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Currie Says Gold Is 'Slam Dunk' Sell After Shutdown</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gold, set for its first annual loss
            in 13 years, is a 'slam dunk' sell for next year because the
            U.S. economy will extend its recovery after lawmakers resolve
            stalemates over the nation's budget and debt ceiling, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s Jeffrey Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank has a target for gold prices next year at $1,050
            an ounce, Currie, Goldman Sachs's head of commodities research,
            said today on a panel in London. The precious metal has tumbled
            21 percent this year to $1,322.28 an ounce on speculation that
            the Federal Reserve would reduce its $85 billion monthly bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing,
            as the economy
            recovers. Lawmakers probably will reach an agreement on raising
            the debt ceiling before the Oct. 17 deadline, Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Once we get past this stalemate in Washington, precious
            metals are a slam dunk sell at that point,' Currie said. 'You
            have to argue that with significant recovery in the U.S.,
            tapering of QE should put downward pressure on gold prices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Currie and Ric Deverell, the head of commodities research
            at Credit Suisse AG, both said on a panel at the Commodities
            Week conference in London today that selling gold is their top
            recommendation for trading in raw materials in the next year.
            Gold is heading for its first annual loss since 2000, and is the
            third-worst performing commodity in the Standard Poor's GSCI
            gauge of 24 raw materials this year, after corn and silver. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Senate Democrats are planning a test vote before the end of
            this week on a measure that would grant President Barack Obama
            authority to raise the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling. The U.S.
            will run out of borrowing authority on Oct. 17 and will have
            about $30 billion in cash after that. The country would be
            unable to pay all of its bills, including benefits, salaries and
            interest, some time between Oct. 22 and Oct. 31, according to
            the Congressional Budget Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The downside of driving the bus off the cliff is so
            significant that we will come to a resolution,' Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ocado Rises to Record After Goldman's Buy Rating: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado Group Plc (OCDO) rose to the highest
            since its initial public offering three years ago after Goldman
            Sachs (GS) Group Inc. recommended buying the shares and said a tie-up
            with William Morrison Supermarkets Plc. will accelerate growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K.'s largest Internet-only grocer climbed 5.1 percent
            to 450.50 pence, the highest price since July 2010. Goldman
            Sachs, which previously held no rating for Ocado, said in a
            report to clients that its 24-month share-price estimate for the
            stock was 545 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado struck a 25-year deal in May to provide an online
            grocery service for Morrison, the U.K.'s fourth-largest grocer,
            beginning in January 2014. As well as operating its own online
            food-delivery service, Hatfield, England-based Ocado is trying
            to license its warehouse-processing and Web technology to
            domestic and international retailers. The company expects more
            deals like the Morrison (MRW) agreement, Chief Executive Officer Tim Steiner said in a speech in Paris
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The deal essentially gives Ocado a stake in the profit
            pool of Morrison's online business over the next 25 years,
            broadening its market opportunity in the U.K.,' Goldman Sachs
            analysts led by Franklin Walding said in the report. 'It also
            provides an element of diversification away from purely
            Ocado.com sales.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ocado was the second biggest gainer among stocks on the
            FTSE 350 Index today. The stock has advanced more than fivefold
            this year, giving the company a market value of 2.6 billion
            pounds ($4.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank estimated Ocado's sales will grow 19
            percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, up from 16
            percent in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of 11 analysts who follow Ocado and share their findings
            with Bloomberg, six recommend selling the stock, three suggest
            buying and two advise holding. The average 12-month price target
            for the stock is 258.33 pence, based on six estimates, implying
            a potential decline of 43 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Federal Grid Slides to 4-Year Low on Goldman Cut: Moscow Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Grid Co. dropped to the
            lowest level in more than four years after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. cut Russia's state-run power transmission company to sell
            from neutral, saying a tariff-freeze plan will crimp earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock sank 2.1 percent to 9.535 kopeks, the weakest
            level since February 2009 by the close in Moscow. About 3
            billion shares changed hands, 97 percent of the three-month
            daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Government plans to freeze tariff growth next year and
            match increases to consumer prices from 2015 will lead to a
            'significant earnings cut' for Moscow-based Federal Grid,
            Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed note dated yesterday. With
            economic growth at the slowest since a 2009 recession, Russia is
            seeking ways to tame inflation so the central bank can cut
            interest rates and stimulate growth. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's a bad time for the power sector, tariff growth is
            being halted while investment programs remain hefty,' Mikhail Rasstrigin, an analyst at VTB Capital, said by
            phone from
            Moscow. 'Investors are pricing in the worst possible outcome
            for these stocks and are selling shares.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OAO Russian Grids, the nation's largest electricity
            distributor, sank 4 percent to 88.4 kopeks, the lowest level
            since March 2009. The power companies were among the biggest
            decliners on the benchmark Micex (INDEXCF) stock index, which sank 0.3
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman reduced its estimates for Federal Grid's earnings
            before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 5
            percent for 2014 and 14 percent for 2015. The reduced profit
            outlook and 'stretched' balance sheet won't allow the company
            to pay 'attractive' dividends, analysts including Moscow-based
            Artyom Golodnov said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russian Grids' investment program will be cut by a range of
            200 billion rubles ($6.2 billion) to 300 billion rubles over the
            next five years due to the tariff freeze, Energy Minister

        <headline>Persimmon Gains After Goldman Predicts 70% Jump: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Persimmon Plc (PSN) rose the most in almost
            two months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the stock may
            increase by 70 percent within six months as it benefits from a
            housing recovery outside London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K.'s largest homebuilder by market value climbed 5
            percent to 1,131 pence in London trading, the biggest increase
            since Aug. 16. Goldman raised its price estimate for the stock
            by 2 percent to 1,854 pence, it said in a note today. Goldman
            based the estimate on a starting price of 1,089 pence. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Persimmon's exposure outside of London could ultimately
            see the most recovery in terms of housing transactions,'
            analysts including Eshan Toorabally wrote in the report. 'The
            circa 10 percent fall in the share price over the last three
            months offers an attractive opportunity to invest in a company
            which we expect to see significant earnings growth over the next
            three years.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Though investors are increasingly betting that the Bank of
            England may increase rates earlier than previously expected,
            such hikes haven't historically led to 'significant weakness in
            housing fundamentals' or stock price performance for home
            building-related equities, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of 17 analysts who follow Persimmon and share their ratings
            with Bloomberg, eight recommend buying the stock, three suggest
            selling and six advise holding. The average 12-month price
            target is 1,247 pence, based on 10 estimates, implying a
            potential gain of 11.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman added Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) to its 'conviction buy
            list' today. The High Wycombe, England-based homebuilder's
            share price rose 5.2 percent to 103.8 pence today. Goldman also
            upgraded Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) and Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) to
            buy from neutral. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Persimmon has climbed 51 percent this year, the fourth-best
            performance among stocks in the Bloomberg U.K. Homebuilders
            Index, which has added 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley Sees Gold Lower in 2014 as Goldman Says Sell</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gold will extend losses into 2014
            amid expectations the Federal Reserve will pare stimulus as the
            U.S. recovers, according to Morgan Stanley, adding to bearish
            calls from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We recommend staying away from gold at this point in the
            cycle,' Melbourne-based analyst Joel Crane said in a video
            report received today. Bullion will average $1,313 an ounce in
            2014, down from the $1,420 forecast for this year, Morgan
            Stanley said in its quarterly metals report on Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion is heading for the sixth weekly loss in seven and
            investment holdings are shrinking even as U.S. lawmakers wrangle
            over the debt ceiling and budget, seeking to avert a default and
            end a government shutdown. Gold is a 'slam dunk' sell for next
            year because the U.S. will extend the recovery after lawmakers
            resolve the stalemate, Jeffrey Currie, Goldman's head of
            commodities research, said this week. The political deadlock in
            Washington is a 'farce,' according to Marex Spectron Group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our forecast profile heading into next year is relatively
            flat against our expectations of rising real interest rates and
            the U.S. dollar,' Crane said in the video. Bullion will average
            lower every year through 2018, Morgan Stanley forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion, which has averaged $1,453 in 2013, is heading for
            the first annual loss in 13 years after dropping 22 percent. The
            price tumbled to a 34-month low of $1,180.50 in London in June
            on expectations that the Fed would taper the $85-billion-a-month
            of bond buying. Gold fell 0.6 percent to $1,298.19 at 6:01 p.m.
            in London, dropping for a third day. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fed Minutes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is bearish. While gold may look weak
            fundamentally, 'in this sort of environment, you can make a
            strong argument that gold isn't too bad a thing to hold,' said
            Kevin Norrish, head of commodities research at Barclays Plc. 'I
            don't think it's a slam dunk short by any means,' he said
            yesterday. Short bets are wagers on declines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most Fed policy makers said that the central bank was
            likely to taper its bond purchases this year, even as they
            unexpectedly refrained from such a move in September, according
            to minutes of their last meeting released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ric Deverell, Currie's counterpart at Credit Suisse, said
            on Oct. 8 that selling gold is his top recommendation for
            trading in raw materials in the next year. Deverell said in May
            that bullion was going to get 'crushed.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETP Holdings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors sold 711.8 metric tons from bullion-backed
            exchange-traded products this year, erasing more than $61
            billion from the value of the funds. Holdings fell to 1,920.2
            tons on Oct. 8, the least since May 2010, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Assets are down 27 percent in 2013 after
            climbing every year since the first product was listed in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;House Republican and Senate Democratic leaders are open to
            a short-term increase in the debt limit, according to
            congressional aides of both parties, who spoke on condition of
            anonymity. President Barack Obama has already said he could
            accept a short-term deal without policy conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Tapering has been postponed not canceled, and is expected
            by year end,' Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in the Oct. 7
            report. 'We also expect the political stalemate in Washington
            to be broken before the debt ceiling is breached. Consequently,
            we see little immediate upside to the gold price either in the
            immediate future or next year.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Call Bolsters Home Inns: China Overnight</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese equities rallied the most in
            a month in New York after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
            buying Home Inns Hotels Management Inc. (HMIN) and as data showed
            Qihoo 360 Technology Co.'s search market share grew. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
            Chinese stocks in the U.S. climbed 2 percent to 103.79
            yesterday, the biggest gain since Sept. 3. Home Inns, China's
            largest budget hotel chain operator, climbed to the highest this
            week after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its top pick list,
            while China Lodging Group Ltd. (HTHT) increased the most in six days.
            Software developer Qihoo rallied the most in three weeks and
            21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) jumped to the highest level since 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said yesterday the nation's
            economic growth probably exceeded 7.5 percent in the first nine
            months of the year, a sign the government will next week report
            success in halting a two-quarter slowdown. Tourism revenue
            during the week-long Chinese holiday increased 21 percent from a
            year earlier to 223.3 billion yuan ($36.4 billion), according to
            data from the China National Tourism Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Middle-class and small-business travelers drive up
            occupancy quickly at budget hotels when the economy recovers,'
            Michael Ding, lead manager of the China Region Fund (USCOX) at U.S.
            Global Investors, which oversees $2.2 billion, said by phone
            from San Antonio, Texas yesterday. 'Also, we've seen a boom in
            travel and tourism in China during the Oct. 1-7 public
            holiday.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The iShares China ETF (FXI), the largest Chinese exchange-traded
            fund in the U.S., climbed 1.1 percent to a two-week high of
            $38.14 in New York. The Standard Poor's 500 Index jumped 2.2
            percent in a second day of rally as lawmakers moved toward an
            agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid default. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Budget Hotels &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China Lodging's American depositary receipts advanced 2.5
            percent to $19.50, after surging as much as 6.7 percent earlier.
            Shanghai-based Home Inns climbed 1.5 percent to $37.03, jumping
            as much as 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Budget hotels tend to respond more quickly to an economic
            recovery in China, according to the Goldman Sachs note
            yesterday. 'We believe a recovering macro to be incrementally
            positive to economy hotels' RevPAR,' or revenue per available
            room, the note said, adding Home Inns to the bank's 'conviction
            buy' list and upgrading China Lodging to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales in China's retail and catering sectors increased 13.6
            percent during the seven-day holiday from a year earlier to 870
            billion yuan, the nation's commerce ministry said on its website
            Oct. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qihoo's ADRs gained 4.3 percent to $82.27, the most since
            Sept. 19. The company, owner of China's second-largest search
            engine, has surged 177 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Baidu (BIDU), the biggest web search engine, advanced 4.5 percent
            to $153.16, rallying the most in four weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qihoo's share in the online search market rose to 21
            percent by the end of September, while Baidu's fluctuated
            between 61 percent to 64.5 percent last month before sliding to
            60 percent in early October, 86Research analysts said in a note
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ), a provider of mobile-security services,
            rallied 4.1 percent to $19.68, snapping a three-day slump. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NQ's 'Music Radar' mobile app, started in September, saw
            downloads jump to 15 million and daily audio search inquiries
            triple to 3 million, Beijing-based NQ said in a statement
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;21Vianet, China's biggest independent Internet data-center
            operator, surged 8.9 percent to $18.04, the highest close since
            April 2011. Trading volume was 2.4 times the 90-day average,
            data compiled by Bloomberg showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beijing-based 21Vianet yesterday appointed Wing-Dar Ker,
            who formerly worked at Microsoft Corp. as the general manager of
            customer service for the Greater China region, as the company's
            president of Microsoft cloud operation. 21Vianet started a
            partnership in May with Microsoft to offer cloud services in
            China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) slid 0.4 percent to
            10,460.18, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.9
            percent to 2,190.93, paring gains this week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Buys Ringgit, Peso on Prospects for Rate Increases</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management LP
            boosted holdings of Malaysia's ringgit and the Philippine peso
            in recent weeks, betting the prospect of interest-rate increases
            will spur appreciation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ringgit will strengthen 5 percent against the dollar by
            year-end and a 7.3 percent gain is likely for the peso, based on
            estimates given by Philip Moffitt, head of Asia-Pacific fixed
            income at Goldman Sachs Asset, which oversees $860 billion.
            Benchmark rates in Malaysia and the Philippines will increase at
            least 25 basis points by the end of 2014, according to the
            majority of economists in Bloomberg surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We expect interest rates to rise over the next year in
            Malaysia and the Philippines, and that's less likely in some
            other Southeast Asian economies such as Thailand,' Sydney-based
            Moffitt said in an Oct. 8 phone interview. 'We'll see a bounce
            in the two currencies.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ringgit has led a rebound in Southeast Asian currencies
            since Aug. 31 as the Federal Reserve unexpectedly held off from
            reducing stimulus that fueled demand for emerging-market assets.
            The region's currencies all sank in the prior four months, led
            by an 11 percent slide in Indonesia's rupiah, as the U.S.
            central bank signaled plans to rein in its $85 billion-a-month
            bond-buying program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tapering of the program is unlikely to start before
            December, and Southeast Asian assets are being boosted by
            Japanese demand for overseas investments, said Moffitt, who
            oversees Goldman Sachs Asset's unconstrained emerging-market
            local-debt funds. 'Liquidity generation' in the U.S., euro
            region and Japan is the highest in two years, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ringgit Outperforms &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ringgit climbed 2.1 percent this month to 3.1925 per
            dollar, the best performance among Asia's 11 most-traded
            currencies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Barclays
            Plc raised its three-month forecast for the ringgit by 4.5
            percent to 3.15 in September on expectations global funds will
            boost holdings of the nation's bonds, Hamish Pepper, its
            currency strategist in Singapore, said in a Sept. 27 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank Negara Malaysia held interest rates at 3 percent at a
            Sept. 5 policy meeting and warned of increased uncertainties
            surrounding the domestic growth and inflation outlook. Increases
            in consumer prices are likely to quicken as the government cuts
            subsidies, it said in a statement after the meeting. The last
            move in borrowing costs was a 25-basis-point rise in May 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Subsidy Cuts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Najib Razak reduced subsidies on gasoline
            and diesel on Sept. 3 to rein in the government's budget
            shortfall. Policy makers may announce increases in flour and
            sugar prices this month, according to an Oct. 6 report in the
            New Straits Times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. sees a chance of a 25-basis-point increase in Malaysian interest
            rates in the fourth
            quarter of 2014 'if the pare-back in subsidies is substantial
            enough to impinge on the consumer price index,' Leong Sook Mei,
            the bank's Southeast Asian head of global markets research in
            Singapore, said in an interview yesterday. Consumer-price gains
            eased to 1.9 percent in August from a 16 month-high of 2 percent
            in July, data showed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ringgit has room to strengthen due to improving growth
            expectations in China in the near term and because of Bank
            Negara's shift to 'a slight hawkish bias,' Citigroup Inc.
            strategists including Siddharth Mathur in Singapore wrote in an
            Oct. 3 report. China's economy, which is second only to the U.S.
            in size, has strong momentum, and imports will reach $10
            trillion in the next five years, the official Xinhua News Agency
            reported this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Philippine Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The peso has gained 0.9 percent this month to 43.155 per
            dollar and Moffitt predicts a year-end exchange rate of 40. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The currency has climbed as President Benigno Aquino
            increases spending to a record in 2013 while seeking more than
            $17 billion of investments in highways and airports to improve
            infrastructure. Gross domestic product increased 7.5 percent in
            the second quarter from a year earlier, matching China's pace.
            The nation is poised to be among the world's five fastest-growing economies in 2013 and 2014, Bloomberg
            surveys show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will probably keep interest
            rates steady this year and next, 'barring any unforeseen
            shocks,' Governor Amando Tetangco said in an Oct. 2 interview.
            The central bank held its benchmark rate at a record-low 3.5
            percent for a seventh meeting on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inflation Goal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inflation eased to a four-year low in August, with consumer
            prices rising 2.1 percent from a year earlier. The central bank
            aims to have consumer-price gains averaging 3 percent to 5
            percent in 2013 and 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Philippine economy is in a better shape than most of
            its Asian counterparts, which should provide support for the
            peso, Mitul Kotecha, Hong Kong-based head of foreign exchange
            strategy at Credit Agricole SA (ACA), said in an Oct. 7 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Philippine GDP is forecast to increase 7 percent this year,
            the most since 2010, according to the median estimate of
            economists in a Bloomberg survey. That compares with projected
            growth rates of 4 percent for Thailand, 4.5 percent for Malaysia
            and 5.8 percent for Indonesia, separate Bloomberg surveys show. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>FLSmidth Falls as Goldman Sees Delays in Fixes: Copenhagen Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;FLSmidth Co. A/S (FLS) fell in
            Copenhagen trading after Goldman Sachs Global Investment
            Research said profit at the Danish mining equipment maker will
            stall through 2015 as a restructuring process drags on. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FLSmidth fell as much as 2.5 percent to 280.70 kroner,
            making it the biggest loser in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20
            Index. The stock declined 1.8 percent to 282.70 kroner at 9:46
            a.m. in the Danish capital, with volume at 27 percent of the
            three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FLSmidth, which has missed analyst profit estimates in its
            last six quarterly reports, presented on Aug. 23 a restructuring
            plan which it said will boost profits by eliminating 1,100 jobs
            and cutting other costs. Goldman said in a note distributed
            today that the plan won't lift the company fast enough out of
            its 'trough year in margins,' and lowered its recommendation
            on the stock to neutral from sell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Given the poor demand outlook for mining, we now believe
            that restructuring will still be required post 2013 and
            therefore do not expect as fast margin recovery as we did
            before,' Goldman said in the note. The Copenhagen-based company
            faces 'too strong a headwind' in its markets, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its price estimate on the share to 310 kroner
            from 325 kroner. The average price target of 14 analysts
            covering the stock is 346 kroner, according to estimates
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Key downside risks include failure to execute on the
            materials handling restructuring, lower metal prices, slowing
            global growth, project execution issues,' Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FLSmidth's restructuring plans targets an increase in
            earnings before interest, tax and amortization of 750 million
            kroner ($135 million) in 2015. The company, which has missed
            analyst net income estimates in its last six quarterly reports,
            is scheduled to publish third-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman, Richard Meier Boost $149 Million Newark Project</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Newark, New Jersey, is home to one
            of the poorest downtowns in the U.S., a once-exuberant
            commercial retail corridor where many'old movie palaces, ornate
            department stores and grimy storefronts stand empty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Property is cheap because real-estate profits seem elusive.
            Developers aren't flocking here. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, a convention-defying $149 million project called
            Teachers Village is in progress, aided by a long view and deep
            pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ron Beit, chief executive officer of Newark-based developer
            RBH Group LLC, is leading a group of well-known investors behind
            three charter schools and residential buildings with
            $800'apartments. Pritzker Prize-winning'Richard Meier is the
            architect. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a U.S. Senate candidate, and
            Governor Chris Christie, a possible presidential contender,
            thought the project important enough to participate in its Sept.
            25 ribbon cutting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hope is that good schools, inexpensive housing and
            well-chosen retail tenants would bring activity to the
            neighborhood, eventually a full-blown revival and further down
            the road the prospect of profits from additional 15 million
            square feet of mixed-use space. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Great Access &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They understood the value proposition,' Beit said, 'and
            that land is too cheap in Newark considering its assets and
            access to the Northeast Corridor'' -- the Boston, New York,
            Washington rail line. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investors include Nicolas Berggruen of Berggruen
            Holdings Inc., Warren Lichtenstein of Steel Partners LLC,
            Frederick Iseman of CI Capital Partners LLC and Jeffrey Gould's
            BRT Realty Trust. (BRT) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The blue-chip lineup attracted Goldman Sachs, which made a
            $27 million senior loan. Local, state and federal government
            sources added several varieties of tax credits and subsidized
            bonds to the developers' $14 million in equity. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meier supplied the project's master plan, doing without the
            sculptural gymnastics he's known for -- at the Getty Museum in
            Los Angeles and elsewhere -- to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm designed a clean-lined four-story box, one of the
            first two buildings that have opened for the present school
            term. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rough and smooth brick patterns echo a mix of clear and
            translucent glass to make a surface composition as rich as a
            Mondrian painting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nice Windows &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two charter schools perch above street-level stores.
            Impeccably proportioned windows pour daylight into the
            classrooms of the 500-student Spark Charter Academy through
            alternating clear and translucent panels. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike most inner city schools, there are no bars on these
            windows. The cheerful interiors were designed by KSS Architects
            of Princeton, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 75 students of the Discovery Charter School, which
            covers grades four through eight, share a large open space
            painted lavender and dotted with houseplants. A girl named Kayla
            described an 'amazing' curriculum that focuses on the basics
            while leaving time for botany and cooking skills. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KSS also designed a six-story red-brick building across the
            street for the middle school students of the Great Oak Charter
            School, which depends heavily on college graduates to tutor
            students. There's also a yet-to-open daycare center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The KSS design lacks Meier's unerring sense of proportion
            and attention to detail and is worrisomely bare-bones inside. A
            windowless fire stair is the chief way students move from floor
            to floor. A caged exercise rooftop is a grim place to blow off
            steam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Oddly, none of the schools has a ground-level playground in
            spite of an abundance of nearby parking lots. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Playgrounds Please &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perhaps this can change by the time some 1,000 children
            attend the schools and daycare center. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New shops Beit is building will appeal to parents, and
            eventually to residents, when 200 rental apartments aimed at
            teachers are completed. Steel is rising on the first two of
            those buildings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beit avoided the national chains that lazy lenders prefer.
            He signed leases likely to make Teachers Village a destination,
            such as Harlem cupcake store Tonnie's Minis and Chicken Jones, a
            casual restaurant created by Manhattan restaurateur Michael Vann. Those magnetic tenancies should fill
            surrounding
            storefronts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I asked Beit how he financed quality architecture and
            unique rentals in a city developers shun. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He praised early partners who bought land -- not just for
            Teachers Village, but to eventually accommodate 8,000 residences
            and millions of commercial square feet that are in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Beit'and his investors will really cash in if Teachers
            Village proves to be a'catalyst for a broader Newark revival and
            the land they've banked rises in'value. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Creating financial components that made investors
            stretch, but were not totally out of the realm of what they were
            used to, added layers of complexity,' Beit said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Entrenched Poverty &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He does not see financing such a catalytic mix getting any
            easier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's too bad. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Struggling communities can almost never tap Wall Street
            stars and celebrated architects. Yet these are the places most
            in need of such transformational investment, not the
            opportunistic junk they usually get stuck with (think casinos)
            that fails to ease entrenched poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;(James S. Russell writes on architecture for Muse, the arts
            and culture section of Bloomberg News. He is the author of 'The
            Agile City.' The opinions expressed are his own.) &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>WDH Falls as Goldman Sees End to Share Rally: Copenhagen Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;William Demant Holding A/S (WDH), the
            Nordic region's biggest hearing-aid maker, fell the most among
            Copenhagen's benchmark stocks today after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. said a rally in the share is coming to an end. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WDH dropped as much as 2.1 percent, making it today's
            biggest loser in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20 index. (KFX) The stock
            lost 1.1 percent to 525 kroner at 10:11 a.m. in the Danish
            capital, with trading volume at 30 percent of the three-month
            daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WDH shares had jumped 14 percent in the six months through
            yesterday, compared with a 6.5 percent gain in the C20 index, on
            bets that the company will win market share and increase
            profitability amid the introduction of new hearing aids. In a
            note distributed today, Goldman lowered its recommendation on
            the stock to neutral from buy and said recent share gains leave
            little room for further advances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we view WDH as well-positioned within European
            Medtech, our 12-month price target implies limited upside
            potential from current levels,' Goldman analysts, including
            Veronika Dubajova, said in the note. 'In addition, the company
            has not achieved any significant market share gains following
            the Alta launch at the beginning of 2013; this is contrary to
            our expectation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman has a price estimate of 550 kroner on WDH shares,
            which compares with an average target of 489 kroner among 22
            analysts tracking the stock, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smoerum, Denmark-based WDH, which is scheduled to publish a
            third-quarter trading update on Nov. 5, has missed analysts'
            average net income estimates in seven of its last eight half-year earnings reports. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) declined
            2.4 percent in New York trading after revenue dropped the most
            among the biggest Wall Street banks and fixed-income results
            were the worst since the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Third-quarter revenue of $6.72 billion was 20 percent lower
            than a year earlier and fell short of the $7.35 billion average
            estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bond trading
            plunged 47 percent to $1.29 billion, the New York-based company
            said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
            expenses 25 percent in the quarter to offset falling revenue,
            including a 35 percent reduction in compensation. The firm was
            the only major bank to post a decline in equities trading, and
            revenue compared with the second quarter dropped in three of the
            company's four business units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income revenue 'looks very weak, and surprisingly,
            it looks clearly weaker than its peers,' said Richard Staite, a
            bank analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. 'It's more than just
            weak client trading, it looks like. They could've been badly
            positioned in the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to $158.32 at 4:15 p.m. in New York.
            The stock had gained 27 percent this year through yesterday
            after advancing 41 percent in 2012. The shares have traded below
            1.5 times book value for the past 3 1/2 years, the longest such
            streak in the company's history. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the bank that gets most of its revenue from trading, set aside a
            smaller portion for staff pay in the first nine months of the year than in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compensation,
            which includes salaries, benefits, bonuses and the expense of deferred pay awarded in prior years, fell 5
            percent to $10.4 billion in the first three quarters from a year earlier, the New York-based company said
            today in a statement. Revenue in the same period increased 2 percent to $25.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, allocated 41 percent of revenue, down from 44 percent in the first
            nine months of 2012, as he seeks to boost returns. Last year, the firm cut expenses in the fourth quarter,
            bringing the total pay pool to 38 percent of revenue, the second-lowest figure since Goldman Sachs has been
            a public company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compensation expense is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs's
            32,600 employees $319,755 for the nine months. The firm set aside $11 billion in the same period of 2012,
            equal to an average $336,442 for each of the 32,600 people employed by Goldman Sachs at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Compensation for corporate and investment bankers at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the largest U.S.
            lender, fell 4.4 percent in the first nine months from a year earlier. The $8.69 billion represented 31
            percent of revenue at the unit, which was created last year when the company combined its investment bank
            with the corporate bank and treasury and securities-services units. &lt;/p&gt;

            a cyclical climb in trading and investment-banking revenue that hasn't arrived. The stock has traded below
            1.5 times book value for the past 3 1/2 years, the longest such streak in the company's history. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman typically outperforms, and cost controls help for the time being,' Keith Davis, an analyst
            at Farr, Miller Washington LLC, which manages more than $900 million, said before the results were
            announced. 'We're still optimistic, though the third quarter wasn't a home run by any means.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined 3 percent to $157.47 at 7:50 a.m. in New York. The stock had gained 27
            percent this year through yesterday after advancing 41 percent in 2012. The shares are still below their
            pre-crisis peak of $247.92 on Oct. 31, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Sachs Partner Jane Chwick Named to MarketAxess Board</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (MKTX), the owner
            of an electronic bond and derivatives-trading system, appointed
            ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Jane Chwick to its board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chwick, who was co-chief operating officer of technology at
            Goldman Sachs, is now an advisory director at the firm, New
            York-based MarketAxess said today in a statement. Chwick was
            listed as a full partner at Goldman Sachs in an October 2012
            filing. Advisory directors typically are former partners who are
            no longer employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Electronic bond trading is gaining momentum as new
            regulations curbing risk prompt banks to trim inventories of
            corporate debt, reducing their willingness to act as middlemen
            between buyers and sellers. Firms including Deutsche Bank AG and
            Goldman Sachs are designing systems to accommodate the shift.
            MarketAxess and BlackRock Inc. (BLK) said in April they were creating
            an alliance for a unified bond-trading platform. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'MarketAxess has been at the forefront of market-structure
            changes in fixed income for well over a decade and today we are
            at a critical juncture in the evolution of these markets,'
            Chwick said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment-grade bond volume on the company's electronic
            system are on pace to exceed $400 billion in 2013 after surging
            45 percent to $44 billion in September from a year earlier, data
            from the company show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chwick joined Goldman Sachs in 1983 as a programmer and
            held senior positions including global head of technology for
            fixed income, currencies and commodities, and global head of
            technology for the securities division, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News,
            competes with MarketAxess to provide electronic-trading systems
            for fixed-income markets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bass-Backed NMI IPO Seen Riskier Than Goldman-Soros Rival</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;NMI Holdings Inc. (NMIH), the mortgage guarantor backed by Kyle Bass, Carlyle Group LP (CG) and
            BlueMountain Capital Management LLC, is seeking to be the first U.S. insurer since 2009 to file an initial
            public offering without posting a profit, as demand climbs for housing-related investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            firm had sold coverage on 22 individual loans at the end of September, is working to get its computer system
            running and will be unprofitable at least through next year, according to the IPO filing. NMI also competes
            with Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), a profitable company whose investors include George Soros and Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc., that's pitching its own IPO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investor appetite for home-loan guarantors is
            climbing as the U.S. property market rebounds at the fastest pace in seven years and the government retreats
            from backing mortgages. Still, NMI's IPO filing carries warnings more often found in Internet and
            biotechnology offerings, said Josef Schuster, founder of a firm that tracks public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In financials, it's a rare occasion that you see such unseasoned deals,' Schuster said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the Oct. 8 document, Emeryville, California-based NMI described itself as a development stage
            corporation started in 2011. 'We have a history of losses and expect to continue to report annual net losses
            in the near term,' the company said. 'Our ability to achieve profitability, if at all, is uncertain.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts Arabica Coffee Forecasts by 7.7% on Weather</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
            price forecasts for arabica coffee traded in New York by 7.7
            percent, citing favorable weather and the biggest stockpiles of
            the variety favored by Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The beans traded on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange will be
            at $1.20 a pound in three, six and 12 months, the bank said in a
            report e-mailed today. That's down from last month's forecast
            for $1.30 a pound. Arabica coffee futures fell 20 percent this
            year on signs of bigger harvests in leading producer Brazil and
            Colombia, the second-biggest grower of the variety. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Arabica coffee prices continued to decline last month on
            larger than expected Colombian production and favorable weather
            for the upcoming crop in Brazil,' Damien Courvalin, an analyst
            at the bank in New York, wrote in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures are heading for a third year of declines, the
            longest losing streak since 1993. The commodity is the fourth
            worst performer this year in the Standard Poor's GSCI gauge of
            24 raw materials, with only gold, silver and corn down by more.
            Stockpiles at the end of this season will be 30.5 million bags,
            the highest since 2008-09, estimates the U.S. Department of
            Agriculture. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Coffee prices could rebound if there are further cuts to
            production in Central America, where leaf rust disease has hit
            crops, or if funds decide to close out bets on lower prices,
            Goldman said. Large and small speculators excluding index funds
            have been betting on lower prices since 2011, data from the U.S.
            Futures Trading Commission compiled by Bloomberg showed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arabica coffee for December deliver was little changed at
            $1.1475 a pound on ICE by 5:53 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sugar Surplus &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the global sugar surplus will be smaller this season
            than previously expected because of import demand from China and
            Indonesia, stockpiles will rise for a fourth consecutive season,
            Goldman said. Prices rallied 11 percent last month as rainfall
            reduced output in Brazil's center south, the main growing region
            of the world's leading producer, and funds started buying. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We view the recent rally as likely excessive given
            current fundamentals, exacerbated by the covering of large net
            short ICE speculative positions,' Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sugar prices will be at 17.50 cents a pound in three months
            and 19 cents a pound in six and 12 months, the bank forecasts.
            The sweetener, which fell to as low as 15.93 cents a pound in
            July, was trading today at 18.96 cents a pound for March
            delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cocoa Inventories &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global cocoa inventories will decline for a second year as
            processing rises. Bean grinding in Europe gained 4.7 percent in
            the third quarter, according to the European Cocoa Association.
            In Asia, grindings rose 12 percent and in North America advanced
            8.2 percent in the same period, according to the Cocoa
            Association of Asia and the National Confectioners Association. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures will be at $2,500 a ton in three, six and 12
            months, the bank said. The forecast is below current prices
            because of record bullish speculators bets at a time of 'high'
            stocks-to-use ratio, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cocoa for December delivery was down 1 percent to $2,740 a
            ton in New York. The beans used to make chocolate gained 22
            percent this year, this year's best performing commodity on the
            GSCI, ahead of cotton and natural gas. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Vice Chairman to Step Down at End of Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said J. Michael Evans, a vice chairman who ran emerging markets and
            was
            seen as a potential successor to Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, is retiring after more than 20
            years at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, 56, will step down at the end of the year and become
            a senior director, the New York-based company said today in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans ran businesses including the securities division,
            equity trading and equity-capital markets in a career that
            featured positions in New York, London and Hong Kong. In 2011,
            he was named to lead the emerging-markets units as part of
            Blankfein's push to be 'Goldman Sachs in more places.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Michael's deep commitment to the firm, his unrelenting
            focus on our clients and his broad global market knowledge have
            left an extraordinary mark at Goldman Sachs,' Blankfein, 59,
            said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, one of four vice chairmen among the bank's executive
            officers, led with E. Gerald Corrigan the business-standards
            committee, a group set up in 2010 to review policies and
            practices after Goldman Sachs was sued by the Securities and
            Exchange Commission for misleading investors on a 2007 sale of a
            mortgage-linked investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After that appointment, Evans was seen as a potential
            successor to Blankfein along with President Gary Cohn, the
            Financial Times wrote in 2010. Goldman Sachs paid Cohn 12
            percent more than Evans's $17 million for 2012, the first time
            since the financial crisis that Blankfein's deputies were given
            differing compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Blankfein's Plan &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein told Bloomberg Television earlier this year that
            he had no plans to leave after seven years in the top job. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The combination of this being who I am and what I do and
            having absolutely no other interests makes me think this is what
            I'll be doing for a while,' Blankfein said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans, a Canadian, graduated from Princeton University in
            1981. He won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1984, the same
            year he earned a master's degree from Oxford University. Evans
            was named a partner in 1994, a year after he joined Goldman
            Sachs from Salomon Brothers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans owns about $230 million of Goldman Sachs stock,
            according to an April filing, which counts vested options, stock
            awards and family trusts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2001, he became co-head of the equities business and
            rose to co-head of the firm's securities division, which
            includes all trading. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Conflicts, Transparency &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Evans was named chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific in
            2004, moving to Hong Kong, where he helped develop the bank's
            business in China and its relationship with Industrial
            Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398) The firm sold its remaining stake
            in ICBC this year after posting more than $3.4 billion of gains
            from the investment. Evans was named a vice chairman in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business-standards committee produced a report in
            January 2011 that laid out 39 recommendations to improve
            practices in areas such as conflicts of interest and
            transparency. In May of this year, the firm released a report
            about the actions it took in implementing the recommendations
            and the impact they had. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We spent more than 100,000 hours training our people not
            only on the things that had changed, but teaching them how these
            changes were going to be implemented and driven down through the
            organization,' Evans said in an interview in May. The efforts
            were aimed at 'making sure they stick and that they're embraced
            by the totality of our population.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>KKR to Goldman Skirmish for Scraps as LBO Bankruptcy Looms</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;KKR Co., Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and TPG Capital, the firms that led the $48 billion buyout
            of Energy Future Holdings Corp. in 2007, are fighting to receive barely 3 percent of their initial
            investment when the power generator files for bankruptcy as soon as this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negotiations
            with senior creditors including Leon Black's Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) and Centerbridge Capital
            Partners LLC, which are poised to seize control of the former TXU Corp., are at a crucial juncture today
            when agreements that allow them to view nonpublic information to foster talks expire. A proposal disclosed
            last week that wasn't accepted would have given the company's owners as little as $270 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;KKR, Goldman and TPG took Dallas-based Energy Future private in the largest leveraged buyout in
            history, an investment that was predicated on rising gas prices. Instead, they fell as the development of
            hydraulic fracturing created a surge in U.S. gas supplies, triggering 10 straight quarterly losses at the
            company since 2011 and leading Warren Buffett to say his $2 billion investment in Energy Future bonds was 'a
            big mistake.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We see bigger potential for value leakage if this bankruptcy
            restructuring turns highly contentious, highly litigious and disorganized,' Jim Hempstead, an analyst at
            bond-rating company Moody's Investors Service in New York, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dubai Property-Bubble Concerns Overdone, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Concerns that Dubai's property
            market is a bubble are exaggerated as new regulations focused on
            curbing speculation and an increasing supply helps keep values
            down, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Property prices are 36 percent below their 2008 peak even
            after rising by about a third from a low in the second quarter
            of 2011, analysts including Eyad Faraj, Matija Gergolet and
            Harsh Mehta wrote in a report published today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai home values climbed at the fastest pace in the world
            in the second quarter, a survey by broker Knight Frank LLP
            showed, stoking concern that the market may be overheating. The
            increases will slow down over the next 12 months after the
            return of speculators sparked 'unsustainable' gains, Jones
            Lang LaSalle Inc. said in an Oct. 3 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The surge prompted the sheikhdom's Land Department to
            double property registration fees to 4 percent starting Oct. 6.
            The real estate regulator is requiring developers to set aside a
            portion of a project's costs to limit the effect of advance
            sales in financing construction. Restrictions on mortgage
            lending, expected from the United Arab Emirates central bank
            this year, will also help cool the market, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Political Stability &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dubai's relative political stability and high rental yields
            of 5 percent to 6 percent will maintain its attractiveness to
            investors, according to Goldman. That compares with global
            yields of 2 percent to 3 percent, the analysts wrote. Last year,
            approximately 34 percent of Dubai's property investors were from
            South Asia, followed by 15 percent from Arab countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In neighboring Abu Dhabi, residential prices have
            stabilized and rents are increasing in the best areas, helped by
            the relocation of around 10,000 state employees from Dubai in
            the past eight months, the analysts estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi's government in Sept. 2012 required all its
            employees and those of state-related companies to live in the
            capital to receive housing allowances. The law sparked the
            relocation of workers who for years had commuted from Dubai
            where they enjoyed lower rents and better infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR) had its rating raised two levels to
            BB at Standard Poor's with a stable outlook, the ratings
            company said in a statement today. The rating is two levels
            below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aldar, Abu Dhabi's largest developer, is taking a more
            cautious approach to new projects, aims to increase sources of
            recurring income and is reducing its debt, SP said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Ordered to Advance Ex-Programmer Fees in NY Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) must
            advance computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov the legal fees he
            needs to fight New York state charges that he stole confidential
            source code from the company, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs at this time doesn't have to pay the fees
            Aleynikov incurred defending federal charges that led to his
            conviction and imprisonment before the verdict was overturned,
            said U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in Newark, New Jersey. He
            said the two sides must engage in a pretrial exchange of
            evidence on that question. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Immediate advancement of fees is required, subject only
            to an unsecured undertaking to repay them if the applicant is
            unsuccessful in the underlying litigation,' McNulty said in an
            opinion made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was convicted in federal court in Manhattan in
            2010 of stealing hundreds of thousands of lines of code and
            sentenced to 97 months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was ordered freed in February 2012 when the U.S. Court
            of Appeals in New York reversed his conviction. In August of
            that year, he was arraigned in Manhattan on state charges of
            unlawful use of scientific material and duplication of computer-related material. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vice President &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which employed Aleynikov from May 2007
            through June 2009, argued that it didn't have to pay Aleynikov's
            fees in his state prosecution because he wasn't an officer of
            the company, even though he was a vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McNulty disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It may be the case that Goldman (or the industry of which
            it is a part) has been profligate in conferring the title of
            vice president,' the judge wrote. 'If so, Goldman must bear
            the consequences of that profligacy. Goldman might easily have
            chosen to be more sparing with job titles, or to confer them in
            some other way.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's attorney Kevin Marino said he will proceed with
            evidence exchanges on the question of whether Goldman Sachs must
            indemnify his client for the federal case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs used its considerable power and influence
            to procure Mr. Aleynikov's prosecution for crimes he did not
            commit,' Marino said in an interview. 'It is only fitting that
            Goldman should now be forced to bear the cost of his restoring
            his reputation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 12-cv-05994, U.S. District Court, District of
            New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Seek Up to $402 Million in LEG Share Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc., which took
            LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) public in February, may raise as much as 294
            million euros ($402 million) by selling 7 million shares of the
            German landlord, a person with knowledge of the transaction said
            yesterday. LEG fell as much as 5.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman offered the shares at 41 euros to 42 euros each,
            said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            information isn't public. The shares were owned by Whitehall
            Street Real Estate, a Goldman Sachs money manager, and Perry
            Capital. Goldman is also managing the share sale, the person
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, Germany's second-largest property company by market
            value, was sold in the biggest initial public offering of a
            German real estate company. Goldman raised 1.3 billion euros in
            that deal, which left Whitehall with 41 percent of the shares
            and Perry with a 9 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG fell 4.1 percent to 41.80 euros at 9:20 a.m. in
            Frankfurt trading. The shares have dropped about 5.6 percent
            since the IPO, while the EPRA/FTSE Nareit Index of German
            property stocks has slid 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the IPO, 30.5 million shares were sold at 44 euros
            each. Before the offering, Whitehall held 95 percent of the
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, based in Dusseldorf, owns about 91,000 apartments in
            North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs to Open Broker-Dealer in Mexico Next Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will open a
            local broker-dealer in Mexico early next year as part of its
            expansion in Latin America, said Stephen Scherr, the firm's
            chief for the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move will allow Goldman Sachs to trade in peso-denominated securities, Scherr said today in a
            broadcast on the
            firm's website. The New York-based investment bank won
            authorization for a Mexican brokerage unit last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a very bullish view on Mexico,' said Scherr, 49,
            who is also global head of the company's financing group. 'We
            have a very strong presence in Mexico City, and in fact, by the
            early part of next year, we'll have a local broker-dealer in the
            country.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets,
            opened a local office in Santiago, Chile, earlier this year.
            Foreign companies with Mexican brokerages include Morgan Stanley (MS)
            and Credit Suisse Group AG, according to the Mexican Association
            of Brokerages. Citigroup Inc. (C)'s Banamex unit also owns a major
            brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reforms planned by Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto,
            who was elected last year, and efforts to develop the country's
            capital markets will probably attract investors, Scherr said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Anytime a market can become larger, deeper, more liquid,
            like what the Mexicans are doing, it is inevitably to the
            benefit of the economy, because I think the market will
            demonstrate greater price rationality, and will attract more and
            more investors to that market,' he said. 'It is why we're
            going there in bigger size.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which took
            LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) public in February, raised 289 million euros
            ($395 million) by selling 7 million shares of the German

            &lt;p&gt;The shares, owned by Goldman's Whitehall Street Real Estate
            and co-investor Perry Capital, were priced at 41.25 euros each,
            Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. The stake represents
            about 13 percent of LEG's share capital, according to the
            statement. Goldman managed the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, Germany's second-largest property company by market

        <headline>Blackstone, GIC Buy Stake in Goldman's European Insurer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP and GIC Pte,
            Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, agreed to buy a majority
            stake in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s European insurance business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world's biggest private-equity firm, and
            GIC will each buy 28.5 percent of the shares in Rothesay Life
            Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner Addy Loudiadis, Goldman Sachs said in a statement
            today.
            Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. will also buy 7 percent,
            and Goldman will retain 36 percent. The price wasn't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is more capital efficient for Goldman Sachs to share
            its ownership with other investors,' said Michael Sherwood,
            vice chairman of New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in the
            statement. 'Rothesay Life can continue its growth as a
            standalone business with the benefit of diversified ownership.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures about 12 billion pounds ($19.4 billion) of
            insurance contracts for companies including IAG SA's British
            Airways and General Motors Co. (GM)'s U.K. division. Firms such as
            Rothesay promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a
            certain age and use derivatives to hedge the risk. The insurer
            typically receives a portion of the pension plan's assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in August that it planned to sell a
            majority stake in Rothesay, which has about $9.66 billion in
            assets, in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent
            capital rules. The bank has already sold about 80 percent of
            Global Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in
            Bermuda, to institutions and high-net-worth clients this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Strong Pipeline' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Loudiadis said in the statement that diversifying
            Rothesay's shareholder base was the next stage in the company's
            strategy, adding that the insurer will continue to work on a
            'strong pipeline' of opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chad Pike, Blackstone (BX)'s head of tactical opportunities in
            Europe, said in the statement that Rothesay was 'well placed'
            to benefit from the growth potential in the U.K. pension
            insurance market as interest rates climb. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tay Lim Hock, president of GIC's Special Investment. said
            the fund sees 'long-term potential' of the expanding market
            for Rothesay's pension-insurance business. GIC is the world's
            eighth-biggest state fund with an estimated $248 billion of
            assets under management, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund
            Institute's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mass. Mutual, which invested 100 million pounds in
            subordinated debt in Rothesay earlier this year, said demand for
            risk management from U.K. defined-benefit pension plans offered
            significant growth opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Completion of the deal is subject to regulatory and
            antitrust approvals, which includes the U.K.'s Prudential
            Regulation Authority, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;LEG Immobilien AG (LEG) fell the most in a
            month after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Perry Capital LLC sold
            7 million shares in the residential landlord. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG dropped 3 percent to 42.28 euros, the biggest decline
            since Sept. 23. Goldman's Whitehall Street Real Estate money
            manager and Perry Capital, which took LEG public in February,
            raised 289 million euros selling the shares to institutional
            investors for 41.25 euros each. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LEG, Germany's second-largest property company by market

            sale today was managed by Goldman and represents about 13.2
            percent of the company's share capital. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fed Stimulus Still Makes Sense for Economy, Goldman's Cohn Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve may not taper
            its stimulus efforts soon as the U.S. economy has failed to pick
            up and inflation remains low, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
            Gary D. Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you look at where we are economically, versus where we
            were a year ago, we're virtually in the exact same place,'
            Cohn, 53, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview with
            Stephanie Ruhle. 'So if quantitative easing made sense a year
            ago, it probably still makes sense today.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed decided in September not to taper its $85 billion
            in monthly bond purchases designed to help stimulate the U.S.
            economy. The decision's announcement sent the yield on 10-year
            Treasury bonds down the most in almost a year. Federal Reserve
            Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Oct. 21 that this
            month's government shutdown amid congressional budget
            disagreement will probably further delay tapering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decline in the U.S. jobless rate to 7.2 percent in
            September occurred as people gave up looking for work, not by
            creation of 'real jobs,' Cohn said. Janet Yellen, President
            Barack Obama's nominee to be the next Fed chairman, understands
            the competing objectives the central bank faces, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They're in a position where they know they can't
            quantitatively ease forever, they know they're building a bigger
            and bigger balance sheet, but their No. 1 objective is to try
            and grow the U.S. economy,' Cohn said. 'I do believe
            eventually they will taper. Eventually can be a very long
            time.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Daimler, Facebook, Goldman Sachs: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Daimler AG (DAI)'s contention that a patent covering sleepiness detection for vehicle operators is
            invalid, a federal appeals court said, upholding a lower court ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The German
            automaker was sued for patent infringement in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, in October 2010.
            Ibormeith IP LLC of Longview, Texas, claimed that Daimler's Mercedes-Benz Attention Assist driver drowsiness
            detector infringed patent 6,313,749. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The patent, issued in November 2001, was acquired
            by Ibormeith LLC in August 2010, and then transferred to Ibormeith IP LLC the same month the suit was filed.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibormeith is named for the Irish princess Caer Ibormeith, who would change into a swan
            every other year. According to court filings, the company is one of the entities that make up Medici
            Portfolio LLC, a patent firm begun by Michael Connolly, a former partner in Chicago's McDermott Will Emery
            LLP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In September 2012, U.S. District Judge Faith S. Hochberg ruled the claims in the
            patent were too indefinite. Ibormeith then filed an appeal with the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals
            for the Federal Circuit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The appeals court said yesterday that the lower court's ruling
            was correct. The patent didn't disclose enough information to make it possible to understand how the
            technology would work, the court said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The patent application was handled by Young
            Thompson of Alexandria, Virginia, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Ibormeith IP LLC v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, 13-1007, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
            Federal Circuit. The lower-court case is Ibormeith IP LLC v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, 10-cv-05378, U.S.
            District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;BlackBerry Bidders Weigh Patent Hoard
            Valued at Up to $3 Billion &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even as BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)'s sales tumbled in recent
            years, the company continued amassing patents, building an intellectual-property hoard that's now central to
            its effort to entice bidders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The struggling smartphone maker received 986 patents last
            year, a 49 percent increase from 2011, according to figures compiled by the Intellectual Property Owners
            Association. BlackBerry's patents are valued at from $1 billion to $3 billion, depending on how many have
            been licensed out, analysts and patent experts estimate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working in BlackBerry's favor:
            The patents cover similar technology as Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s intellectual property, and much of the portfolio
            is only a few years old. The downside is that the market for such assets has cooled. Previous patent buyers
            such as Apple and Google Inc. amassed broad portfolios in patent deals two years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This
            is an incredibly volatile market,' said Ron Laurie, managing director of Palo Alto, California-based
            Inflexion Point Strategy, who advises companies on patents. 'It all depends on perceived demand and
            strategic value.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lisette Kwong, a Waterloo, Ontario-based spokeswoman for BlackBerry,
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more patent news, click here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trademark
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Samsung's Trademark Application Points to Extended Warranty &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung
            Electronics Co. (005930) filed for a U.S. trademark that may indicate the Korean maker of mobile devices is
            planning to compete with rival Apple Inc. over extended warranties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both companies
            manufacture smart phones and are presently involved in a patent dispute in federal court in San Jose,
            California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samsung is seeking to register 'Samsung Protection Plus' as a trademark for
            'providing extended warranties on consumer electronic products and appliances,' according to database of the
            U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The trademark application was filed Oct. 15. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple
            Inc.'s extended warranty is known as Applecare Protection Plan. The Cupertino, California-based company was
            sued by a Belgian consumer group in January over its extended warranty practices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            lawsuit alleges that Apple misled consumers by advertising that its products had a one-year warranty and
            then selling a two-year extended warranty. European Union customers have an automatic two-year warranty on
            products they buy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Facebook Tells Developer to Dismantle BreakYourFacebook site &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) sent a cease-and-desist e-mail to the developer of a tool that allows users to
            take scheduled breaks from the social media site. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The developer, Cody Romano, said on
            his blog that he received the e-mail from the Menlo Park, California-based company objecting to the web app
            he created, 'Break Your Facebook.' He said he created the tool in the wake of recent revelations about the
            National Security Administration's alleged snooping into users e-mail and social-media accounts, and the
            'frenetic pace' and 'poor quality' of Facebook's News Feed feature. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the e-mail,
            Facebook said that Romano's breakyourfacebook.com domain name infringes the social media company's
            trademarks, and demanded that he quit using the name 'Break Your Facebook' and disable the website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company also warned him not to 'sell, offer to sell, or transfer' the domain name to a third
            party, and told him he should let his Internet domain name registration expire. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romano
            said on his website that he knows he has to 'break my app and let the domain die' because he lacks the
            resources for a legal battle with Facebook. He did take issue with the tone of the cease-and-desist letter,
            saying that he was 'turned off' by the e-mail's language. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more trademark news, click

            Infringers of Film &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Norwegian director is having the last laugh at those who are
            downloading a copy of his film through a website that uses the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol, according
            to the TorrentFreak anti-copyright news website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johan Kaos uploaded a copy of his film
            'Pornopung' to the Pirate Bay website, saying he thought the movie would end up there anyway and he wanted
            to have some fun with those who used the site to download and share it without authorization, according to
            TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The film is a comedy about two men who give a third man advice about how
            to be attractive to women, with one of their tips involving removal of body hair from his genitals,
            TorrentFreak reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaos said the film he uploaded to PirateBay starts with 10
            minutes of the film just as he made it, with the remaining two hours showing only an image of a shaven
            scrotum, according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more copyright news, click here. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trade
            Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Ordered to Advance Ex-Programmer Fees for N.Y.
            Case &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) must advance computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov
            the legal fees he needs to fight New York state charges that he stole confidential source code from the
            company, a federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs at this time doesn't have to pay the fees
            Aleynikov incurred defending federal charges that led to his conviction and imprisonment before the verdict
            was overturned, said U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty in Newark, New Jersey. He said the two sides must
            engage in a pretrial exchange of evidence on that question. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Immediate advancement of
            fees is required, subject only to an unsecured undertaking to repay them if the applicant is unsuccessful in
            the underlying litigation,' McNulty said in an opinion made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov
            was convicted in federal court in Manhattan in 2010 of stealing hundreds of thousands of lines of code and
            sentenced to 97 months in prison. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was ordered freed in February 2012 when the U.S.
            Court of Appeals in New York reversed his conviction. In August of that year, he was arraigned in Manhattan
            on state charges of unlawful use of scientific material and duplication of computer-related material. He was
            the subject of a sympathetic profile in Vanity Fair magazine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which
            employed Aleynikov from May 2007 through June 2009, argued that it didn't have to pay his fees in a state
            prosecution because he wasn't an officer of the company, even though he was a vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McNulty disagreed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It may be the case that Goldman (or the industry of which
            it is a part) has been profligate in conferring the title of vice president,' the judge wrote. 'If so,
            Goldman must bear the consequences of that profligacy. Goldman might easily have chosen to be more sparing
            with job titles, or to confer them in some other way.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for
            New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Aleynikov
            v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 12-cv-05994, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Hires Citigroup's Smith as Asia Electronic Trading Head</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            hired Ian M. Smith from Citigroup (C) Inc. as head of electronic
            trading for the Asia-Pacific region as the U.S. firm seeks to
            expand its system globally. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith, most recently head of execution trading for the
            region at Citigroup, will be a managing director, said Connie
            Ling, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs. The
            hiring follows the departure of Shuya Kekke, former co-head of
            electronic trading, from Goldman Sachs earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith becomes the fifth senior electronic trading
            specialist the Wall Street firm has recruited in the region in
            the past two years, spanning from Japan to Australia, Ling said.
            New York-based Goldman Sachs spent a year developing an
            electronic trading system for corporate bonds called GSessions
            that started operating in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have been building out our electronic trading platform
            in Asia, tripling the number of clients on the algorithmic
            customization platform and adding access to three new markets in
            the past year,' Canute Dalmasse, Asia-Pacific head of execution
            services, wrote in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Smith will be based in Hong Kong, Ling said. Before
            Citigroup, he worked at Credit Suisse Group AG and led the
            development of the Swiss bank's algorithmic trading strategies
            and related product development, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;James Griffiths, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Citigroup,
            declined to comment on Smith's departure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) are among securities
            firms that bought execution-management systems starting in the
            mid-2000s to give clients including mutual funds access to
            exchanges and algorithms, or trading strategies that allow them
            to process larger orders in small pieces over a preset period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has added six people to its Asia electronic
            trading team in the past three months, including Kekke. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Cohn Says He Doesn't Know Why FICC Unit Underperformed</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
            Gary Cohn said while he doesn't know what drove his firm's
            underperformance in fixed-income trading in the third quarter,
            he's vowing to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't know precisely why we had a tough quarter, but
            the results are in, and I can tell you we had a tough quarter in
            fixed-income,' Cohn said today in a Bloomberg Television
            interview with Stephanie Ruhle. 'We're very committed, we're
            going to redouble or triple our efforts in fixed-income. We
            believe ourselves to be a very powerful, very dominant, top-tier
            fixed-income shop.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs reported last week that fixed-income,
            currency and commodities, or FICC, trading revenue dropped 47
            percent to $1.29 billion, the lowest since the financial crisis.
            The firm's share of revenue among the five largest Wall Street
            banks is 17 percent so far this year, down from 22 percent in
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve's decision not to taper its stimulus
            efforts didn't cause a big change for the firm's business, Cohn,
            53, said. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said last week
            that clients were cautious leading up to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For Goldman, it meant business as usual,' Cohn said.
            'Not tapering is the world that we've been in for the last
            year.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Efforts to improve in fixed-income will include hiring, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're looking for seasoned traders, we're replenishing
            our trading supply,' Cohn said. 'We're looking for seasoned
            salespeople, salespeople who have real client relationships and
            can come in and help us manage our client relationships.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Raises $226 Million by Selling Shares in TCS IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised $226
            million selling stock in TCS Group Holding Plc (TCS)'s initial public
            offering yesterday, cashing out almost two-thirds of its stake
            in the Russian consumer lender. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank, through its ELQ Investors II unit,
            sold 12.9 million of its 21 million shares, reducing its stake
            from 12 percent to 4.5 percent. A spokesman for the New York-based company declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is vying to compete with Russia's leading
            foreign investment banks such as Deutsche Bank AG and Citigroup
            Inc. by using the more than $1 billion it invested in private
            equity since 2007 as leverage to win deals and woo the Kremlin
            for roles in asset sales. Goldman Sachs bought stakes in Russian
            companies on condition that it gets equity and debt mandates
            later, a person familiar with the deals said in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's nothing sinister here,' Jason Hurwitz, senior
            banking analyst at Alfa Bank, said today in a phone interview.
            'It is not the first time Goldman Sachs has shown greater
            foresight than other investment banks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS priced the IPO at $17.50 a global depositary receipt,
            valuing the firm at $3.2 billion. The GDRs fell 0.8 percent to
            $18.15 today in London. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and other investment banks managing the sale
            may benefit from selling as much as $163 million in additional
            shares, TCS said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Branchless Bank &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCS, founded as Tinkoff Credit Systems in 2007 by serial
            entrepreneur Oleg Tinkov, has issued more than 2 million cards
            in Russia and now ranks fifth in lending, according to the
            company. The branchless bank is modeled on McLean, Virginia-based Capital One Financial Corp. (COF), which
            pioneered the
            distribution of credit cards through direct mail, which Tinkov
            said he learned about firsthand while living in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tinkov has created and sold businesses including a retail
            electronics chain, frozen-food producer brewery and restaurants. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired its initial 10 percent holding in
            Tinkoff in October 2007, according to a prospectus. In 2008,
            Swedish fund Vostok Nafta Investment Ltd. became a shareholder,
            and Baring Vostok, Russia's most successful private equity firm,
            and Ukraine's Horizon Capital bought stakes last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The IPO, the largest by a Russian company in 11 months,
            values the lender at 4 to 5 times book value, according to
            Natalia Berezina, banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp. OAO
            Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, trades at about 1.3 times
            book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Heightened Risks' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's consumer-finance banks face an increase in bad
            loans in the unsecured retail-lending market and TCS is among
            those with 'heightened risks,' Moody's Investors Service said
            in a Sept. 12 report. Russian bank lending to households rose 34
            percent as of Aug. 1 from a year earlier, while unsecured loans
            surged 39 percent, according to central bank data. That's higher
            than the regulator deems 'comfortable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank is 'an unique story, but in my opinion in current
            conditions of overheated consumer lending, Central Bank
            regulations, rising asset-quality problems and general cost of
            equity for Russia and Russian banks, it's still too high a price
            for Tinkoff,' Berezina, who values TCS at $1.6 billion, said in
            e-mailed comments. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Scene Last Night: Goldman's Evans, Ruscha, Whitney Nudes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The naked men and women at the Whitney Museum of American Art gala stood on a platform surrounded
            by luggage from sponsor Louis Vuitton. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the fully clothed last night were Citadel
            LLC Chief Executive Officer Ken Griffin; J. Michael Evans, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. vice chairman who
            will leave his post at year's end; and William Ruprecht, the CEO of Sotheby's. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Guests
            looked on as artists sketched the models, capturing the curve of an arm or a fine rump resting on the
            trunks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one gawked too long during the party held at Skylight at Moynihan Station,
            which raised more than $2.7 million. There were just too many distractions, from the strips of bacon being
            served at the bar (crispy, not caramelized, by the way), to greeting Leonard Lauder, one of the Whitney's
            biggest patrons. There were also chances to spot actress Michelle Williams, dealer Larry Gagosian and
            honoree Ed Ruscha. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the evening, Ruscha was sketching a portrait of Salman
            Rushdie's girlfriend, Missy Brody, fully clothed. She provided Ruscha with a notebook -- every guest
            received one at their place setting along with a Sharpie. Ruscha made a text portrait. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During
            dinner, the artist received a gift from the Whitney: a booklet titled 'A Few Various Colorful People and a
            Glass of Milk,' filled with personal notes collected for the occasion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Aunt Gertie &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said he would read every page, then made a joke about the Metropolitan Museum of Art renting
            space at 'Aunt Gertie's boardinghouse' -- the Whitney's uptown building, being vacated next year when it
            moves to the Meatpacking District. 'Gertie' of course is Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who founded the museum
            after the Met turned down a gift of hundreds of paintings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ruscha got to choose the
            musical entertainment: David Byrne, who serenaded guests with three songs including 'I Should Watch TV,'
            from his album with St. Vincent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goody bag offered a copy of the album as well as a
            copy of Ruscha's book 'They Called Her Styrene,' donated by the owners of Phaidon Press, Apollo Global
            Management LLC (APO)'s Leon Black and his wife, Debra Black. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the after party,
            watching artists sketch live models was replaced by a photo booth where people could pose with signs showing
            phrases from Ruscha paintings, such as: 'Headlights Are Similar to People's Eyes' and 'Those of Us Who Have
            Double Parked.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The guests here included actresses Taylor Schilling, who stars in
            'Orange Is the New Black,' and Zoe Kravitz. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Amanda Gordon is a writer and photographer

        <headline>Goldman Billionaire Picks Leading Rally on Profits: India Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bonds of companies controlled by
            billionaires Sunil Mittal and Mukesh Ambani, added in August to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s most-favored list, helped investors
            to the biggest gains in 20 months for India's dollar debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Notes of the nation's issuers returned 5.6 percent since
            Aug. 30, according to JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Asian Credit Index,
            poised for the best performance since a 7.9 percent advance in
            the first two months of 2012. The premium investors pay over
            Treasuries has slid 57 basis points in the period, the biggest
            decline after Indonesia and Pakistan among 13 Asian markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors are signaling their faith in Indian borrowers
            after the central bank stemmed a rout in the rupee and companies
            in the benchmark SP BSE Sensex index of shares surpassed or
            matched profit forecasts. Indian debt also rallied on bets the
            Federal Reserve will delay tapering its record stimulus that has
            buoyed emerging-market assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is some positivity after the earnings,' Philipp Good, who manages $800 million including
            Indian debt in Zurich
            at Fisch Asset Management Ltd., said in an Oct. 22 telephone
            interview. 'Investors are probably of the opinion that
            impending risks to India and emerging markets have receded,
            therefore the bonds become more appealing in the short term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mittal, Ambani &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mittal's Bharti Airtel Ltd. andAmbani's Reliance
            Industries Ltd. are the only Indian companies on Goldman's
            most-favored list of Asian credit, an Oct. 16 report by the
            U.S. bank shows. The lender added them on Aug. 26 amid a selloff
            in emerging-market debt triggered by speculation the Fed will
            cut its monthly bond purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bharti's 5.125 percent notes maturing March 2023 have
            returned 6.5 percent this month, data compiled by Bloomberg
            show, the most among 67 Indian bonds included in JPMorgan's
            Asian Credit Index. The yield fell to 5.93 percent from a record
            8.04 percent on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reliance's 5.4 percent bonds due February 2022 gained 4.3
            percent in October, pushing the yield to 4.94 percent from an
            unprecedented 6.088 percent on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income at nine 30 Sensex members, including Reliance,
            that have published results for the quarter through Sept. 30 met
            or beat forecasts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About half
            of them trailed forecasts in the April-June quarter. Bharti
            reports Oct. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Some Optimism' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Earnings have surprised and may have prompted some
            rethinking,' M. Narendra, Chairman of Chennai-based Indian
            Overseas Bank Ltd., said in a telephone interview yesterday.
            'The rupee's reversal has also brought back some optimism. The
            economy and markets were probably not on as weak a footing as
            they were made out to be.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average of insuring bonds eight Indian issuers against
            non-payment using credit-default swaps has dropped 58 basis
            points from this year's high of 395 touched last month,
            according to CMA data, the day the Reserve Bank of India
            unexpectedly raised borrowing costs for the first time since
            2011. The RBI will raise the repurchase rate by 50 basis points,
            or 0.50 percentage point, to 8 percent at its Oct. 29 meeting to
            contain inflation induced by food prices, Deutsche Bank AG said
            in an Oct. 16 report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The rupee has climbed 12 percent from its record-low
            reached on Aug. 28, the most among Asia's 11 most traded
            currencies. It was little changed today at 61.56 per dollar as
            of 1:54 p.m. Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
            compiled by Bloomberg. Benchmark 10-year sovereign yield fell
            four basis points to 8.60 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Risk Events' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While returns on Indian corporate debt have rebounded from
            a four-month slump that ended in August, foreign investors still
            need to negotiate several 'risk events,' Desmond Soon, a
            Singapore-based money manager at Western Asset Management Co.,
            said in an interview yesterday. These include national elections
            due in 2014 and the start of the Fed's tapering, he said &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Indian companies have raised $25.6 billion in overseas
            loans and bonds this year through Oct. 22, 14 percent more than
            a year earlier. HDFC Bank Ltd. completed a $500 million of
            three-year notes offering yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The average yield on Indian dollar debt fell to 5.55
            percent on Oct. 23, according to a JPMorgan index, the least
            since Aug. 1. That compares a 9.53 percent average for five-year
            rupee notes, indicative yields compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Indian corporate asset prices will benefit as risk
            appetite is increasing gradually,' said Zsolt Papp, who helps
            oversees $2.6 billion of emerging-market debt at Union Bancaire
            Privee in Zurich. 'Pessimism is waning.' Non-bank securities
            are likely to outperform lenders, he said by phone on Oct. 22. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Blankfein Says IPO Market is 'Alive and Well'</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The market for initial public
            offerings is 'alive and well' and it's a great time for
            companies to raise financing, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
            Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told CNBC today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The IPO market is alive and well,' Blankfein, 59, said
            in the interview. 'We have high equity prices, we have an
            economy that's growing -- people would like it to be growing at
            a faster rate, but there's no doubt it's growing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein declined to comment on the planned IPO for
            Twitter Inc. (TWTR), which Goldman Sachs is managing. Goldman Sachs
            ranks first among managers of global equity offerings so far
            this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Commodities Co-Head Magid Shenouda Leaving Bank</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Magid N. Shenouda, Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc.'s London-based co-head of commodities trading, is
            leaving the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shenouda joined the firm in 1999 and became a partner in
            2008, according to an internal memo from Pablo Salame and
            Isabelle Ealet, co-heads of the trading division. Michael DuVally, a company spokesman, confirmed the
            contents of the memo
            and declined to elaborate. Gregory A. Agran is Shenouda's New
            York-based co-head. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is among banks whose ability to participate
            in the commodities markets is being examined by the Federal
            Reserve. The Fed is conducting a review while U.S. lawmakers and
            regulators raise concerns that banks might abuse their various
            roles in physical commodities markets, or that the businesses
            pose risks to the firms' financial stability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We have a long, long investment in the commodity
            business, and we have at this stage no intention of selling our
            business,' Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in a
            conference call this month after Goldman Sachs reported third-quarter results. 'We're very committed to our
            clients here. And
            so we'll just work with the regulators.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shenouda previously ran the New York-based bank's European
            crude oil and products trading unit and its European gas and
            power trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He has been responsible for driving several key
            acquisitions, as well as the expansion of our business
            activities into new regions and products, including the build-out of our energy, coal, freight and emissions
            franchise,'
            Ealet and Salame wrote in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spark Spread reported on the departure earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Cuts OPEC Crude Output Forecasts For 2013 on Libya</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said crude
            production in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
            will decline this year by more than the bank previously
            estimated because of renewed disruptions in Libya. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OPEC's output will decline by 760,000 barrels per day from
            last year, according to the bank, which had previously projected
            an annual loss of 570,000 a day. The supply reduction will keep
            Brent futures supported at $110 a barrel despite an accumulation
            in oil inventories amid weaker-than-expected fuel demand,
            Goldman said. Libya's production will remain capped at 650,000
            barrels a day this year as a result of political disputes, the
            bank predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The conflicts in the country's east appear more permanent
            in nature given the diversity of involved parties, which makes a
            near-term resolution seem increasingly unlikely,' analysts led
            by Jeffrey Currie in New York said in a note to clients on Oct.
            28. 'We believe that production levels will only recover to
            around 1.3 million barrels per day through 2014.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Output losses among OPEC members have buoyed oil prices
            against muted growth in world oil demand, which expanded by
            400,000 barrels a day in the third quarter from a year ago
            compared with 1.5 million a day in the second, Goldman said.
            Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest member, will need to keep
            output near record levels above 10 million barrels a day for the
            rest of the year to compensate for the disruptions in other OPEC
            nations, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Further Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OPEC's production slumped to a near two-year low of less
            than 30 million barrels a day in September as labor unrest
            crippled Libya's export facilities and as Iraq conducted
            maintenance at its southern oil terminal, the International
            Energy Agency said on Oct. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The potential for further disruptions in Libya' means
            that crude prices may exceed the bank's current forecasts,
            according to Goldman. Brent, trading today at $108.95 a barrel
            on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, will advance to
            about $110 in three months' time, Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Production from OPEC member Iran will also remain
            'materially affected by international sanctions through to the
            end of the year and 2014,' despite the resumption of talks with
            western governments about the country's nuclear program, Goldman
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs's Armstrong Is Said to Leave Firm for Comcast Job</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Jason Armstrong, a 13-year veteran
            of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who oversaw analysis of phone and
            cable companies, is leaving to become Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)'s head of
            investor relations, according to a person with knowledge of the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Armstrong starts in late January, said the person, who
            asked not to be identified because the move hasn't been publicly
            announced. Comcast, based in Philadelphia, is the largest U.S.
            cable company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As the lead analyst for the investment bank's North
            American communications equity research group, Armstrong covered
            the pay-TV industry, including Comcast, Dish Network Corp. and
            Time Warner Cable Inc., as well as their competitors in the
            phone industry, such as ATT Inc. and Verizon Communications
            Inc. He joined Goldman in 2000 and was previously with Ernst
            Young LLP in Chicago, according to Goldman's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment, as did John Demming, a spokesman for
            Comcast. Armstrong couldn't be reached for comment through his
            Goldman Sachs office and e-mail address. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Armstrong had a buy rating on Comcast for most of the past
            four years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Morgan Stanley Beating Goldman in Retail: Russia Overnigh</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;One day after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. reiterated its preference for X5 Retail Group NV among
            Russian retailers, Morgan Stanley (MS) reinforced its backing of
            competitor OAO Magnit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traders are siding with Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global depositary receipts of Magnit gained 0.6 percent to
            $64.50 by 9:46 a.m. in London, after touching a record high of
            8,719 rubles in Moscow yesterday. The stock has gained 80
            percent this year, the best performance on Russia's benchmark
            Micex index. X5 slipped 1 percent to $16.08 yesterday and was
            set for a 9.8 percent decline in 2013. The Bloomberg Russia-US
            Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S.
            slumped 0.5 percent as futures on Russia's RTS Index fell in

            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley boosted its price estimate on Magnit's
            global depositary receipts by 23 percent, reiterating a buy
            rating, a day after Goldman Sachs said a turnaround in the
            management of X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE), Russia's second-largest
            retailer, will boost competition for the No.1 supermarket chain.
            Magnit said on Oct. 28 that profit margin rose to a record high
            while X5's third-quarter revenue fell short of analysts
            estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I side with Morgan Stanley as we own Magnit and believe
            in its potential to expand in Russian regions and further
            increase revenue,' Mansur Mammadov, a money manager at Kazimir
            Partners, which oversees $300 million in assets, said in a phone
            interview from Moscow Oct. 30. 'I was surprised with Goldman's
            report on X5. It will take another several quarters for X5 to
            actually turn around.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Moscow Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;X5, which has lost almost two-thirds of its market value
            since mid-2011, formed a new management team as it plans to
            refurbish stores in a bid to bolster sales. X5 seeks to improve
            focus on the 'individual needs' of its store formats and
            improve supplier relationships, Chief Executive Officer Stephan
            Ducharme told investors Oct. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magnit, owned by billionaire Sergey Galitskiy, plans to
            expand in Moscow and St. Petersburg, traditionally X5
            strongholds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley increased its price estimate on Magnit to
            $80 per London-listed depositary receipt. Goldman said in an
            Oct. 29 note that X5 'can win the race', reiterating a buy on
            the stock and keeping it on the bank's list of the most
            recommended shares in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tanya Barkas, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
            said the firm's office in London, which was closed after regular
            business hours, oversees Magnit coverage. An e-mailed message to
            Anna Leath, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in New York, wasn't
            immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ADRs of OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY), the worst-performing Russian oil
            stock in New York in at the time, have jumped 18 percent since
            Goldman Sachs predicted in August that it would rebound on
            prospects of higher output and dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magnit, which reported a record-high profit margin in the
            third quarter, can double its market share in the next three to
            four years, Natalya Kolupaeva, senior analyst at ZAO
            Raiffeisenbank at Moscow, said by phone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Magnit keeps amazing everyone,' Kolupaeva said. 'It's a
            stable, clear and transparent company. It is a leader in the
            market and will remain a leader. X5 can rise from the ashes, but
            the risks it may fail to do so are also great.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kolupaeva rates both stocks a hold and is in the process of
            revising her recommendation on Magnit, she said, declining to
            comment on whether she plans to upgrade it to a buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Moscow-listed shares of Magnit are a real opportunity for
            investors,' Kolupaeva said. 'The gap between London and Moscow
            is still wide and will shrink over time because the local shares
            become more accessible by foreign investors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;London Premium &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Magnit's London depositary receipts traded at an 18 percent
            premium to the Moscow-listed shares yesterday, the narrowest gap
            since April 10, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
            Raiffeisenbank's Kolupaeva expects the gap will shrink to about
            5 percent in a year from now. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While none of the analysts covering Magnit recommends
            selling it, sell recommendation on X5 rose to an eight-month
            high in October, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch raised X5 to a buy on Oct. 24, 10 days
            after JPMorgan Chase Co. and HSBC Holdings Plc cut their
            recommendations to the equivalent of sell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'World's major banks have been lately showing a very
            different vision on how to play Russia's retail sector,'
            Mammadov said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge dropped to 103.69. The Market
            Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S.-traded exchange-traded fund
            that holds Russian shares, slipped 0.7 percent to $29.34. The
            RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
            index futures, dropped 7 percent to 21.70 today, while RTS
            stock-index futures decreased 0.5 percent to 147,960 in U.S.
            hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;United Co. Rusal, a Moscow-based aluminum producer dropped
            0.8 percent to HK$2.37 in Hong Kong trading. The MSCI Asia
            Pacific Index fell 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Loaned Banco Espirito Santo Funds in July</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) loaned
            Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo SA $835 million in July, just
            weeks before the group's units sought creditor protection in a
            cascade of insolvencies that resulted in the lender's bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made the loan through Oak Finance Luxembourg
            SA, an investment company that raised funds destined for a
            Venezuelan oil refinery project, according to the unit's offer
            document. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banco Espirito Santo, once Portugal's biggest publicly
            traded lender by market value, was bailed out Aug. 3 after it
            disclosed potential losses on loans to other Grupo Espirito
            Santo companies and regulators ordered the lender to raise more
            capital. The bank was split in two with deposits and healthy
            assets becoming Novo Banco in a bailout by the central bank's
            Resolution Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Goldman
            Sachs sold some of Oak Finance's securities at a loss to hedge
            funds and the New York-based firm is still holding some of the
            debt, citing a person it didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An official for Goldman Sachs in London declined to
            comment. Novo Banco does not comment about operations that
            involve clients, said a spokeswoman, who asked not to be named
            in line with company policy. Officials for Portugal's central
            bank didn't have an immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had agreed to the funding on May 16, the
            offer document shows. Four days later, Banco Espirito Santo
            warned investors buying stock in its rights offer of
            irregularities in the accounts of a parent company and that the
            'serious financial situation' of the parent firm could be
            damaging to the bank's reputation. Regulators are examining how
            the group's companies helped fund each other. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs International, the
            European division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), said first-half
            pretax profit fell 60 percent, hurt by a charge linked to
            employee compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pretax profit dropped to $335.4 million in the first six
            months of the year from $847.5 million in the year-earlier
            period, the company said in a filing. Revenue fell 5 percent to
            $3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Administrative expenses rose to $2.5 billion from $2.1
            billion, due to a $516 million charge as the company marked the
            value of stock-based compensation to market prices. Shares of
            the New York-based parent have climbed more than 19 percent so
            far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue from institutional client services, the fixed
            income, currencies and commodities division, fell 11 percent to
            $2.2 billion, while investment banking revenue climbed 41
            percent to $591.4 million, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is the top-ranked mergers
            adviser in Western Europe, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The firm is advising Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) on its 7.7
            billion euro ($10.2 billion) takeover offer for German cable
            company Kabel Deutschland Holding AG. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court tossed out a ruling that would have forced Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) to
            pay the legal fees of a former computer programmer charged with stealing the bank's trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov is accused of taking the high-speed trading code on his last day of work at
            Goldman Sachs. He's fighting charges in state court in New York after his federal conviction was overturned.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, whose case was the inspiration for Michael Lewis's bestseller 'Flash Boys,'
            sued in September 2012 in New Jersey seeking more than $2.4 million from Goldman Sachs to cover his legal
            fees. Goldman Sachs appealed a judge's ruling in Aleynikov's favor. The appeal raised the issue of whether
            Aleynikov was an officer at the company, which would have required the bank under its bylaws to cover his
            legal costs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Ex-Goldman Trader Loses in Bid for $5 Million More in Bonus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's
            unclear whether the term officer would include Aleynikov, who held the title of vice president at one of
            Goldman's units but had no supervisory or leadership responsibilities, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
            Philadelphia said today in a split ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The bylaws are ambiguous and genuine issues
            of material fact preclude summary judgment,' the court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Goldman Trader Loses in Bid for $5 Million More in Bonus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) trader Deeb Salem struck out in his pursuit of almost $5
            million in bonus money on top of $8.25 million he received in 2010 as a Manhattan judge upheld an
            arbitration panel's decision favoring the bank. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice Eileen
            Bransten today rejected Salem's request to set aside the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority panel's
            decision to dismiss his claim and granted Goldman Sachs's request to seal portions of the dispute with the
            former trader. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem claimed he helped the bank earn more than $7 billion and told the
            arbitration panel on Feb. 25 that he was one of the most sought-after investment professionals in the
            mortgage industry. The panel, described by Salem's lawyer as a 'kangaroo court,' didn't let Salem call some
            of Goldman Sachs' top trading executives as witnesses, resulting in a miscarriage of justice, according to
            the petition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: 'Flash Boys' Programmer Loses in Goldman Fight Over Fees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'What
            you have failed to do in your application before this court is show any evidence whatsoever that the
            material that was excluded was pertinent to this case,' Bransten told Salem's lawyer Jonathan Sack. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In transcripts of the hearing, filed by Sack along with the petition and later sealed, Salem said
            his $8.25 million bonus in 2010 didn't reflect his contributions and that he was led to believe he would be
            paid at least $13 million. The trader argued his bonus was unfairly docked because of a written warning he
            received about his 2007 self-evaluation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Upside Down &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sack argued
            in court today that the arbitration panel refused to hear testimony from all of the witnesses he wanted to
            use in his client's effort to show that he had been promised additional compensation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Essentially
            what this panel did is they turned the process on its head,' he told Bransten. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bransten
            said Salem was unable to meet an 'extremely heavy burden' to set aside the order. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            judge also criticized Sack for including arbitration transcripts with his petition despite knowing that the
            proceedings were confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You cannot tell me you're not aware of what is usually
            done,' she said. Much of the information in the transcript is 'nobody's business but Goldman Sachs's,' she
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Appeal Planned &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sack said in an e-mail after the hearing that
            he planned to appeal, without specifying which part of the judge's decision he was addressing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tiffany Galvin, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mail that the bank was
            'pleased that the arbitration panel's decision was upheld.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In June, Galvin, called the
            claims over the compensation 'utterly ridiculous' and 'unworthy of any further response.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salem
            initially sought more than $20 million in unpaid compensation in the arbitration and later amended that to a
            total of more than $16 million, including the bonus money and almost $7 million in deferred stock that he
            said he was led to believe he would get. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January 2011, Salem told his mother, who was
            staying with him because her house had burned down on Christmas, that he expected at least $13 million for
            2010, according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average managing director in the areas of
            mortgage-backed securities, structured credit and proprietary trading received a 2009 bonus of $750,000 to
            $1.1 million, according to an Options Group report at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a
            court filing in August that the panel gave Salem 'a full opportunity to present his evidence, obviated the
            needless burden of further witnesses, and followed the law in rendering an award denying the claim.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is not unfair to dismiss a meritless claim,' the bank said in the filing. Additional witnesses
            'would make absolutely no difference whatsoever to the outcome.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, after
            rising almost 1.3 percent, closed down 0.1 percent at $179.60. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case is Salem v.
            Goldman Sachs Co., 651811-2014, New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Names Bernstein to Lead Venture Capital Client Group</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the top
            global merger adviser this year, named Stuart Bernstein as head
            of a group that focuses on venture capital investors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernstein, a partner who joined Goldman Sachs in 1986, will
            remain global head of the clean technology and renewables group,
            according to a memo from investment banking co-heads Richard J. Gnodde, 53, David Solomon, 51, and John S.
            Weinberg, 56. David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, confirmed the
            contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The venture capital community has become a strategically
            important constituent of the division's client franchise and is
            critical to our ability to serve the needs of our emerging
            growth clients,' according to the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bernstein, 49, previously ran the equity underwriting group
            that serves financial institutions, according to the memo. He
            became a managing director in 1999 and a partner the next year.
            As head of clean technology, Bernstein has led Goldman Sachs's
            effort to finance $40 billion of renewable energy in a decade,
            which began last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Frank L. Walters led the venture capital group before
            taking the same role at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
            America Corp. earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top adviser on announced global
            mergers this year and the leading equity underwriter, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank is the third-ranked
            adviser on global technology deals, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

            public. The firm paid about 774 million euros ($1 billion) for
            the businesses in 2007 and renamed the group Infinitas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Goldman Sachs has been appointed to help explore
            strategic options' for Noordhoff Uitgevers, Infinitas said in
            an e-mailed statement today. Officials at Bridgepoint and
            Goldman Sachs declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dutch undersecretary for education yesterday announced
            plans to stop funding free textbooks for secondary school
            pupils. From 2015, parents will be required to pay as much as
            300 euros a year for books. Noordhoff sells textbooks for Dutch
            children to use from primary school through university. The
            company has 355 employees and has also developed study kits used
            on the iPad, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
            plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
            to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
            after 10 years. The firms usually charge a management fee of as
            much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
            investments. Bridgepoint raised 4.8 billion euros for its fourth
            pool of capital in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Wirecard Gains as Goldman Forecasts Strong Revenue Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wirecard AG (WDI), a provider of software
            for online payments, rose to the highest price since its initial
            public offering in 2000 after Goldman Sachs predicted the stock
            will gain as the company builds business in Europe and Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wirecard jumped as much as 5.2 percent and was up 3.1
            percent at 25.08 euros at 1:36 p.m. in Frankfurt, for the
            biggest gain among the 110 stocks on the HDAX Index. (HDAX) Trading
            volume was almost double the three-month daily average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There is a 65 billion-euro mobile commerce related
            opportunity for Wirecard spread across mobile carriers,
            retailers and other verticals,' S.K. Prasad Borra, a London-based analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a note
            today. 'We
            expect Wirecard to augment its strong presence in Germany and
            across Europe with continued expansion in Asia.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its recommendation on Aschheim, Germany-based Wirecard to buy from neutral, and put
            the stock on its
            'conviction buy list.' Prasad Borra predicted the shares will
            rise to 38 euros in 12 months, a potential 56 percent gain from
            the closing price yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Severe Pound Selloff on Scots Breakaway Vote</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A win for Scottish nationalists seeking a breakaway from the U.K. may have 'severe' consequences in
            the short term and spark a pound selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Kevin Daly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The uncertainty about whether Scotland will leave the sterling monetary union could create' a
            crisis similar to the one that almost splintered the euro area, Daly said today in an interview with Anna
            Edwards on Bloomberg Television's 'On The Move' program in London. 'In the long run, there's no reason to
            believe why Scotland couldn't prosper as an independent country. Our concerns are predominantly about the
            short-to-medium term, but those concerns are pretty severe.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Scotland enters the
            final days of campaigning before the Sept. 18 plebiscite, the currency market is taking notice after a
            YouGov Plc poll for the Sept. 2 editions of the Times and Sun newspapers showed the pro-U.K. camp leading by
            six percentage points once undecided voters are stripped out, from being 14 points ahead in the last YouGov
            poll conducted on Aug. 12-15. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scotland's Bid for Independence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After
            initially dismissing the referendum, investors 'realize that this is going to be disruptive in an economic
            sense if the Yes camp win,' John Normand, head of foreign-exchange and international-rates strategy at
            JPMorgan Chase Co., told Edwards and Mark Barton on the 'Countdown' program. 'People realize increasingly
            that the undecided camp is big enough to swing this' and that is why 'volatility is picking up,' he said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Volatility Surge &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Implied one-month volatility in sterling against
            the dollar surged 23 percent after the survey was released, the most since 2008. Sterling has declined since
            then and today fell 0.2 percent to $1.6432 today, having reached $1.6440 yesterday, the weakest since Feb.
            12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question of whether a go-it-alone Scotland will be able to keep the pound in
            partnership with the remaining parts of the U.K. has dominated the independence debate with all the major
            parties in Westminster saying they would oppose it. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has argued they
            would change their view once negotiations began after a Yes vote and has said Scotland would refuse to pay
            its share of the U.K. national debt if they didn't give in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The aftermath of a vote for
            separation 'will be absolutely chaotic,' Andy Brough, executive director at Schroder Investment Management
            in London, said on Bloomberg Television. 'Companies will have to sit down and rational thinking will have to
            be made.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Hire Banks for Debut Islamic Bond Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
            its first foray into Islamic capital markets three years after
            starting a sukuk program that it never used. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Five banks including the New York-based lender will manage
            the dollar-denominated offering via JANY Sukuk Co., four people
            with knowledge of the deal said. A benchmark-sized sale may
            follow, they said, asking not to be identified as the plan is
            private. Goldman Sachs in 2011 created a $2 billion program that
            faced criticism from some Islamic advisers for not ensuring debt
            would be traded at par value, as required by Shariah. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is joining a growing number of issuers
            seeking to tap demand among Muslim investors in an industry that
            Ernst Young LLP forecasts will double in the five years
            through 2018 to $3.4 trillion. The U.K. became the first non-Muslim country to issue Islamic bonds in June
            with a sale that
            lured bids for more than 10 times the amount offered. Luxembourg
            and Hong Kong are also planning investor meetings for similar
            offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's so much pent up demand in the sukuk space,'
            Thomas Christie, the Dubai-based head of fixed income at
            Prometheus Capital Finance Ltd., said by phone. 'Given the
            controversy in the past, it would be interesting to see what
            structure they're going to use, how they're going to use the
            funds and how the Islamic community reacts to it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Previous Attempt &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The planned security will take the form of Sukuk al Wakala,
            a Shariah-compliant structure in which one party entrusts
            another to act on its behalf. Standard Poor's rated the issue
            A-, the seventh-highest investment grade, the company said in an
            e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lender established a sukuk program three years ago
            based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
            plus mark-up transaction, that was approved for listing on the
            Irish Stock Exchange by the Central Bank of Ireland. Murabaha
            certificates can only be bought and sold at par value because
            they represent a future claim on the underlying assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The program, blessed by eight of the world's top Islamic
            scholars, became entangled in a debate on whether it met
            Shariah-compliant guidelines and over lack of clarity on how
            Goldman Sachs planned to use the funds it raised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Pent-Up Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will hold investor meetings in the Middle
            East on Sept. 10 and 11 and a so-called Regulation S
            transaction, which exempts overseas offerings from registration
            requirements under the SEC Securities Act of 1933, may follow,
            the people said. A benchmark-sized sale usually raises at least
            $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notes would 'probably price tighter' than Goldman
            Sachs' conventional bonds due to the 'pent-up demand in the
            sukuk space,' Christie of Prometheus said. The average yield on
            debt that complies with Muslim tenets dropped 63 basis points
            this year to 2.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since May,
            according to the Deutsche Bank Sukuk Bond Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Islamic lenders will have 70 million customers by 2018, up
            from 38 million last year, according to Ernst Young forecasts.
            Shariah-compliant banking assets will double in that period,
            according to the advisory company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;South Africa, Bangladesh &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;South Africa last month picked banks for its debut sale of
            Islamic notes, while Bangladesh and the Russian region of
            Tatarstan are planning inaugural sales. In addition to itself,
            Goldman Sachs hired Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, National Bank
            of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd. and NCB Capital to
            manage the offering, the people said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Demand for Islamic bonds is surging helped by ample
            liquidity at banks. Al Hilal Bank PJSC, an Islamic lender owned
            by the Abu Dhabi government, received about $5 billion in bids
            for its $500 million sale of perpetual sukuk in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Clearly, this is a good time and the demand for sukuk is
            still there,' Apostolos Bantis, credit analyst at Commerzbank
            AG in Dubai, said by phone. 'This does actually indicate that
            the asset class of sukuk is expanding and diversifying.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JANY Sukuk will enter a murabaha agreement for 49 percent
            of the issued amount and a wakala agreement for the remaining 51
            percent with J. Aron Co., a Goldman Sachs subsidiary,
            according to SP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sells Largest Structured Note in Six Years Outside U.S.</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) sold its
            largest structured notes outside the U.S. in six years, raising
            115 million euros ($151.5 million) from securities tied to
            swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 15-year notes will initially pay coupons based on the
            rate for 10-year euro constant-maturity swaps, benchmarks that
            measure the cost of exchanging floating rate and fixed interest
            payments through the swaps market, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The sale was the New York-based bank's largest
            outside its home market since it raised 230 million euros in
            August 2007, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
            declined to comment on the notes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors in the securities will receive an additional
            payment from the fourth year onwards based on the difference
            between 10-and two-year swap rates, Bloomberg data show. The
            1.61 percentage-point gap between the two rates is the widest
            since January 2011, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A constant maturity swap is a variation of an interest rate
            swap where the floating interest portion is reset periodically. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman raised $552.8 million from selling 31 structured
            notes outside the U.S. this year, up from $503.4 million in the
            same period last year, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR), the
            investment bank founded by former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
            Roger Altman, hired Matthew McAskin as a senior managing
            director in its health-care group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McAskin was previously co-head of health-care services
            investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was
            named a managing director in 2007, Evercore said today in a
            statement. He'll be based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merger and acquisition bankers have pointed to the health-care industry to lead a pickup in global
            deals. Announced
            transaction volume across all industries has risen in the second
            and third quarters this year, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Health care represents one of the largest and most active
            industries for investment-banking services,' Chief Executive
            Officer Ralph Schlosstein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McAskin received an undergraduate degree in economics from
            the University of Michigan and MBA degrees from Columbia
            Business School and London Business School, according to the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are extraordinarily pleased to have a banker of

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) and Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. were among 15 securities firms shortlisted to
            manage the initial public offering of Japan Post Holdings Co. as
            the government embarks on potentially its biggest asset sale. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (MS) Securities Co., Daiwa
            Securities Group Inc. (8601) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were also among the
            companies that passed the first phase of the selection process,
            the Ministry of Finance said in a statement today. It plans to
            select about 10 firms to manage the IPO, slated for next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The candidates will have to find ways to divest the postal,
            banking and insurance giant without disrupting the stock market.
            Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration hasn't said how much
            it expects to raise from the sale, which will help fund
            reconstruction from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The
            offering will probably take place in phases and may exceed 4
            trillion yen ($38 billion) in total, the previous government's
            Postal Reform Minister Mikio Shimoji said in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The other foreign companies that made the cut are Barclays
            Plc, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), UBS AG (UBSN) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the
            statement showed. The remaining domestic firms are SMBC Nikko

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Mark Schwartz, chairman of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc.'s Asia-Pacific operations, bought a rare free-standing mansion on Manhattan's Upper West
            Side for $14 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The deal for the 12,000-square-foot (1,115-square-meter)
            home on Riverside Drive closed Aug. 8, according to records made
            public yesterday by New York City's Department of Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The four-story house at the corner of 107th Street is the
            last fully detached single-family mansion in Manhattan,
            according to the property listing by Tod Mercy of the Corcoran
            Group brokerage. It was built in 1909 by William Tuthill, the
            designer of Carnegie Hall, and was commissioned by Morris
            Schinasi, a Turkish tobacco baron. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz, 59, agreed to pay 3.7 percent more than the last

            website StreetEasy.com. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 12-bedroom, 11-bathroom house, surrounded by private
            gardens and overlooking the Hudson River, 'is an exquisite
            French Renaissance jewel box executed in pristine white marble,
            boasting deep-green roof tiles and bronze grills on the
            balconies and at the main entrance,' according to the Corcoran
            listing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mercy, the broker, didn't return a call seeking comment.
            Schwartz, who is based in Beijing, didn't immediately respond to
            an e-mail after normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Goldman Return &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz left New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001,
            returning in June 2012. In the interim, he served as chief
            executive officer of Soros Fund Management and later chairman of
            MissionPoint Capital Partners, according to his biography on the
            bank's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schwartz first joined Goldman Sachs's investment-banking
            unit in 1979 and became chairman of the Asia business and a
            member of the company's management committee in 1999, the same
            year that Goldman Sachs went public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The seller of the mansion was the estates of Hans and
            Beverly Smit. Hans Smit was an emeritus professor at Columbia
            Law School who died in January 2012 at the age of 84, according
            to the university's website. His wife, Beverly Smit, a teacher
            at the Spence School, died five weeks later, according to a
            notice published in the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said in Talks With GIC, Blackstone on Rothesay Stakes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks
            to sell a majority stake in its European insurance business to
            Singapore's GIC Pte and Blackstone (BX) Group LP, according to a
            person with knowledge of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, and
            Blackstone, the world's biggest private-equity firm, may each
            buy a stake of about 30 percent in Rothesay Life Ltd., a London-based insurer run by Goldman Sachs partner
            Addy Loudiadis, said
            the person, who asked not to be identified because the
            negotiations are private. Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance
            Co. may also buy 6 percent, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said last month that it expects to sell a
            majority stake in Rothesay, which has about $9.66 billion in
            assets, in the next 12 months as banks face more stringent
            capital rules. Goldman Sachs sold about 80 percent of Global
            Atlantic Financial Group, a reinsurance business in Bermuda, to
            institutions and high-net worth clients this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported earlier today that Goldman
            Sachs was set to sell almost two-thirds of the pensions insurer
            to GIC, Blackstone and Mass. Mutual. Spokesmen for Goldman
            Sachs, Rothesay, GIC and Blackstone declined to comment. A
            spokesman for Mass. Mutual, based in Springfield, Massachusetts,
            couldn't be reached outside of normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mass. Mutual invested 100 million pounds ($156 million) in
            subordinated debt in Rothesay this year. The transaction is some
            way off from being completed, with an announcement unlikely
            before the end of September, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rothesay insures about 12 billion pounds of insurance
            contracts for companies including IAG SA's British Airways and
            General Motors Co. (GM)'s U.K. division. Firms such as Rothesay
            promise to pay pensions if retirees live beyond a certain age
            and then use derivatives to try to hedge the risk. The insurer
            typically receives a portion of the pension plan's assets. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Earnings to Get Boost From Mobileye Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s third-quarter earnings stand to get a boost from a 2007 investment
            in an automated-driving technology company that's more than doubled since a July initial public offering.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bank owned 17.5 percent of Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV (MBLY), mostly through its
            Goldman Sachs Investment Partners hedge fund, before it helped take the firm public in July, according to
            filings related to the IPO. The shares priced at $25, above the initial range of $17 to $19, and rose as
            high as $53.91 today. That advance may lead to a third-quarter gain for New York-based Goldman Sachs of more
            than $200 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While calm markets have
            suppressed Goldman Sachs's trading business, they have been a boon to investments the firm makes with its
            own money. The investing and lending unit earned the most profit of Goldman Sachs's four major business
            segments in the 12 months ended in June, and gains in companies that went public drove better-than-expected
            earnings last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs 'has successfully established a strategy that
            should allow the firm to continue in the principal-investing business in the coming years,' Brad Hintz, a
            Sanford C. Bernstein Co. analyst, said in a July note. 'The wisdom of that strategy is clear,' Hintz said,
            as such gains in the second quarter 'once again provided an unanticipated boost to performance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs invested $100 million in Mobileye in 2007, the first year the company had its
            driver-assistance EyeQ chip and algorithms put in new cars. The firm hasn't said whether it added to that
            investment. Mobileye's image-sensing technology uses a single camera to capture and display a vehicle's
            surroundings, and anticipates potential collisions, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Honda,
            Tesla &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mobileye, whose customers include Honda Motor Co. (7267) and luxury
            electric-carmaker Tesla Motors Inc., has leaped from a $1.5 billion valuation in July 2013 to a market
            capitalization of $10.8 billion today. Its $1 billion IPO on July 31 was the biggest in the U.S. by an
            Israeli company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment shows the potential of Goldman Sachs's strategy of
            serving as adviser and principal with key clients. The bank generated about $18 million from its role as
            lead underwriter of Mobileye's IPO, according to a regulatory filing, and advised the company last year when
            it received investments from firms including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a
            spokesman for the company, declined to comment on the firm's holdings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investing and
            lending unit includes direct investments in debt and equity, stakes in private equity and hedge funds, and
            loans to corporate and individual clients. The unit earned $4.26 billion before taxes in the 12 months ended
            in June, or 37 percent of the firm's total, on $7.14 billion in revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Equity Gains
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains from equity investments drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter and in
            the final three months of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in July that two-thirds of the
            $1.25 billion in equity gains for the second quarter came from companies that went public or experienced an
            event that resulted in a new valuation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A $200 million gain would represent about a
            quarter of equity investment revenue for the average of the past 10 quarters. The firm had $18 billion of
            investments in private equity and $4.33 billion in public stock as of June 30. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts
            including Citigroup Inc.'s Keith Horowitz have said that shareholders give Goldman Sachs less credit for
            investing and lending gains because they're seen as volatile and difficult to predict. Schwartz has said the
            activities are 'core competencies' of the firm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;ELQ Investors &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eighty-six
            percent of Goldman Sachs's stake in Mobileye before the IPO was held by Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, a
            hedge fund that includes client money and the bank's own capital. The other 14 percent was a principal
            investment held through a subsidiary named ELQ Investors II Ltd. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ELQ sold $36 million of
            its stake in the IPO, leaving it with 1.7 percent of Mobileye's shares. The remaining stake would be worth
            $176 million at the Sept. 5 closing price if ELQ didn't sell more shares after the IPO. GSIP sold $105
            million of Mobileye stock in the IPO, leaving it with 12.3 percent of the company, which would be worth $1.3
            billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third-quarter gain for Goldman Sachs will depend on a number of factors,
            including how Mobileye's stock trades in September and whether ELQ and GSIP maintain their post-IPO stakes.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares gained as much as 7.9 percent today, after General Motors Co. said it would
            introduce a Cadillac model in two years that uses automated-driving technology. Detroit-based GM didn't name
            potential technology suppliers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobileye Valuation &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs,
            which marks its investments to the current market price, hasn't disclosed at what price it valued Mobileye
            on June 30. If it marked at $18, the midpoint of the original IPO range, ELQ would currently have a gain of
            $122 million. GSIP would have a $842 million gain, and Goldman Sachs would receive some cut of that as an
            investor in the fund. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's own money accounted for about 35 percent of the
            $7.5 billion in the fund in October 2009, according to marketing documents at the time. Since then, the
            assets have shrunk and Goldman Sachs has pulled money from hedge funds to eventually comply with the Volcker
            Rule, which sets a 3 percent limit for how much of a fund can be a bank's own capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            fund, which is managed by Kenneth Eberts, Raanan Agus and Nick Advani, had about $5 billion in assets at the
            end of June, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. DuVally declined to say how much of the fund is
            the bank's own money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Volcker Rule &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the unpredictability of
            investing and lending stems from Goldman's need to exit $12 billion of the $14 billion in fund investments
            it had at the end of 2013 to comply with the Volcker Rule, Hintz wrote in June. The bank has said it will
            make those sales at a pace that won't hurt other investors in the funds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gains like the
            one from GSIP's stake in Mobileye may provide an incentive for Goldman Sachs to take its time in redeeming
            its capital. Mobileye has jumped more than 35 percent since the start of trading on Aug. 26. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs's own research analyst, Alexander Duval, issued his first recommendation of the stock that day. He
            rated the shares neutral. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Sukuk Lures Mideast's Top Fund Manager: Islamic Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will
            probably succeed in its latest attempt to sell sukuk as
            investors clamor for Islamic bonds, according to the manager of
            the Middle East and Africa's best performing sukuk fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Buyers 'have to look at different opportunities' with
            demand outpacing supply, according to Abdul Kadir Hussain, who
            oversees about $700 million as the chief executive officer of
            Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. Goldman Sachs will meet investors in
            the region this week before potentially selling a dollar-denominated, benchmark-sized issue through its unit
            JANY Sukuk
            Co., people with knowledge of the deal said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The New York-based lender's first foray into the Islamic
            capital markets three years ago ended without a sale amid
            criticism from scholars about the structure of its sukuk program
            and the use of funds raised. This time the planned security will
            be a Sukuk al Wakala, where one party entrusts another to act on
            its behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We'll definitely look at it,' Hussain said in a phone
            interview from Dubai yesterday. 'The structure was an issue'
            last time and there were 'a lot of other issuers in the
            market,' he said. 'Now the market is a lot tighter and there
            is more capital.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors bid for 10-times the 200 million pounds ($327
            million) that the U.K. sold in its debut offering in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Best Funds &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mashreq's Capital DA01 and Al-Islami Income Fund are the
            two best performing Islamic fixed-income funds in the Middle
            East and Africa this year among 19 tracked by Bloomberg. They've
            returned 7.7 percent and 6 percent respectively, compared with
            5.6 percent for third placed Al Hilal Bank's Global Sukuk Fund,
            the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Like the U.K. issue, the Goldman Sachs deal is a
            broadening of the sukuk market issuer base, and like that issue
            this deal isn't about the pricing or the valuation,' Hussain
            said. 'It's about the signal that it sends.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Average global sukuk yields declined 64 basis points this
            year to 2.78 percent last week, according to an index from
            Deutsche Bank AG. That compares with a 61 basis-point decline to
            5.08 percent in average yields for emerging-market corporate
            debt tracked by JPMorgan Chase Co. indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Remaining Shy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs established a $2 billion program in 2011
            based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
            plus mark-up transaction. The program, blessed by eight of the
            world's top Islamic scholars, became entangled in a debate on
            whether it met Shariah-compliant guidelines because it didn't
            ensure debt was traded at par, and it didn't clarify how it
            planned to use the funds raised. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This time Goldman Sachs along with Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank
            PJSC, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd.
            and NCB Capital will manage the new offering, the people said.
            It plans to meet investors in the Middle East for two days
            starting Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If the investors conclude that Goldman Sachs is going to
            take this money into their books and use it to finance their
            conventional activities, then the investors are going to remain
            a little bit shy,' Harris Irfan, managing director at European
            Islamic Investment Bank, said by phone from London yesterday,
            noting the new structure has solved the par-value obstacle, but
            not issues with transparency. 'I do hope they will be more
            transparent on the flow of money,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Main Critic &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, the presence of ADIB on the deal is 'very
            positive' as it was one of the main critics of Goldman Sachs'
            earlier plans, Irfan said. The Shariah boards of ADIB and EIIB
            share one scholar, according to the lenders' websites. ADIB's
            outsourced public relations company didn't answer e-mailed
            questions yesterday, and Sophie Ramsay, spokeswoman for Goldman
            Sachs in London, declined to comment by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About $72 billion of sukuk have been sold globally in the
            year through yesterday, compared with $80 billion in the same
            period in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Islamic finance is a growing market both in terms of
            issuers and investors,' Hussain said. 'Goldman Sachs clearly
            has decided that they want to play a role in this market both as
            an issuer and I am sure also as an arranger and adviser.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Says Buy Global Stocks After ECB's Stimulus</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank's decision
            to boost stimulus measures was enough to make Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. change its mind about the short-term fate of the
            global equity market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank raised its three-month rating on stocks to
            overweight, the equivalent of buy, according to a report from
            its portfolio strategy group. Higher bond yields pose less of an
            imminent threat to equities following the ECB's decision last
            week to unexpectedly lower key interest rates and implement an
            asset-buying plan, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The upgrade is a reversal of a call made by Goldman Sachs
            on July 26, when the firm cut its three-month rating on stocks
            to neutral amid expectations that government bond yields would
            increase. The bank maintained its 12-month overweight rating for
            stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sees 'lower risk' from bonds following the
            ECB decision, analysts led by chief global equity strategist
            Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a Sept. 5 client note. 'The net
            effect of the policy action from here will be positive for
            equity markets,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The MSCI All-Country World Index has rebounded 3.6 percent
            over the last month since falling to an 11-week low on Aug. 7.
            The gauge declined 0.4 percent at 10:39 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global equity measure climbed 0.2 percent last week as
            the ECB reduced its three main interest rates by 10 basis
            points, lowering the benchmark rate to 0.05 percent and the
            deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi
            said the central bank will announce details of an asset-backed
            securities program after its October rate-setting meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.1 percent on the day of
            the Sept. 4 announcement as two-year note yields fell below zero
            in eight countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs isn't alone in getting more bullish on
            equities. Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Adam Parker announced today an increase in the firm's
            12-month SP
            500 forecast to 2,125. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank AG strategist
            David Bianco increased his year-end SP 500 target to 2,050 from
            1,850 and his 2015 projection to 2,150. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>MetLife Adds Goldman's D'Agosta in Asset-Management Push</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;MetLife Inc. (MET), the largest U.S. life
            insurer, said Nela D'Agosta joined from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            as a managing director in the unit investing funds for
            institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;D'Agosta will focus on marketing and relationships for
            MetLife, the New York-based insurer said in a statement today.
            She was a senior relationship manager at Goldman Sachs's asset
            management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;MetLife created the unit for institutional investors last
            year as Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian works to boost
            fee income and scales back from capital-intensive businesses
            like variable annuities. The insurer said last month that it won
            a commitment of as much as $5 billion from SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)
            for commercial mortgage loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Nela will bring strong global experience in sales,
            relationship management and team leadership,' Lou Jug, head of
            investor services for MetLife Investment Management, said in the
            statement. 'Her extensive relationship management
            expertise and client service capabilities are valuable assets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier at Goldman Sachs, D'Agosta was global head of
            insurance client relationship management. Andrea Raphael, a
            spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;D'Agosta also worked at JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) and graduated from Villanova University in 1990 with a
            bachelor's degree in business administration. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Leads Wall Street Tapping Taiwan Insurer Cashpile</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks including Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are rushing to issue U.S.
            dollar bonds in Taiwan after a rule change unlocked $586 billion
            of funds held by the island's insurance companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman sold $974 million of 30-year notes last month in
            the largest such issuance on the island, leading $7.3 billion in
            greenback debt offers this year, versus zero a year earlier.
            J.P. Morgan Securities LLC estimates U.S. issuers can obtain
            lower costs than they would at home, after lawmakers in May
            excluded locally issued foreign-currency bonds from a 45 percent
            cap on the amount insurance firms can invest in overseas assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taiwanese insurers' yearly premium income has more than
            doubled in the past decade as China's export-manufacturing boom
            boosted the island's wealth. Their hunt for fixed-income
            investments has cut the 10-year sovereign yield 116 basis points
            in the past 10 years to 1.71 percent, the 13th-lowest globally,
            compared with 2.49 percent in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With Taiwan's very low benchmark-rate environment, a lot
            of domestic-currency investments have low yields,' said Godwin Chang, head of Taiwan at Societe Generale AG,
            which sold $1.21
            billion of bonds in the territory this year. 'Life insurers are
            better off having more foreign-currency investments.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Negative Spread &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The central bank cut its policy rate to a record low 1.25
            percent in 2009 and maintained it at 1.875 percent in the past
            13 quarters. As domestic rates fell, life insurance firms
            boosted holdings of foreign assets to 44 percent as of June 30
            from 38 percent at the end of 2011, according to the Taiwan
            Insurance Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurance industry's 3.8 percent weighted average
            liability cost was significantly higher than its recurring
            investment yield of 2.8 percent in 2013, according to a June
            presentation by the financial regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman issued its zero-coupon, 30-year bonds at a price to
            yield 4.96 percent last week. Morgan Stanley's notes due 2044
            paid a coupon of 4.7 percent and Citigroup's similar-maturity,
            zero-coupon debt was sold at 4.88 percent. All of the dollar
            notes sold on the island since May's amendment are callable by
            the issuer and mature in 20 or 30 years, while 74 percent pay
            zero coupon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign-currency notes issued in Taiwan are called
            Formosa bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Callable notes are popular among insurers, which can demand
            higher yields to boost returns, J.P. Morgan strategists led by
            Joshua Younger wrote in an Aug. 22 note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Because they are considered domestic investments from a
            regulatory perspective, Formosa bonds are generally compared
            against Taiwan dollar-denominated fixed-income products,' the
            strategists wrote. 'With Taiwan dollar rates quite low by
            comparison, yield-sensitive investors are likely to lower their
            return targets for U.S. dollar callable Formosa bonds relative
            to those registered overseas.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bond Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The May 20 amendment also spurred issuances in yuan bonds,
            with lenders such as Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of
            China Ltd. selling 9.3 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of debt in
            Taiwan since then, compared with 1.5 billion yuan in the first
            four months of 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Local insurers' total annual premium income grew an average
            8 percent in each of the last 10 years to NT$2.7 trillion ($90
            billion) in 2013 from NT$1.2 trillion in 2003, according to
            Financial Supervisory Commission data. Premiums collected added
            up to 17.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, the
            world's highest penetration rate, a Swiss Re Ltd. report shows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Insurer Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For insurers whose investments abroad haven't yet neared
            the 45 percent limit, the locally issued foreign-currency bonds
            are not the most attractive. Cathay Life Insurance Co. (2882), the
            largest in the industry with NT$4.3 trillion of assets, has
            bought very few of the foreign-currency notes as they offer
            rates lower than similar securities overseas, executive vice
            president Joseph Wang said at an Aug. 29 briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other companies have been more enthusiastic. Shinkong
            Insurance Co. (2850) has spent NT$42.8 billion on locally issued
            foreign debt and plans to buy more to boost returns, according
            to an Aug. 28 presentation. Fubon Life Insurance Co. aims to
            increase its holdings to NT$100 billion within a year, the
            Economic Daily News reported on Aug. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All of the dollar debt sold in Taiwan since May's rule
            change has been bought by the insurance industry, according to
            Mark Liu, Taipei-based head of global markets at Societe
            Generale. The French bank is speaking with European companies
            both in and outside the financial sector regarding bond
            issuances in Taiwan, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Expectations Tempered &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This may be a good time to sell debt as borrowing costs
            will probably rise. Eight of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg poll
            expect Taiwan to raise its policy rate at least once by the end
            of this year. The island's economy is showing signs of a
            recovery this year. Data yesterday showed exports grew 9.6
            percent in August, the most in 20 months. Sixty-six percent of
            Taiwan's shipments went to China, which this week posted a
            record trade surplus for August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., 62 of 74 economists in another survey see a
            Federal Reserve interest-rate increase by the third quarter of
            next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have already tempered their expectations for a
            rate increase, according to Cosmas Lu, chief executive officer
            at the Taipei branch of Barclays Plc, which lists its $600
            million of 30-year bonds on the bond exchange GreTai Securities
            Market today. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have declined 54
            basis points in 2014 as Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled the
            monetary authority's commitment to low borrowing costs amid
            mixed U.S. economic data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Taiwan's investors have been pretty quiet in the first
            half of the year, waiting for interest rates to rise, which
            didn't happen,' Lu said in an Aug. 27 phone interview. 'So
            they're very cash-rich and they realize they can't wait forever.
            There's definitely very big demand from investors.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>CSN and Gerdau Seen by Goldman Losing in Iron-Ore Rout</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron-ore's plunge to five-year lows
            would make exports from Brazilian producers including Cia.
            Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) and Gerdau SA (GGBR4) unprofitable, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 50 million metric tons a year of Brazilian iron-ore
            output would be unprofitable at prices that last week fell below
            $84 a ton for the first time since 2009, Goldman analysts led by
            Marcelo Aguiar said in a research note today. While local
            transport costs probably will decline and make exports more
            viable, the reduction won't be immediate, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Miners that don't have their own railway and port
            operations 'will likely be under strong pressure in the short-and near-term given the low iron-ore price
            environment,' the
            Sao Paulo-based analysts wrote. 'The low profitability of
            Brazilian small and mid-size iron-ore miners could be a barrier
            for export volume growth from Brazil in the near term.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron-ore, the key ingredient in the production of steel,
            has lost 38 percent this year on signs of weakening demand
            growth in China as Vale SA, BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto
            Group, the three largest producers, increase output, betting
            higher volumes will force less competitive mines to close. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Qingdao
            fell 0.6 percent to $83.50 a dry ton today, the lowest since
            Sept. 22, 2009, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Projects' Jeopardy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gerdau declined to comment on Goldman's analysis when
            contacted by Bloomberg News today. CSN, the second-largest
            listed Brazilian iron-ore company, didn't reply to an e-mail
            seeking comment. Either did Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
            SA, also listed by Goldman as a producer that would have export
            losses at current prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Only Rio de Janeiro-based Vale (VALE5), the world's largest iron-ore producer, would generate
            positive operating cash flow in
            Brazil at current prices, Goldman also said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Several Brazil iron-ore projects expected to start
            producing in the next five years would be canceled or halted
            because of the lower prices of the raw material, putting at risk
            about 45 million tons a year of expansion potential, the
            analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dow Jones Industrials to Add Goldman Sachs, Nike Shares</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Visa (V) Inc.
            and Nike Inc. (NKE) will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU),
            replacing Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Alcoa
            Inc. (AA) in the biggest reshuffling since April 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes will boost the influence of banking and
            computer companies in the 30-member gauge as the fifth-biggest
            U.S. bank by assets and the largest payment network join seven
            other financial and technology firms, such as JPMorgan Chase
            Co. and Cisco Systems Inc. Bank of America exits even after
            rising 109 percent in 2012, the Dow's largest gain. The changes
            will take effect after the close on Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moves announced today by a committee that includes editors
            of the Wall Street Journal will give extra influence to the
            average's newest members, due to the way the gauge is designed.
            Since Dow proportions are determined by stock price rather than
            market value, shares of Visa and Goldman Sachs, which trade
            above $160 apiece, will have about seven times the weighting as
            the constituents they replace. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Dow is going to look and act very differently,' Dan Greenhaus, a strategist at BTIG LLC, said
            in a note to clients.
            'Visa would become the second-most important stock in the index
            and Goldman Sachs the third-most important.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs in $2 Billion Partnership With N.Y. Pension</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;New York state's pension fund is
            giving Goldman Sachs Asset Management $2 billion to invest in
            global stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's the first time the $180.7 billion fund has formed such
            a partnership, state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, the pension's
            sole trustee, said today in a statement. In addition to
            investing the funds with equity managers, the unit of Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will also provide advice across the pension's
            remaining $98 billion equity portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Identifying new opportunities is key to the continued
            growth of the fund's long-term value,' DiNapoli said. It will
            give the pension 'full access to world-class global equity
            investment opportunities and the nimbleness to take advantage of
            them on a timely basis.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York joins public pension funds including New Jersey,
            New York City and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas in
            making big allocations of capital to investment managers that
            can be deployed more quickly and across different strategies.
            Such separately managed accounts offer cheaper fees and more
            control for investors, who in turn agree to commit large sums
            for a decade or more. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Landmark' Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Texas committed as much as $3 billion each to KKR
            Co. (KKR) and Apollo Global Management LLC, while New Jersey gave as
            much as $1.5 billion to Blackstone Group LP. New Jersey's State
            Investment Council said the deal would save the state about $120
            million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's partnership with New York state is the
            largest it has ever done, said Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for
            the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2008, the South Carolina Retirement System Investment
            Commission created several strategic partnerships, including one
            with Goldman Sachs. The firm managed $1.15 billion as of June
            30, 2013, according to a report from the state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, New York-based Goldman Sachs received $500 million
            from the Alaska Permanent Fund to manage with a goal of
            returning 5 percentage points more than inflation. The bank had
            $725 million at the end of July, and had returned 8.03 percent
            in the past three years, ahead of its 6.79 percent target,
            according to a report from the Alaskan fund. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Timothy O'Neill and Eric Lane, global co-heads of the
            investment management division at Goldman Sachs, said the New
            York deal is a 'landmark assignment' for the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are excited to provide customized access to our broad
            open-architecture platform, due diligence expertise and
            portfolio construction capabilities,' they said jointly in the
            e-mailed statement from DiNapoli. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's alternative investments and manager
            selection group, run by Chris Kojima, supervises $156 billion,
            Raphael said. The unit selects and performs due diligence on
            long-only portfolio managers for institutional investors, in

        <headline>Goldman Calls End to Iron Age After 'Dramatic' Drop in Ore Price</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore declined sooner than
            expected this year as supplies exceeded demand and prices are
            unlikely to recover, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
            which said 2014 will mark the end of a so-called iron age. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This year 'is the inflection point where new production
            capacity finally catches up with demand growth, and profit
            margins begin their reversion to the historical mean,' analysts
            Christian Lelong and Amber Cai wrote in a report today titled:
            'The end of the Iron Age.' The 2016 forecast for seaborne ore
            was cut to $79 a metric ton from $82 and the 2017 outlook was
            reduced to $78 from $85, according to the New-York based bank,
            which stuck with a forecast for $80 next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The raw material tumbled into a bear market this year as
            the biggest producers including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group expanded low-cost output, betting higher volumes would
            more than offset
            falling prices while less competitive mines were forced to
            close. The decline in prices came sooner than expected,
            according to Goldman, which said in November that iron ore would
            probably drop at least 15 percent this year. The commodity is
            seen in a structural downtrend, JPMorgan Chase Co. said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The price decline has been dramatic, but a weak demand
            outlook in China and the structural nature of the surplus make a
            recovery unlikely,' Lelong and Cai wrote. 'Lower prices for
            iron ore and steel are unlikely to boost demand in a material
            way. Instead, the day when steel production in China will peak
            gets ever closer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lowest Level &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Qingdao
            fell 39 percent to $82.22 a dry ton this year, the lowest level
            since September 2009, according to data from Metal Bulletin Ltd.
            The Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM), which doesn't include iron ore as
            a member, lost 2 percent in the period. Within the index,
            soybeans fell the most. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before the surplus emerged, iron ore supplies were tight
            and producers had above-trend profits even as costs increased,
            according to Lelong and Cai. That period, dubbed by the bank as
            the Iron Age, is now ending, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The current exploitation phase in iron ore could last for
            a decade,' the analysts wrote. 'Iron ore markets went through
            a 20-year period of declining prices in real terms during the
            previous exploitation phase that ended in 2004.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global surplus will more than triple to 163 million
            tons in 2015 from 52 million tons this year, according to
            Goldman. The glut was seen expanding to 245 million tons in 2016
            295 million tons in 2017 and 334 million tons in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Producers' View &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest suppliers see higher prices. Ore may increase
            as the higher-cost output exits the market, Nev Power, chief
            executive officer of Perth-based Fortescue (FMG) Metals Group Ltd.,
            said in an Aug. 20 interview on Bloomberg Television. Vale SA
            also sees prices rebounding as supply growth slows and mines
            close, Jose Carlos Martins, the Rio de Janeiro-based company's
            head of ferrous and strategy, said on July 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Iron ore may see a dramatic recovery this half, Paul Gait,
            an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a report on July 9,
            citing factors including a seasonal increase in the second six
            months and an end to China's policy tightening. Asia's largest
            economy accounts for about 67 percent of seaborne demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit growth in China missed estimates in July and new-home prices fell in almost all the cities
            the government tracks,
            putting pressure on policy makers to step up stimulus as they
            seek to meet an economic growth target of 7.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 110 million tons of global supply will close next
            year and a further 75 million tons in 2016, Goldman estimated in
            the report. While the majority of closures would be in China,
            seaborne producers will not go unscathed, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Exceed Demand' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'New seaborne iron ore supply delivered into China is
            expected to exceed demand growth over the next three to four
            years,' Daniel Kang, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase Co. in Hong
            Kong, said by e-mail in response to Bloomberg questions. 'In
            short, we see iron ore in a structural downtrend.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rio Tinto, the biggest supplier after Vale, plans to boost
            output to more than 330 million tons in 2015, according to a
            company estimate. Vale will raise production 8.4 percent to 348
            million tons in 2015. BHP Billiton Ltd. sees an 8.9 percent
            increase from its Western Australian mines in the year from July
            1, while Fortescue may boost shipments by 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortescue's stock declined 32 percent in Australia this
            year, while in London Rio shares lost 5 percent and BHP rose 0.4
            percent. In Brazil, Vale dropped 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The shift into structural oversupply is barely six months
            old but seaborne prices have already declined 38 percent year-to-date,' Lelong and Cai wrote. 'Rather than
            representing the
            trough for this cycle, we believe the downward pressure is set
            to continue.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Barclays Hires Ex-Goldman Banker Eldabag for Middle East</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC) appointed former
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive Khaled Eldabag as co-head for
            investment banking in the Middle East and North Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eldabag will work with David Nataf, who was promoted as the
            regional co-head for investment banking in the region, according
            to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The contents of
            the memo were confirmed by a Dubai-based spokesman for the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays is pursuing growth in emerging markets such as the
            Middle East and Africa as accelerating economies revive investor
            demand for share sales and mergers and acquisitions. The bank
            appointed Makram Azar as chairman for the Middle East and North
            Africa in June, replacing chief executive John Vitalo, who left
            in April to join former Barclays CEO Robert Diamond's Africa
            investment vehicle Atlas Mara Co-Nvest Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Khaled and David's appointment build on the success of
            Barclays' investment banking franchise in MENA,' Azar said in
            an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News. 'This is a clear
            reflection of our commitment to grow Barclays' business in the
            region.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investment banks in the Middle East are reviving banking
            hires as deal activity picks up, after cutting jobs during the
            global financial crisis. UBS AG is relocating Alberto Palombi,
            head of the investment bank's global sovereign wealth fund
            business, to Dubai from London, people familiar with the matter
            said in April. Goldman Sachs and Renaissance Capital Ltd. are
            among banks bulking up their equity business in Dubai, according
            to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates and Qatar were raised to emerging-market status from frontier by index
            provider MSCI Inc. in 2013,
            encouraging more foreign investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays is advising Abu Dhabi-based Al Jaber Group in a
            potential sale of its transportation and lifting unit, people
            familiar with the matter said last month. The bank plans to
            boost hiring at its corporate banking business in Dubai, Rezwan
            Mirza, head of that business in the United Arab Emirates and
            Gulf countries, said in a May 26 interview &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nataf joined Barclays in 2008 and was most recently a
            managing director at the bank. Eldabag handled several roles at
            Goldman including as co-head of investment banking for Middle
            East and head of client coverage and head of MA in the region,
            according to the memo. He left the bank last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Lead $350 Million Buyout of Fund Holdings</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s asset-management arm is the lead investor in a transaction to
            purchase stakes in two older distressed-debt funds overseen by a former unit of Carlyle Group LP's TCW Group
            Inc., two people with knowledge of the deal said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management agreed
            to lead a syndicate that will buy stakes from investors in 2002 and 2005 funds run by Crescent Capital Group
            LP, which separated from TCW in 2011, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            information is private. The deal size would be about $350 million, including net asset value and new
            investment capital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital, the Los Angeles-based firm headed by co-founders
            Mark Attanasio and Jean-Marc Chapus, hired UBS AG to run the sales process, which would offer its investors
            a way to exit their holdings, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's asset-management arm,
            which oversees $935 billion, is deploying capital in a competitive secondary market where deal volume is
            expected to exceed $30 billion this year as buyers bid up prices to post-crisis highs, according to a July
            report from Dallas-based investment bank Cogent Partners. Goldman Sachs bid 94.8 percent of net asset value
            for stakes in the 2002 fund in August, according to memo on the Fresno County Employees' Retirement
            Association website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman at New York-based Goldman Sachs,
            declined to comment on the deal, as did Bill Mendel, a spokesman for Crescent Capital with Mendel
            Communications and Megan Stinson, a spokeswoman for UBS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fresh Capital &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several
            private-equity firms have sought to restructure older funds to gather fresh capital or secure time to sell
            investments in recent years. Chicago-based Lake Capital Partners LP, after deciding against raising another
            buyout fund more than a decade ago, was considering allowing clients to sell their stakes in its 2002 pool,
            two people briefed on the matter said in July. Diamond Castle Holdings LLC, the New York-based firm started
            by executives from Credit Suisse Group AG, and Boston-based J.W. Childs Associates LP have explored similar
            deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital is letting investors exit TCW Shared Opportunity Fund IV, a $250
            million pool nearing the end of its life. Crescent would manage the fund on Goldman's behalf while it sells
            the remaining investments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investors agreed to extend the term of the fund, originally
            scheduled to expire in December 2010, until the end of this year, according to the Fresno County memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;California's Fresno County committed $15 million to the 2002 fund, which was producing a 6.5
            percent net internal rate of return as of June 30, another memo shows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Crescent Capital
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crescent Capital raised its last distressed-focused fund almost a decade ago. TCW
            Shared Opportunity Fund V, which gathered about $525 million in 2005, has backed Banc of California Inc. and
            First PacTrust Bancorp Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The private-equity firm, which invests in corporate debt
            securities, managed about $15 billion in commitments and capital as of Dec. 31, according to its website.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which oversees $935 billion, invests in fixed income,
            money markets, public equity, commodities, hedge funds, private equity and real estate. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Fortress Hires Goldman Sachs's Rosenberg for Gaming Debt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), the
            first publicly traded hedge-fund and private-equity manager in
            the U.S., hired Adam Rosenberg from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
            lead credit investments in gaming and leisure companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rosenberg, who was global head of gaming investment banking
            at Goldman Sachs, spent 16 years at the New York-based
            investment bank, according to a statement today. Previously he
            was a lawyer at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress has been hiring from Wall Street as banks struggle
            to retain senior staff amid lower pay and heightened scrutiny
            from regulators. Earlier this year it hired Jeffrey Feig from
            Citigroup Inc. to be co-president of the liquid markets business
            with Mike Novogratz, and the firm hired former Deutsche Bank AG
            currency trader Christopher Faly for the group. Fortress also
            hired Rajeev Misra, UBS AG's former co-head of fixed income, and
            Adam Siegel, a former trader at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
            Plc. Siegel will work with Michael Nierenberg, who joined from
            Bank of America Corp. last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress's main macro hedge fund lost 2.3 percent last
            month and 5.8 percent this year, according to a regulatory
            filing this week. The firm is doing better in its credit-focused
            strategies, with the Drawbridge Special Opportunities Fund
            rising 0.6 percent in July to lift its 2014 gain through that
            month to 6.4 percent, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fortress, based in New York, rose 0.4 percent to $7.31 at
            10:53 a.m. in New York. The stock is down 60 percent since the
            company's February 2007 initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Scraps RBI Interest-Rate Increase View on Better Monsoon</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
            scrapped its forecast for the Reserve Bank of India to raise
            borrowing costs after a pickup in monsoon rains and a drop in
            oil prices tempered the inflation outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. lender, which had expected a 50-basis-point
            increase in the benchmark repurchase rate this year followed by
            a reduction of the same magnitude in the second half of 2015,
            now sees the RBI staying on hold through the end of next year,
            it said in a report. Consumer-price (INFUTOTY) gains slowed to 7.8 percent
            in August, from as high as 11.16 percent in November, the median
            estimate in a Bloomberg survey shows before data due Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Near-term risks to inflation have receded due to weaker
            oil prices and a significantly improved monsoon,' Tushar Poddar, an economist at Goldman in Mumbai, wrote in
            the report
            dated yesterday. 'While our base case is now for the RBI to
            remain on hold, the probability of a rate hike is higher than
            that of a rate cut. The biggest change under the new government
            has been a more investor-friendly mindset.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took
            office after a landslide election win in May, will spur economic
            growth, lure capital inflows and support the rupee, Goldman said
            in the report. A shortfall in India's annual rains, crucial for
            crops from sugar to rice and cotton, has narrowed to 11 percent
            from more than 40 percent in June, official data show, and Brent
            crude prices have retreated 14 percent from this year's high of
            $115.71 per barrel in June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Quickening Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman predicts Asia's third-largest economy will expand
            5.6 percent in the fiscal year through March 2015. Gross
            domestic product increased 4.7 percent in the previous period, a
            pace that was near the decade-low 4.5 percent recorded the year
            before. The U.S. lender still sees the rupee weakening to 61 per
            dollar, 62 and 63 in three, six and 12 months. The currency fell
            0.4 percent to 60.8225 as of 9:21 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
            prices from local banks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who raised borrowing costs
            three times in the past year to combat inflation, has left them
            unchanged since January. The central bank will hold the
            benchmark rate at 8 percent through the end of 2014, according
            to 16 of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Four see a reduction
            to 7.75 percent, while five estimate a 25-basis-point increase
            and one expects an advance to 8.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Modi's decisions to cut red tape and allow more foreign
            investment in industries including railways and defense have
            buoyed investor confidence, Goldman said in the report. The
            rupee has rebounded 13 percent from a record low of 68.845 per
            dollar reached in August 2013, the world's best-performing
            emerging-market currency over that period, data compiled by
            Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think the Indian rupee will continue to trade in a
            narrow range, with the RBI intervening to prevent any sharp
            appreciation,' Goldman's Poddar wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Expects Negative Return on Commodity Index in 12 Months</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
            12-month forecast for commodity returns, predicting a decline in
            precious metals, agriculture and energy. The bank kept its
            neutral recommendation on raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Standard Poor's GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will
            drop 2 percent, compared with an increase of 0.1 percent
            expected in July, analysts led by New York-based Jeffrey Currie
            said in a report today. Energy, with a 73.5 percent weighting,
            will probably fall 1 percent, while precious metals slide 15
            percent and agriculture declines 7 percent, they said.
            Industrial metals may increase 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The gauge advanced 2.9 percent this year through Sept. 9 on
            speculation the U.S. may launch a military strike on Syria in
            retaliation for what it said was use of chemical weapons.
            President Barack Obama has since asked Congress to postpone a
            vote on military action while he pursues a diplomatic solution.
            JPMorgan Chase Co. said Sept. 6 it turned overweight on
            commodities because of an improvement in manufacturing, better
            demand and more optimism over China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors will probably make more profits buying and
            rolling front-end futures, rather than purchasing one year out
            and holding to maturity, the analysts said. 'We expect this
            strong positive carry to offset these declines, leaving returns
            mostly flat over the next year. Accordingly, we are maintaining
            our neutral recommendation on commodities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 17 percent this year
            to $107.10 a barrel while gold for immediate delivery dropped 18
            percent to $1,366.88 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Libyan Crude Output Loss Offers Prompt Buy Option, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Libyan crude output losses and the
            possible escalation of unrest in Syria provide an option to buy
            front-month futures, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Protests at oil fields and ports in Libya have reduced
            supply from the country to the lowest since October 2011,
            prompting Goldman to halve its forecast for production this
            month to 500,000 barrels a day, the bank said in a report today.
            With Iraq's output forecast also revised down by 100,000 barrels
            a day, this will cause a shortage in spare capacity from the
            Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this month,
            according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The premium of front-month Brent to the second, or
            backwardation, widened to $1.90 a barrel on Sept. 3, the most
            since November 2012. This structure, allied to the lack of
            supply, gives investors with an opportunity to double their
            returns by buying prompt futures and holding on to them, said
            Jeffrey Currie, a New York-based analyst at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With currently high levels of backwardation in oil,
            investors can earn returns even when prices are expected to be
            flat, or even fall slightly, by buying deferred oil contracts
            and waiting as they approach expiry,' Currie said. 'Rolling
            the front-end over the course of one year would generate nearly
            twice the return of buying one year out and holding to
            maturity.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The risk to oil output remains greater in Libya than in
            Syria, with the loss to OPEC's spare capacity occurring at the
            same time as petroleum inventories in members of the
            Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development are set
            to fall to their lowest levels since 2004, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This shortage is driving Goldman's forecast for Brent to
            trade at $115 a barrel in the near-term. The October contract
            was at $112.31 as of 10:07 a.m. London time on the ICE Futures
            Europe exchange. Longer-term the tightness in supply will
            probably ease with the bank predicting crude to drop to $105 a
            barrel, barring any spillover of hostilities in Syria to
            neighboring countries. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Gold Seen Lower by Goldman as Fed's Taper to Spur Selling</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gold will extend a drop into 2014
            as the U.S. Federal Reserve tapers stimulus, Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. said, forecasting that a decision by the central bank to
            start reducing bond-buying next week may spur renewed selling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reduction of asset purchases may be the catalyst that
            pushes gold prices lower, analysts including Jeffrey Currie and
            Damien Courvalin wrote in a report today. Goldman's economists
            expect that policy makers will curb quantitative easing at the
            Sept. 17-18 meeting as the economy improves, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold slumped 19 percent in 2013 after rallying for 12 years
            as investors sold the metal at record pace from exchange-traded
            products on prospects for a global recovery. The Fed will pare
            the $85 billion monthly bond-buying at the meeting, according to
            a Bloomberg survey on Sept. 6, backing away from the stimulus
            program used by the central bank to revive the largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Gold prices will decline into 2014 on the back of an
            acceleration in U.S. activity and a less accommodative monetary-policy stance,' the analysts wrote. 'The
            September FOMC
            meeting, where our economists expect a tapering of QE3, could
            prove the catalyst to push gold prices lower.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold futures on the Comex, which touched a record $1,923.70
            an ounce two years ago, traded at $1,362.10 by 9:27 a.m. in New
            York. Goldman kept its three- and six-month targets at $1,300 an
            ounce, while saying that the approach of the U.S. debt ceiling
            may limit declines until the borrowing threshold is raised by
            October. The bank's 12-month target is $1,175. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lower Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA, Citigroup Inc., ABN Amro Group NV and
            Macquarie Group Ltd. are among banks predicting lower prices in
            2014 as the global economy recovers and inflation fails to
            accelerate. JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp. say
            bullion may be bottoming as the rout boosts demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors sold 683.3 metric tons of gold from ETPs this
            year, reducing holdings by more than $56 billion to 1,948.6
            tons, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The assets have
            dropped every month this year after peaking at 2,632.5 tons in
            December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold should drop to $1,200 by about the end of the year on
            sales from ETPs and a reduced likelihood of a U.S. military
            action against Syria, Societe Generale said in a report e-mailed
            yesterday. President Barack Obama said yesterday that he has
            asked Congress to delay a vote authorizing a strike. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Open Market Committee will reduce Treasury
            purchases to $35 billion a month from $45 billion, while
            maintaining mortgage-bond buying at $40 billion, according to
            the median of 34 responses in the Bloomberg survey. That pace
            was unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll, as was a projection that
            the program will end in June. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees CDS Mismatch as Fed Distorts Risk: Russia Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's credit risk is lower than
            markets are pricing in because the world's biggest energy
            exporter has strong earnings from oil sales and a low debt
            burden in its favor, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contracts, which insure against a default, are 25 basis
            points more expensive than the average of 10 developing-nation
            peers and should trade at least on par, Clemens Grafe, an
            economist at Goldman Sachs in Moscow, said yesterday. Russia's
            credit-default swaps climbed 44 basis points since May 22 to
            180, compared with a 46-basis point increase to 176 for Brazil
            and an advance of 51 to 218 for South Africa, all ranked BBB at
            Standard Poor's and Fitch Ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors probably haven't taken into account Russia's
            current account surplus, driven by energy exports, while other
            nations run deficits, Grafe said. Emerging-market credit default
            swaps climbed, indicating rising investor perceptions of risk,
            and bonds sold off after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled in May that quantitative
            easing could be pared
            amid signs of an improving U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Russia is obviously the one that has the least problems
            on the external front,' Grafe said by phone yesterday. 'The
            market has aligned Russia with the wrong part of the peer group.
            Russia certainly should outperform its peers in this
            environment.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Oil Boost &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia ran a current account surplus equivalent to 3
            percent of gross domestic product at the end of the first
            quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Brazil had a 3 percent
            deficit in the period, while South Africa ran a 5.8 percent
            shortfall. Russia has $510.8 billion of gold and foreign-currency reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Crude jumped to $116.61 per barrel in London on Aug. 28,
            the highest since 2008, on concern a U.S. strike on Syria would
            lead to supply disruptions in the Middle East. The oil and
            natural gas industries contribute about 50 percent of Russia's
            government revenue. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is due to
            meet counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva today to discuss a
            Russian initiative to place Syria's chemical weapons arsenal
            under international control. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Historically Russia's credit risk traded in line with the
            peer group average,' Grafe said. 'It has the lowest external
            financial requirements out of all emerging markets with the
            exception probably of China.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Auction Sell-out &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia is 'robust and protected' given only 4 percent of
            its foreign debt is due in the 'short-term' and the total is
            equivalent to 31 percent of GDP, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote
            in a report dated June 13. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry sold out two auctions of ruble bonds
            yesterday as the possibility of U.S. military action subsided,
            boosting investor appetite for riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Sept. 9, Russia sold the most foreign debt this year
            among emerging-market nations with a $7 billion placement in
            dollars and euros. Investor demand was more than double the
            amount offered, Andrey Solovyev, the head of debt capital
            markets at VTB Capital, which arranged the sale with five other
            banks, said Sept. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia's CDS need to rise a further 15 basis points to be a
            tempting investment because of the country's exposure to oil-price movements, Konstantin Artemov, who
            manages $500 million of
            fixed-income funds at Raiffeisen Capital in Moscow, said by
            phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on Russia's 2042 dollar notes dropped 11 basis
            points today to 5.737 percent by 11:37 a.m. in Moscow. The extra
            yield investors demand to hold Russia's dollar debt rather than
            Treasuries fell one basis point to 237, compared with a gain of
            one basis point to 237 for Brazil, according to JPMorgan
            indexes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Key Categories &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's analysts compared Russia against countries rated
            BBB on 11 macroeconomic, fiscal and structural criteria, which
            Fitch uses in its sovereign credit rating model. Russia ranked
            in the middle of the peer group based on all variables, and
            above average for key categories the market is focusing on,
            including external and fiscal balances, Grafe said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This mispricing will disappear in the next few months,'
            he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Reiterates Bullish Call on Stocks, Citing Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stocks will continue to rally as
            the bull market in equities moves into a new phase driven by
            earnings growth rather than expanding valuations, according to
            strategists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Equities will produce more moderate returns with lower
            volatility in the second phase of the bull market, according to
            Peter Oppenheimer, Goldman's chief global equity strategist, who
            reiterated his bullish stance on stocks. Oppenheimer said in a
            March 2012 report that the prospects for returns from equities
            versus bonds 'are as good as they have been in a generation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Accommodative monetary policies from central banks have
            helped extend the bull market in U.S. stocks into a fifth year.
            The Standard Poor's 500 Index has rallied 150 percent since
            March 2009, driven by three rounds of bond purchases by the
            Federal Reserve and better-than-forecast earnings by companies.
            The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has surged 96 percent in the same
            period, while the MSCI World Index has climbed 123 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Eighteen months on, we continue to believe the case for
            equities remains strong, albeit with returns likely to be more
            muted in the months ahead,' London-based Oppenheimer wrote in a
            report dated yesterday. 'The driver from here is likely to be
            earnings growth rather than valuation expansion from current
            levels, consistent with the growth phase of the equity cycle.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China's Commodity Demand Seen by Goldman Rising Rest of Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Commodity demand in China, the
            world's largest user of iron ore, copper and tin, will rebound
            through the end of the year as infrastructure projects gather
            pace and users restock, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The key demand driver is infrastructure and fixed-asset
            investment, analyst Julian Zhu told reporters at a briefing in
            Singapore today. Steel prices in the world's largest producer
            were seen higher through the end of December, Zhu said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's assessment adds to signs that a slowdown in the
            second-largest economy may be ending, lifting the outlook for
            commodities from iron ore to base metals. While Premier Li
            Keqiang said yesterday that the foundations of a recovery aren't
            solid, policy makers have signaled that they will defend a 7.5
            percent expansion goal for 2013. Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            today raised its growth forecast for China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'From now till the end of this year, we anticipate China
            demand for commodities to continue to recover,' Zhu said. 'The
            current commodities inventory in China is still quite low and
            with the further demand rebound, we should see the ongoing
            restocking to continue as well.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Commodities as tracked by the Standard Poor's GSCI Index
            of 24 raw materials are little changed this year, after
            advancing in July and August. Iron ore with 62 percent content
            delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin rose 0.1 percent to
            $135.20 a ton today, up from this year's low of $110.40 in May,
            according to figures from The Steel Index Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Higher Forecast &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Data this month showed industrial production beat estimates
            and manufacturing resumed growth, signaling that the economy is
            strengthening after a two-quarter slowdown. Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch said China will grow 7.7 percent in 2013, up from
            7.6 percent previously forecast, according to a report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People are getting more positive, but they're not super
            bullish, not yet,' said Zhu 'You're going to see further
            upside. If you look at the early indicators in September, it
            seems like the overall economic activity is picking up.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's GDP growth slowed to 7.5 percent in the second
            quarter from a year earlier, extending the longest streak of
            sub-8 percent expansion in at least two decades. Li signaled in
            July he won't tolerate a slowdown beyond 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government used measures from extra spending on
            railways to tax cuts to respond to the slowdown. The State
            Council is targeting 690 billion yuan ($113 billion) of fixed-asset investment in the railway industry this
            year, the Beijing
            News reported in July. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steel reinforcement-bar futures ended at 3,713 yuan a
            metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange today, after
            advancing in August for a third month, the best run of gains
            since January 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Market Gains Will Abide as Rates Rise in Goldman's View</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;'None of the U.S. expansions of
            the past 40 years died in bed of old age,' the late
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor
            Rudiger Dornbusch observed in 1997. 'Every one was murdered by
            the Federal Reserve.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As investors brace for interest-rate increases by the Fed
            and the Bank of England, the message from Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. is that the economic recovery and animal spirits of
            financial markets will abide in most major economies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank, which made $1.63 billion from its equities
            division in the second quarter, bases its call on its analysis
            of 33 interest-rate tightening cycles since the mid-1980s in
            economies including the U.S., U.K. Germany and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our bottom line is that a shift to higher yields need not
            be a roadblock to ongoing economic and market progress,' Noah Weisberger, a New York-based economist, said
            in a report
            published Sept. 10. 'Markets may well be able to adjust to a
            new rate regime without much loss of momentum.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The analysis shows policy rates rise about 150 basis points
            in a typical cycle, which lasts about 12 months. There's another
            four years or so before a subsequent recession. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Annualized economic growth averages almost 4 percent in the
            four quarters before the tightening and loses only about 20
            basis points during the cycle before slowing to just over 2
            percent in the subsequent year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Despite current concerns, historically, rate cycles seem
            to leave economic growth largely intact at the outset, and, over
            the longer term, tend to slow economic growth without disrupting
            it,' according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Financial Markets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As for financial markets, 10-year yields move an average 40
            basis points in the year leading up to the first rate increase
            and equity markets grow an average 9 percent into the onset. In
            the full year after the hikes begin, stocks post 12 percent
            returns on average. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given sluggish growth and labor-market slack in the U.S.
            and Europe, central banks will be careful not to douse the
            expansion when they do start raising, Weisberger said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Despite heightened worries about the market and economic
            implications of the removal of monetary accommodation, our read
            of the historical evidence is that such concerns are likely
            misplaced and overdone, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ukraine Creditors Could See 50% Loss in a Default, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ukraine's deteriorating economic
            outlook is increasing the likelihood of a default that could
            saddle bondholders with losses of about 50 percent, according to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A six-month conflict with pro-Russian rebels has spurred
            capital outflows and disrupted economic output to the point
            where it brings into question Ukraine's ability to continue
            paying its debt, Goldman analysts including Clemens Grafe wrote
            in an e-mailed report. Past restructurings indicate bondholders
            could lose half their principal, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Sept. 5 truce is holding amid efforts to end a war the
            United Nations estimates has claimed at least 3,000 lives. The
            fighting in Ukraine's Donetsk and Lugansk regions has destroyed
            productive capacity, displaced a large share of the country's
            population and disrupted exports, prompting Goldman to raise
            economic contraction estimates to 8 percent from 3 percent in
            March and increase this year's debt-to-GDP forecast to 70
            percent from 55 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our current forecasts and the persisting uncertainty
            surrounding the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine now raise
            the question of whether the country can return to a sustainable
            debt path without a restructuring,' the Goldman analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on Ukraine's $2.6 billion of bonds due 2017 jumped
            0.38 percentage points today to 12.84 percent, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. Bond trading indicate investors are
            pricing in about a 15 percent chance of a restructuring within
            the next year and 35 percent chance in the next five years, the
            analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>ViroPharma Said to Hire Goldman Amid Sanofi Interest</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM), a producer of
            drugs that treat rare diseases, has attracted interest from
            suitors including European drugmakers Sanofi (SAN) and Shire Plc (SHP), said
            people with knowledge of the process. ViroPharma's shares
            surged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ViroPharma began working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on a
            possible auction after fielding an unsolicited approach, said
            the people, who asked not to be named because talks are private.
            Goldman Sachs has actively sought other suitors for the Exton,
            Pennsylvania-based drugmaker since then, said one person.
            ViroPharma's market value was about $2 billion before
            Bloomberg's report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
            have pursued acquisitions this year as they seek new drugs to
            replace products whose patents are expiring. After Amgen Inc.'s
            agreement to buy Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) for $10.4 billion in
            August, the value of deals in the two sectors has risen 14
            percent from a year earlier to more than $70 billion, according
            to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ViroPharma shares gained 28 percent to $39.13 at the close
            in New York, the biggest single-day increase since August 2005.
            Representatives at Sanofi, ViroPharma, Shire and Goldman Sachs
            declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Lifts Soybean Price Outlook as USDA Downgrades U.S. Crop</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
            outlook for U.S. soybean prices in the next three and six months
            after a government report yesterday showed U.S. production will
            be reduced due to dry weather. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soybeans may be $12.50 a bushel in three months and $11.50
            in six months, below current price levels while above the bank's
            previous outlook of $10.50 a bushel, Goldman analysts including
            Damien Courvalin wrote in an e-mailed report today. The U.S.
            Department of Agriculture lowered its forecast for the U.S.
            harvest to 3.149 billion bushels yesterday, its second cut in as
            many months and 3.3 percent less than expected in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Uncertainty over the size of the U.S. corn and especially
            soybean crops remain unusually high for this time of year given
            the volatility and extremes in planting and growing weather
            across the Midwest,' Courvalin wrote. The USDA may lower its
            outlook for U.S. yields again in its October report, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soybeans for November delivery rallied 2.8 percent
            yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, before falling as much
            as 0.7 percent today to $13.8675 a bushel. The most-active
            contract has jumped 20 percent since reaching a 19-month low in
            August as heat and dry weather intensified in U.S. growing
            areas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Areas of the Midwest, including top growers Iowa and
            Illinois, had as little as 5 percent of the normal amount of
            rain in the last 30 days, according to the National Weather
            Service. Crop development was already delayed by wet, cool
            weather earlier this year, leaving yields vulnerable to heat and
            dry weather in August, a time when plants are developing pods
            and maturing before the harvest, USDA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Production &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soybean prices may still be pressured by ample world
            supplies, Courvalin said. Global production may be 281.66
            million metric tons, less than expected in August while still
            the biggest crop on record, the USDA estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we see upside risk to current prices given downside
            risks to U.S. production, we ultimately believe that lower U.S.
            exports and another large increase in South American soybean
            acreage and production will leave U.S. inventories above last
            year's level and prices below the current forward curve,'
            Courvalin said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corn prices may be $4.25 a bushel in the next three, six
            and 12 months, Courvalin said. The bank left its wheat forecast
            unchanged at $6.50 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Scores Coup With Lead Position on Twitter IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), on pace to be the top adviser on U.S. initial public offerings for
            the first time since 2009, scored a coup by landing the lead role on Twitter Inc.'s sale. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twitter,
            which announced yesterday that it filed for an IPO, gave Goldman Sachs the job of running the sale, a person
            with knowledge of the matter said. JPMorgan Chase Co. and Morgan Stanley (MS) will also be bankers for the
            IPO, said another person, who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Deutsche Bank AG
            also has a part, another person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lost out to rival Morgan Stanley on
            similar roles in the highest-profile technology IPOs in recent years, including Facebook Inc. (FB)'s $16
            billion sale last year and offerings by Groupon Inc. and Zynga Inc. the year before. San Francisco-based
            Twitter may have opted for Goldman Sachs after the other offerings drew criticism and complaints from
            shareholders, according to Michael Holland of Holland Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The Facebook experience was
            one that was so egregious that Twitter did a fairly predictable thing,' said Holland, who oversees more than
            $4 billion as chairman of the New York-based money manager. 'When the biggest and best have needed IPO
            services, Goldman is always a finalist.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Risk of Gold Below $1,000 on U.S. Economy</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Gold is poised to extend declines
            as the U.S. Federal Reserve withdraws stimulus and economic data
            improve, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which says that
            there's a risk that bullion may drop below $1,000 an ounce.
            Futures retreated in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While debt-ceiling discussions in the U.S. and the Syrian
            crisis may support bullion in the near term, gold will resume
            its decline into next year, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
            research, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television today.
            The bank's target for 2014 is $1,050, and the commodity may
            overshoot to the downside, Currie said in Singapore. Gold
            futures haven't traded below $1,000 since October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bullion has dropped 22 percent this year as some investors
            lost faith in the metal as a store of value, the U.S. economy
            improved and stocks and the dollar rallied. The Fed will pare
            its $85 billion a month bond-buying program next week, according
            to a Bloomberg survey. Earlier this year, Currie issued a sell
            recommendation on bullion on April 10, before gold plunged 13
            percent in a two-session slump that ended April 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While we agree with the mid-cycle price somewhere around
            $1,200, we believe that at least near term it can overshoot to
            the downside, which is why we have $1,050' as a target, Currie
            said. 'It clearly could trade below $1,000.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Record Price &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold for December delivery fell as much as 2 percent to
            $1,304.60 on the Comex, the lowest since Aug. 9, and traded at
            $1,314.40 at 11:52 a.m. in New York. Most-active futures reached
            a record $1,923.70 in September 2011. Goldman's three- and six-month targets are $1,300, according to a
            report on Sept. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global stocks tracked by the MSCI All-Country World Index
            rallied 12 percent this year and the Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index
            climbed 3.9 percent. The Fed began buying $40 billion of
            mortgage-backed securities per month in September of last year
            and then supplemented that with $45 billion of Treasury
            securities in December to bolster the recovery. Fed Chairman Ben
            S. Bernanke suggested on June 19 that the program might be wound
            up by the middle of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'For next year, a move to $1,000 is on the cards,' said
            Dominic Schnider, head of commodities research at UBS AG's
            wealth-management unit in Singapore. 'Once a timetable of
            tapering is known, then you probably will see a fresh selling
            wave of the exchange-traded fund side.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most of the Fed's expected decision next week to start
            tapering has been priced in, and Goldman expects an initial
            reduction of $10 billion a month in asset purchases, said
            Currie. A stronger dollar would diminish gold demand, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ETP Sales &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investors have sold bullion at a record pace from exchange-traded products this year. Holdings in
            ETPs have contracted
            684.1 metric tons to 1,947.8 tons after shrinking every month in
            2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG raised the possibility of gold
            trading below $1,000 in May as Ric Deverell, head of commodities
            research at the bank, said then that bullion was going to get
            crushed as inflation risks remained muted. That forecast was for
            bullion in five years' time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The real key in gold is to see the evidence of the
            improving economic data in the U.S.,' said Currie, who is based
            in New York. Weakening emerging-market currencies, especially
            the South African rand, will also help to reduce the cost of
            production in dollars, he said &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Institute for Supply Management's factory index showed
            U.S. manufacturing expanded in August at the fastest pace since
            June 2011. The group's gauge of service industries, which cover
            almost 90 percent of the economy, posted the highest reading
            since December 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Disaster Insurance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gold has fallen this year because investors see less need
            for disaster insurance, Bernanke said in July. One reason that
            prices are lower is that people are less concerned about extreme
            outcomes, particularly negative, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. federal government needs to increase its debt
            limit later this year, and Goldman expects that the ceiling will
            be raised by the end of next month, according to the Sept. 11
            report. On Syria, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with
            Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov this week to seek to get
            Syria to give up its chemical weapons. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
            insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            and George Soros, filed to raise $287.5 million in an initial
            public offering as investors pour capital into companies that
            guaranty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase Co. and Barclays Plc are
            managing the offering, Bermuda-based Essent said today in a
            regulatory filing. The offering size is a placeholder amount used
            to calculate registration fees and may change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgages insurers MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) and Radian Group
            Inc., which are recovering from years of losses, have sold stock
            and notes to investors including hedge fund manager John Paulson
            who has been betting on the recovery of the U.S. housing market.
            The guarantors cover losses when homeowners default and
            foreclosures fail to recoup costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering may be used for 'capital
            contributions to support the growth of our insurance
            subsidiaries,' Essent said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Topping Minimum Capital Ratio in Severe Recession</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            could survive a global market shock that would send stocks down
            almost 40 percent and produce $20 billion in trading losses for
            the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at
            least 8.9 percent during the shock, above the 5 percent minimum,
            the New York-based firm said in a disclosure of its company-run
            stress test. The test included the assumption of a
            'reputational event' specific to Goldman Sachs that would
            reduce its revenue over the nine-quarter length of the exam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks must conduct so-called mid-cycle
            stress tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of
            the results. Goldman Sach's performance in its own test topped
            that in the Federal Reserve's version in March, in which it had
            a minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5.8 percent. The Fed's test had
            different assumptions and covered a different time period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs projected it would have a $6.2 billion net
            loss over the nine quarters from April 2013 to June 2015 in a
            'severely adverse scenario.' The bank would have $15.5 billion
            of pre-provision net revenue in the period, overwhelmed by $20
            billion in trading and counterparty losses, $1.1 billion in
            other losses and a $600 million provision for loan losses. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Jen Not Buying Expansion Goldman-Morgan Stanley Pitching</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Even with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sounding the all-clear, Stephen Jen is
            inclined to stay in the bunker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The co-founder of London-based hedge fund SLJ Macro
            Partners LLC and former chief currency strategist at Morgan Stanley is pushing back against research by
            economists at his one-time employer and Goldman Sachs that the U.S. and global economic expansions have long
            to run. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I don't find their argument persuasive at all,' Jen wrote in a Sept. 9 note to
            clients. 'I see the probability of recessions being higher, not lower.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His reasoning is
            that the U.S. and other developed countries still have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis and
            recession that accelerated with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., six years ago yesterday.
            Government debt, for example, has ballooned, leaving economies less secure than in previous expansions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The weak recovery is another reason for Jen to worry. He says it leaves economies prone to small
            shocks that could tip them into another contraction. The euro area stalled in the second quarter, while a
            harsh winter was enough for the U.S. to shrink in the first -- leaving the return to historically normal
            interest rates an unpredictable force. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Easy Money &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley
            said in a Sept. 2 report that a prolonged period of deleveraging in the U.S., alongside global growth, could
            mean the current five-year-old expansion lasts to 2020. It last week extended its analysis to the world
            economy, saying it could grow another five years amid easy money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Making a similar
            argument, Kris Dawsey of Goldman Sachs said in a report last month that most economic indicators and asset
            markets suggest the U.S. expansion is not at a late stage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jen says the financial crisis
            changed how economies work, limiting the value of comparisons with past business cycles. He notes Japan had
            six recessions and contracted 37 percent of the quarters since its own asset bubbles burst in 1989-1990.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There are so many features of the macro economy that have been strange and different
            since the global financial crisis of 2008,' said Jen. 'I'm not sure one can be too confident about drawing
            lessons from the pre-crisis period.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Goldman Trader Swaps Financial Services for Speedy Food Delivery</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Rahul Parekh became used to long hours and late nights at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in London, where
            he was executive director of equity-derivatives trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was the food that took its
            toll. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I remember when I was at Goldman Sachs, working late in the evening and nothing
            was open nearby,' he said in an interview. 'You order online from one of the delivery businesses and can end
            up waiting 1-1/2 hours for a greasy takeaway that doesn't feel healthy in any way.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It
            may have been more a microwave moment than a light-bulb idea but Parekh decided he could do better. He quit
            Goldman earlier this year and co-founded EatFirst, a food-delivery service that cooks its own fresh meals
            and promises to get them to your office in the City of London within 15 minutes of an order being placed.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EatFirst follows an initial public offering in Just Eat Plc, an online takeaway service
            whose shares began trading in April. Just Eat was started in Denmark in 2001 and expanded into the U.K. in
            2006. Just Eat Plc has a market value of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.6 billion). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just Eat
            connects customers with restaurants for takeaway meals. Unlike EatFirst, it doesn't make or deliver the
            food. Other companies in the market include Deliveroo, which supplies foods from restaurants and charges for
            delivery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parekh's partners are Humberto Ayres Pereira, who was at McKinsey Co. and
            founded the Skin online cosmetics business in his native Portugal; and Torben Schulz, an entrepreneur who
            plans to start an EatFirst in Berlin, where he is based. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EatFirst is backed by
            Berlin-based Rocket Internet AG, which invests in companies related to the Internet industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Two Dishes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company currently offers a choice of two dishes, one of them
            vegetarian. They both change daily and are prepared in a kitchen in Farringdon, near the City of London.
            Recent options include chorizo and chicken jambalaya; Thai massaman curry; and goat cheese ratatouille. Each
            costs 7 pounds ($11.32). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The executive chef is Jane Tran, who previously worked at Bar
            Boulud. A third option will be added in coming months. Customers may pay by debit or credit card or via an
            app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parekh, 28, was born in Manchester, England, to a family that was originally from
            Gujarat, in India. His parents were born in Kenya. EatFirst is initially delivering in part of the City of
            London financial district. It's a crowded market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'At Goldman, I used to cycle between
            Itsu on a Monday, and a Pret on a Tuesday, and a Leon on a Wednesday and a Pod on a Thursday and it just
            gets so boring after a couple of weeks,' he said. 'That's what we really wanted to change with EatFirst so
            people can have a varied diet and don't have to look elsewhere.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Natalie Berg, global
            research director at Planet Retail Ltd. in London, said that while the trend toward healthy convenience food
            isn't new, technology is changing things. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Working Lunch &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Food
            delivery has been limited to pizza and other fast food without high-quality options,' she said in a
            telephone interview. 'But technology is changing this and there's an opportunity to tap into a very
            lucrative working-lunch market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''What is especially interesting with EatFirst is that
            it's based on simplicity -- just a couple of dishes -- which helps them to keep costs down and reinforces
            the ethos of high-quality, freshly prepared food.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parekh declined to disclose financial
            details or profit targets. He said the company plans to expand aggressively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In a place
            like London, which is so vast and so densely populated, the sky's the limit,' he said. 'Even the City, which
            is a tiny area, there's almost 400,000 people during the day, so there's no reason we can't be pushing
            towards thousands a day and be the biggest food-delivery company in London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Food Has
            Lagged &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;''For the first year, I'd imagine within London we can get over 1,000 meals a
            day and that would be serving the City and central London and also expanding to Canary Wharf. We have a
            pretty aggressive expansion plan. We are working on a number of new kitchen locations and expanding our
            delivery network &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''I see this as the future for food delivery. As other retail products
            move online, food has really lagged. Our expansion plan is realistic given the future that we expect for the
            food industry and the online-delivery landscape.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Britons ordering food online
            currently do so through a restaurant's own website such as Pizza Hut, according to Helena Childe, senior
            food service analyst at Mintel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Third-party sites such as Just Eat are increasing in
            popularity, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Most online restaurant habits (from online ordering to mobile
            payments) are most common among Londoners and the tech-savvy youth market (under-35s),' Childe said in a
            Mintel report, 'Eating Out: The Decision-Making Process,' earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Small Cog
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;EatFirst leases its kitchens and delivery bikes, seeking to keep down costs while it
            expands. Fair enough but was it wise to quit Goldman to pursue such a venture? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I had a
            fantastic experience at Goldman but everything we do now has a huge impact on the future of the business,'
            he said. 'It's different to working in an organization like Goldman Sachs, where you can feel like a small
            cog in a massive machine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;''This is a totally different thrill: There's new things every
            day to do. I've been in the kitchen, cleaning dishes with the chefs. I've been handing out flyers with the
            marketing team. I've been involved in fund-raising meetings. There's so much to do and it's an all-round
            business experience.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Information: https://www.eatfirst.co.uk/; the app is here:

        <headline>AIG Hires Goldman's May to Boost Image After U.S. Repaid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG),
            the company that repaid a $182.3 billion U.S. bailout last year,
            hired David May from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help revive the
            insurer's brand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;May, 54, was named to the newly created post of chief
            marketing officer and reports to Christina Pretto, senior vice
            president of corporate communications, according to a note she
            sent to colleagues. May's team at AIG includes Mark Clowes, who
            oversees corporate advertising, and Danny Glantz, who handles
            sponsorships, Pretto wrote in the memo, which was obtained by
            Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AIG restored the use of its name in U.S. television ads in
            2011 and struck a deal last year to sponsor six New Zealand
            rugby teams including the All Blacks. The branding revival was a
            reversal for the New York-based insurer, which focused on the
            identities of subsidiaries after then-Chief Executive Officer
            Edward Liddy dismissed the AIG name in 2009 as 'wounded and
            disgraced' by the bailout a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With the financial crisis well behind us, our businesses
            seek to employ best practices and the power of our global scale
            as they leverage the AIG brand,' Pretto wrote. The effort will
            involve 'marketing activities aimed at growing sales, expanding
            distribution channels, and deepening the trust our clients hold
            in us.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robert Benmosche, who took over as CEO in 2009, finished
            repaying the rescue in 2012 after selling units to help raise
            funds. This year AIG restored a dividend, the company's first
            since 2008 when the insurer was hobbled by losses on bets tied
            to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Gupta, Siewert &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;May worked for 17 years at New York-based Goldman Sachs in
            posts including director of global brand marketing, according to
            the memo. He has an MBA from Harvard University and a bachelor's
            degree from Princeton University, according to AIG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Insurers including Allstate Corp., the largest publicly
            traded provider of U.S. auto coverage, have been recruiting
            marketing executives from outside the industry. Northbrook,
            Illinois-based Allstate last year filled the chief marketing
            officer post with Sanjay Gupta, who had led rebranding at Ally
            Financial Inc.'s bank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has also worked to burnish its brand after
            fending off accusations that the bank's actions contributed to
            the financial crisis. The company last year hired former U.S.
            Treasury Department aide and presidential spokesman Jake Siewert
            as global head of corporate communications. David Wells, a
            spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn't immediately return a message
            seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AIG climbed 0.6 percent to $50.01 at 1:20 p.m. in New York.
            The insurer has rallied 42 percent this year, beating the 31
            percent advance at Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Says Investors See Market Gains as Merkel Stays in Power</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Investors expect German Chancellor
            Angela Merkel to retain power in an election and they will
            probably move money to Europe as the economy recovers, Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Joh. Berenberg Gossler Co. KG said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's a clear expectation that Merkel will be involved
            in the government in one form or another,' Philip Holzer,
            deputy head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, told reporters in
            Frankfurt today. 'Merkel's performance in the crisis was
            received very positively internationally. The Americans are
            increasingly constructive on Europe and the periphery.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merkel's Christian Democrats, who lead Germany's largest
            opposition party in polls ahead of the election this weekend,
            have made fiscal austerity a condition of rescues of indebted
            states amid efforts to preserve the euro. The European Central
            Bank has also shored up confidence in the euro area by pledging
            to buy sovereign bonds if states sign up to conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There was a certain standstill before the election,'
            Hendrik Riehmer, managing partner of Hamburg-based Berenberg,
            Germany's oldest private bank, said at the joint briefing. 'The
            expectation is that the European process will improve,
            especially with regard to the relationship between France and
            Germany.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The prospect of economic growth in Europe next year will
            draw capital from North America, Riehmer said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Market-Shock Test, ECB Change, Lloyds: Compliance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
            could survive a global market shock that would send stocks down
            almost 40 percent and produce $20 billion in trading losses for
            the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would maintain a Tier 1 common ratio of at
            least 8.9 percent during the shock, above the 5 percent minimum,
            the New York-based firm said in a disclosure of its company-run
            stress test. The test included the assumption of a
            'reputational event' specific to Goldman Sachs that would
            reduce its revenue over the nine-quarter length of the exam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and
            Bank of America Corp., must conduct so-called mid-cycle stress
            tests using their own scenarios and disclose a summary of the
            results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sach's performance in its own test topped that in
            the Federal Reserve's version in March, in which it had a
            minimum Tier 1 common ratio of 5.8 percent. The Fed's test had
            different assumptions and covered a different time period. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The firm projected it would have a $6.2 billion net loss
            over the nine quarters from April 2013 to June 2015 in a
            'severely adverse scenario.' It would have $15.5 billion of
            pre-provision net revenue in the period, overwhelmed by $20
            billion in trading and counterparty losses, $1.1 billion in
            other losses and a $600 million provision for loan losses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. bank by
            assets, could incur $21.2 billion of losses over nine quarters
            through mid-2015 and stay above minimum regulatory capital
            levels in a severe financial downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bank's Tier 1 common capital ratio would fall to as low
            as 9.1 percent under a severely adverse scenario, above the 5
            percent minimum set by U.S. regulators, the New York-based
            company said yesterday in a presentation on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup's figures assume $43.1 billion in pre-provision
            net revenue and an equal amount of loan losses in the nine
            quarters from the end of March 2013 through June 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, Bank of America saw Tier 1 capital ratio under
            its stress test at June 30, 2015, at 10.6 percent, according to
            a statement posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bundesbank Says ECB Bank Oversight May Need Primary-Law Change &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;European Union lawmakers will probably have to amend the
            rules governing the European Central Bank as it embarks on the
            complex task of regulating banks, according to the Bundesbank. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sabine Lautenschlaeger, vice president of the German
            central bank, said in Frankfurt yesterday that a 'primary law
            change' may be needed to simplify the governance structure and
            'separate monetary policy more clearly from banking
            supervision.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ECB is set to oversee banks, starting next year, as
            part of an effort to create a banking union that would break the
            link between lenders and states, which spawned the sovereign
            debt crisis. Critics say the move may create a conflict of
            interest at the central bank as policy makers are charged with
            guaranteeing the stability of Europe's financial sector while
            fighting inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bundesbank vice president said her concerns don't mean
            she favors delaying plans for more concerted controls of
            European lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Kenyan Bourse Authority Completes Draft Rules for Futures Trade &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Draft regulations, aimed at creating a fair and efficient
            futures exchange, are open for public comment until Oct. 17, the
            Capital Markets Authority, the regulator for Kenya's Bourse,
            said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The development of the two draft regulations bring to
            completion the requisite regulatory framework for the
            establishment of a futures market in Kenya,' the authority said
            in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Plans to set-up a futures market in Kenya have been delayed
            since at least 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.K. to Sell $5.3 Billion Lloyds Stake, Five Years After Bailout &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. government plans to sell a 3.3 billion-pound ($5.3
            billion) stake in Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), its first disposal
            since bailing out the lender in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which oversees the
            government's holding in the bank, is selling 4.28 billion shares
            to money managers, the London-based body said in a statement
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, constrained by
            the biggest austerity program since World War II, could use the
            proceeds to fund tax cuts or more spending before the next
            general election, due in 2015. He has said Royal Bank of
            Scotland Group Plc, which received a 45.5 billion-pound bailout,
            is still burdened by too many poor assets to be sold. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The transaction will reduce the Treasury's stake in Lloyds
            to 32.7 percent from 38.7 percent. JPMorgan Chase Co., Bank of
            America Corp. and UBS AG are managing the offering, according to
            a statement from UKFI. The government still owns 81 percent of
            Edinburgh-based RBS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Lloyds sale is the government's biggest since the
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;HSBC Joins Morgan Stanley in Plan to Screen for Money Laundering &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Morgan Stanley (MS) are working with
            outside firms to develop a shared client-screening service amid
            a crackdown by regulators on money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Genpact Ltd. (G) and Markit Group Ltd. are creating the
            service, which will help banks satisfy so-called know-your-client requirements, Hamilton, Bermuda-based
            Genpact said
            yesterday in a statement. The service will allow banks to start
            new trading relationships faster and cut costs by sharing
            expenses, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. fined London-based HSBC $1.9 billion last year
            over claims the lender gave terrorists and drug cartels access
            to the U.S. financial system. Europe's biggest bank was accused
            of failing to monitor more than $670 billion in wire transfers
            and more than $9.4 billion in purchases of U.S. currency from
            HSBC Mexico, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HSBC accepted responsibility at the time and said it's 'a
            fundamentally different organization from the one that made
            those mistakes.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based Morgan Stanley, owner of the world's largest
            brokerage, hasn't faced fines over money laundering since the
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators have ordered U.S. banks including Citigroup Inc.
            and JPMorgan Chase Co. to tighten their controls. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Courts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ex-JPMorgan Employees Indicted Over $6.2 Billion Derivative Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Two former JPMorgan Chase Co. traders were indicted for
            engaging in a securities fraud to hide trading losses that
            eventually surpassed $6.2 billion on wrong-way derivatives bets
            last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Javier Martin-Artajo, who oversaw trading strategy for the
            synthetic portfolio at the bank's chief investment office in
            London, and Julien Grout, a trader who worked for him, were
            named in a federal indictment, which was unsealed yesterday in
            federal court in Manhattan. The U.S. announced preliminary
            charges against the men in August. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both were charged in yesterday's indictment with five
            criminal counts, including securities fraud, conspiracy, filing
            false books and records, wire fraud and making false filings
            with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The pair,
            along with unnamed co-conspirators, are accused of engaging in a
            scheme to manipulate and inflate the value of position markings
            in the synthetic credit portfolio, or SCP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Martin-Artajo and Grout were named in criminal complaints
            filed by prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney
            Preet Bharara on Aug. 14 that accused them of four separate
            counts of conspiracy, falsifying books and records, wire fraud,
            and false filings with the SEC. Yesterday's indictment, which
            formalized those counts, added the securities fraud charge,
            which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has agreed to pay at least $750 million to resolve
            U.S. and U.K. regulatory probes of its record trading loss,
            people with knowledge of the negotiations said. The bank is
            seeking to settle as many inquiries as possible before the third
            quarter ends Sept. 30, the people said, asking not to be
            identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ed Little, a lawyer for Grout, and Meeta Vadher, a
            spokeswoman for Martin-Artajo's lawyers, didn't immediately
            return e-mails yesterday after regular business hours seeking
            comment on the indictment. Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New
            York-based JPMorgan, declined to comment on the charges against
            the two men. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Martin-Artajo, 13-cr-00707, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
            SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Martin-Artajo,
            13-cv-05677, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Falcone's SEC Securities Ban Settlement Gets Judge's Approval &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Billionaire hedge-fund manager Philip Falcone's $18 million
            settlement with U.S. regulators that includes a five-year ban
            from the securities industry and an admission of wrongdoing was
            accepted by a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Falcone, who became a billionaire by
            betting against the U.S. housing market in 2006, of improperly
            borrowing money from his fund to pay his personal taxes and said
            he gave preferential treatment to some of his investors in
            returning their money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The bar from the securities industry will allow Falcone to
            liquidate his hedge funds under SEC supervision. He and his firm
            will pay an $18 million fine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eric Goldstein, a lawyer representing Harbinger Capital,
            didn't immediately return phone or e-mail messages yesterday
            after regular business hours seeking comment on the settlement's
            approval. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Philip A. Falcone, 12-cv-05027, U.S.
            District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Repsol, Cepsa Lose Bid for Reduction in EU Bitumen-Cartel Fines &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol SA and Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA lost European
            Union court appeals against fines levied for fixing prices of
            bitumen in Spain, while Nynas AB and Galp Energia SGPS SA had
            their penalties cut. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU General Court yesterday rejected appeals by Repsol
            and Cepsa of the six-year-old fines. The Luxembourg-based EU
            court trimmed the fines for Galp and a Spanish unit to 8.3
            million euros ($11.1 million) from 8.6 million euros and reduced
            a penalty for Nynas to 10.4 million euros from 10.6 million
            euros. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Repsol, which previously was called Repsol YPF SA, was
            fined 80.5 million euros. Madrid-based Cepsa was fined 83.8
            million euros. BP Plc, Europe's second-largest oil company, got
            immunity from any fines for being the first to come forward with
            information about the cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bitumen is used primarily for surfacing roads and
            waterproofing. More than 10,000 European companies make or lay
            asphalt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Galp is certain that a complete annulment of the decision
            is justified,' the Lisbon, Portugal-based company said in a
            statement on the securities regulator's website. The company
            said it will study the ruling before deciding whether to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kristian Rix, a spokesman for Repsol, said the company
            didn't immediately have any comment, when contacted by phone. No
            one in the press departments of Nynas or Cepsa was immediately
            available for comment when contacted by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission, said it
            welcomed the court ruling 'as it confirms all the substantial
            findings' of the authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-462/07, T-482/07, T-495/07, T-496/07,
            T-497/07. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;RBS Said to Settle Highland Suits Over $100 Million CDO Losses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc settled lawsuits with
            Highland Capital Management LP over a failed debt deal that led
            to accusations of fraud and dishonesty, and losses of as much as
            $100 million, a person familiar with the cases said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The settlement ends a four-year legal battle with lawsuits
            in London and Texas between RBS and Dallas-based Highland. The
            terms are confidential, according to the person, who asked not
            to be identified because they weren't authorized to discuss it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Highland said it lost as much as $100 million when RBS
            terminated a planned 500 million-euro ($668 million)
            collateralized-debt obligation at the height of the 2008
            financial crisis and then seized the underlying loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Edinburgh-based lender is being sued by as many as
            16,000 investors over a 2008 share offering before its collapse
            in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as other claims from
            customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for Highland in New York,
            declined to comment on the settlement. A spokeswoman for RBS in
            London declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. case is The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc v. Highland
            Financial Partners LP Ors, U.K. Court of Appeal (Civil
            Division) A3/2012/1474. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wabco Wins $272 Million Cut in EU Cartel Fine for Ideal Standard &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wabco Holdings Inc. (WBC) won a 203.4 million euro ($272 million)
            windfall after a European Union court cut the antitrust penalty
            it paid for Ideal Standard's involvement in a bathroom fittings
            cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU General Court in Luxembourg also trimmed Sanitec
            Corp.'s fine to 50.6 million euros from 57.7 million euros.
            Wabco was liable for the original fine as part of an accord
            linked to its spinoff from American Standard Cos. that predated
            the EU penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court said yesterday that EU regulators had wrongly
            held Ideal Standard guilty of colluding on the Italian market
            for ceramics for longer than was the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wabco paid all of the 326.1 million-euros fine levied in
            September 2010 'and will keep the full amount of the
            reimbursement' awarded by the EU court yesterday, the company
            said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sanitec, owned by EQT Partners AB, said in a statement it
            had made a provisional payment of 57.69 million euros in
            September 2010. It now expects to be reimbursed the difference
            plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the commission in
            Brussels, said the ruling 'confirms the substantial findings'
            of the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-412/10, T-411/10, T-408/10, T-396/10,
            T-386/10, T-380/10, T-379/10, T-381/10, T-378/10, T-376/10,
            T-375/10, T-373/10, T-374/10, T-382/10, T-402/10, T-368/10,
            T-364/10. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BT Loses Court Fight Over EU Order to Repay U.K. Pension Aid &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BT Group Plc, the U.K.'s largest fixed-line phone company,
            and its pension fund lost a court fight against a European Union
            order forcing repayment of as much as 16.6 million pounds ($26.5
            million) of exemptions from pension rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU General Court in Luxembourg yesterday rejected the
            appeals by BT and BT Pension Scheme Trustees against the
            findings of a European probe that the company benefited from
            unlawful government aid which had to be recovered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the 28-nation EU's antitrust
            regulator, concluded in 2009 that an exemption for the BT
            Pension Scheme to contribute to the country's Pension Protection
            Fund was unlawful state aid. The EU probe was started after one
            of BT's competitors complained to the Brussels-based regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. Pension Protection Fund was created in 2004 to
            guarantee pensions when sponsor companies go bankrupt and was
            financed by their contributions. BT's exemption was created
            under a so-called crown guarantee at the time of its
            privatization in 1984 to protect the staff's pensions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are disappointed with the decision, which is not in
            the best interests of BT Pension Scheme members,' Dan Thomas, a
            spokesman for the company, said in an e-mailed statement. 'We
            shall analyze the judgment in detail and decide upon next
            steps.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The commission's adverse decision had already been
            implemented'through changes to U.K.'pension'legislation'prior to
            the General Court's decision as required by EU law,' Thomas
            said. 'The court's decision maintains this status quo.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The amount to be recovered should be such as to eliminate
            the economic advantage given to BT which,' the EU decision
            said, 'is the beneficiary of the measure.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-226/09, British Telecommunications v.
            Commission, T-230/09, BT Pension Scheme Trustees v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

            policy differences that arose during the financial crisis. She
            also touched on the topic of her forthcoming book. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bair talked with Bloomberg's Pimm Fox and Carol Massar on

        <headline>Goldman-to-Soros Backed Mortgage Insurer Essent Files for IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd., the mortgage
            insurer backed by investors including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            and George Soros, filed for an initial public offering as
            investors pour capital into companies that guaranty home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc are
            managing the share sale, Bermuda-based Essent said yesterday in
            a regulatory filing. The proposed $287.5 million offering size
            is a placeholder amount used to calculate registration fees and
            may change. The prospectus didn't include information about the
            insurer's implied valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers have rallied this year as the U.S.
            residential real estate market rebounds and the government
            weighs scaling back its role in housing finance. MGIC Investment
            Corp. (MTG) and Radian Group Inc. sold stock and notes this year to
            rebuild capital. Losses had mounted at the companies as
            homeowners defaulted during the housing slump, triggering
            payouts on policies sold prior to the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Essent was created 'to serve the U.S. housing finance
            industry at a time when the demands of the financial crisis and
            a rapidly changing business environment created the need for a
            new, privately funded mortgage insurance company,' the firm
            said in the filing. Its mortgage guarantee unit was formed in
            late 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The following year, Essent agreed to pay as much as $30
            million for software and other assets from Triad Guaranty Inc.,
            a mortgage insurer hobbled by losses from soured home loans.
            Competitor PMI Group Inc. ceased writing new coverage and filed
            for bankruptcy in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Essent's Expansion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As those companies stopped writing new business, Essent
            expanded. The firm accounted for 9.2 percent of coverage sales
            in the first six months of this year, up from 5.2 percent a year
            earlier, according to data compiled by Inside Mortgage Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The insurer posted net income of $30.8 million in the six
            months ended June 30, compared with a net loss of $12.5 million
            a year earlier, according to the filing. Premium revenue more
            than tripled from the same period in 2012, as losses and
            expenses were almost unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the offering may be used for 'capital
            contributions to support the growth of our insurance
            subsidiaries,' according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Essent's investors include New York-based Goldman Sachs and
            Valorina LLC, which is majority owned by an entity that's
            managed by Soros Fund Management LLC, according to the filing.
            The company is planning to list its shares on the New York Stock
            Exchange under the ticker ESNT. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage insurers may benefit as the U.S. retools the
            housing-finance system. President Barack Obama said in a speech
            last month the government should play a smaller role covering
            soured home loans and that private capital should take more risk
            as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are wound down. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sees Surprising China Demand for Hong Kong Stocks</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese purchases of Hong Kong
            stocks through a planned exchange link may exceed estimates as
            individual investors buy casino and technology shares
            unavailable in Shanghai, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The link will give wealthy mainland investors access to 266
            stocks traded in Hong Kong, including Galaxy Entertainment Group
            Ltd. (27) and Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) China currently limits most
            overseas share investments to those made through asset managers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We might be surprised by retail participation once the
            stock connect is launched, given mainland investors' preference
            to invest and trade themselves instead of buying mutual funds,'
            Christina Ma, the head of Goldman's cash trading, equities in
            Asia Pacific ex-Japan, said in an interview in Hong Kong on
            Sept. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman's view follows a CLSA Ltd. survey last month
            showing 77 percent of mainland investors don't plan to
            participate in the bourse link, turned off by rules on the
            minimum account size and the exclusion of small-cap stocks.
            China, the biggest emerging economy, is counting on a successful
            exchange link to help liberalize its financial system, increase
            the role of the yuan and give its citizens more investment
            channels amid a slumping property market and increased risks
            from local wealth-management products. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Drawing Negative Loops as SBI Risk Climbs: India Credit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned
            that 'negative feedback loops' triggered by waning investor
            confidence are threatening India's finances, after state-owned
            lenders' bond risk surged the most in Asia this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investment bank said in a Sept. 16 report the rupee may
            drop to 72 per dollar in six months from 63.385 now as weaker
            capital inflows force the central bank to raise interest rates,
            hurting lenders and the economy. Rising bad loans then require
            more capital injections, further worsening perceptions of
            India's finances. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There might be a need to recapitalize banks above the
            budgeted amounts, but there is not much fiscal room available
            this year,' Tushar Poddar, Mumbai-based economist at Goldman
            Sachs, said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Banking Secretary Rajiv Takru said last month authorities
            may delay cash infusions into government-controlled banks, as
            the International Monetary Fund forecasts the government's
            deficit will reach 8.3 percent of the economy this year, the
            highest since 1987. Credit-default swap prices on State Bank of
            India, a sovereign proxy, surged 32 basis points to 307 this
            quarter, the worst in the Markit iTraxx Asia ex-Japan
            investment-grade index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The next-worst performers were also state-owned lenders.
            Contracts on IDBI Bank Ltd. jumped 27 basis points to 342, while
            those on Bank of India leapt 25 basis points to 325. China
            Development Bank was the best performer, declining 43 basis
            points to 104. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Increasingly Tough' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world's
            biggest bond fund, warned this week that India faces risks of
            ratings reductions. The chance of a downgrade by major credit
            agencies is 'large' even as 'outright default' is unlikely,
            Roland Mieth, Pimco Asia's EM senior vice president, said in an
            interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Compared to previous years, it's increasingly tough now
            for the government to sustain the cost of capital infusion,'
            said M. Narendra, chairman of Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), in a
            telephone interview from Chennai yesterday. 'A sustained period
            of difficulties is inevitable.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India may delay injecting capital into state-run banks
            including IDBI and Indian Overseas Bank because it doesn't want
            to lose money on price declines when buying lenders' shares,
            Takru said in an Aug. 19 interview. The government, which
            usually infuses cash by buying lenders' shares, doesn't want to
            lose money on stock price declines, Takru said. While the SP
            BSE Bankex index, a gauge for 13 banking stocks, has rebounded
            from a 20-month low marked on Sept. 3, it remains down 17
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Slowing Economy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government needs to provide 910 billion rupees ($14.3
            billion) of equity capital to state-run lenders by March 2018 in
            order to maintain its current stakes, Duvvuri Subbarao, who was
            governor of the Reserve Bank of India at the time, said in
            October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's economic advisory council
            said last week that containing the fiscal deficit within the
            budget estimate of 4.8 percent 'could be a challenge.' The
            ratio was 4.9 percent in the year through March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Capital adequacy ratios at the state-run banks under the
            so-called Basel II rules averaged 12.4 percent as of March 31,
            data compiled by the central bank show. That exceeds India's
            minimum regulatory requirement of 9 percent. A higher figure
            shows lender's ability to absorb bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's currency and bonds have dropped this year as Asia's
            third-largest economy expanded 4.4 percent last quarter from a
            year earlier, the least since the three months ended March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Positive Possibility &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The yield on India's 7.16 percent rupee-denominated bond
            due May 2023 fell 7 basis points to 8.37 percent yesterday,
            according to central bank prices. It reached a five-year high of
            9.23 percent on Aug. 19. The rupee was little changed yesterday
            after slumping as much as 13 percent this year, making it the
            worst performer in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think the commitment to banks on infusing capital will
            be met as it will strengthen the fundamentals of the economy,'
            D. R. Dogra, managing director of CARE Ratings Ltd., said in a
            Sept. 17 telephone interview from Mumbai. 'The central bank as
            a regulator will respond to the developing situation pro-actively.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Central bank governor Raghuram Rajan faces pressure to
            signal a reversal this week in his predecessor's tightening
            measures. Rajan will hold the repurchase rate at 7.25 percent
            tomorrow, his first meeting in charge of the central bank,
            according to all 34 economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Higher Costs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, whose report was meant 'to illustrate the
            risk of feedback loops, not to predict them,' wrote that there
            is also the possibility of a positive circle in which any
            improvement in the current account could lead to stability in
            the rupee. That in turn could encourage capital inflows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Takru's retreat from earlier comments that India will
            inject as much as 140 billion rupees by September comes after
            the proportion of bad loans and restructured assets as a
            percentage of total lending rose to a 10-year high of 10.02
            percent at the end of June, central bank data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Soured loans in the banking system rose to 3.92 percent of
            total lending as of June 30, the highest in at least five years,
            from 3.4 percent at the end of March, according to central bank
            data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Expectations that the bad loan situation will worsen are
            not out of place,' Pratip Chaudhuri, chairman of State Bank of
            India (SBIN), said in a telephone interview yesterday. 'It looks
            imminent the government will have to bear a higher cost for
            supporting the banks.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Loan Leads Bahrain's Arcapita Out of Chapter 11</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Arcapita Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment house that filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S.
            last year, exited bankruptcy after receiving a $350 million loan
            from Goldman Sachs International. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the restructuring deal, a new entity
            named RA Holding Corp., owned by the creditors, will realize the
            value of Arcapita's investment portfolio, the bank said in a
            statement on its website. The Goldman Sachs-led loan will fund
            cash flow requirements of the new entity and pay obligations
            connected to the restructuring, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies including Kuwait's Global Investment House KSCC,
            Dubai World Corp. and Dubai-based Nakheel PJSC were forced to
            restructure billions of dollars of debt after lending evaporated
            and asset values plummeted during the global credit crisis.
            Arcapita filed for bankruptcy in March 2012 after negotiations
            with creditors over a $1.1 billion syndicated loan failed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chapter 11 was a challenging experience, but one which
            has enabled us to deliver a solution in the best interests of
            our investors, creditors, and other stakeholders,' Chief
            Executive Officer Atif Abdulmalik said in the statement. 'We
            will be able both to assist RA and investors to maximize the
            value of the existing investment portfolio and to undertake new
            investment opportunities.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The existing management team at Arcapita will continue to
            lead the bank's investment portfolio with the aim of maximizing
            sale values. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reorganization is effective from Sept. 17. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Serves Crucial Physical Commodities Role, Blankfein Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s physical
            commodities unit is a 'core' business that provides a crucial
            service to clients, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein
            said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The role we play in that business is very, very important
            to users in the market,' Blankfein, 58, said in an interview
            with CNBC. 'Without us in that market, a good credit, a
            regulated company, the outcomes won't be very good for the users
            of the market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. lawmakers have questioned whether banks should be
            allowed to own physical commodities businesses and the Federal
            Reserve said it's reviewing a decision it made a decade ago that
            allowed commercial banks to enter the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn't been pressured by regulators to exit
            its physical commodities units, Blankfein said. The New York-based firm is in a different position than some
            commercial banks
            because Goldman Sachs was already in the commodities business
            when it became a bank holding company and didn't need approval
            from regulators later on, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Blankfein worked in the firm's J. Aron commodities unit,
            which also produced Chief Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz
            and President Gary D. Cohn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That is a core, strategic business for us,' Blankfein
            said. 'Commodity hedging is no different to people who have
            risks in the commodities markets -- which are real, iconic
            American companies -- as their credit risk or interest-rate
            risk. And we provide that service.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Hatzius Sees 'Significant Impact' From Rate Projection</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve projections for
            where the federal funds rate will be in 2016 are a central piece
            of information being released in conjunction with the policy-maker meeting ending today, said Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. chief
            economist Jan Hatzius. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That is the first time that FOMC participants are going
            to be telling us where they see monetary policy that far out in
            the future,' Hatzius said of the Federal Open Market
            Committee's two-day session on Bloomberg Television's Market
            Makers with Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker. 'Our
            expectation is that most of the participants will project
            something in the low two's, but I think there will be a
            significant impact from whatever they do.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fed policy makers will also probably decide today whether
            to taper $85 billion in monthly bond buying at their meeting in
            Washington, dialing down monthly Treasury purchases by $5
            billion to $40 billion while maintaining mortgage-backed
            securities purchases at $40 billion, according to a Bloomberg
            News survey of economists. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'No tapering would definitely be a surprise,' Hatzius
            said. 'Investors are very much on board with the idea that you
            get some tapering.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Fed will also release its economic forecasts today, and
            Hatzius said 'it is pretty clear that 2013 growth numbers are
            going to have to come down.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's Leme Says Brazil Unit Returned to Profitability</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s Brazil
            unit returned to profitability in the fourth quarter as the
            departure of several managing directors helped cut costs and
            fixed-income gains offset an investment-banking revenue drop. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We made the right decision in anticipating that this year
            would be less vibrant for investment banking, and had some
            opportunities for cost reductions when some executives left
            after receiving good job offers,' Paulo Leme, named Goldman
            Sachs's president and chief executive officer for Brazil today,
            said in an interview in Sao Paulo. Leme, 59, didn't say how long
            the New York-based company had been losing money in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs eliminated bonuses for some bankers in Brazil
            this year, contributing to the departures of five executives in
            January, people familiar with the matter said in February. The
            company reduced employees in investment banking to 25 from 45,
            the people said. Fabio Bicudo, the former co-head of investment
            banking, left in January to become CEO of Rio de Janeiro-based
            power company Eneva SA, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs began trading Brazil Treasury bonds in the
            second half of last year, 'and now we are the most active bank
            in the primary market and one of the top four in the secondary
            market, competing head-to-head with local players,' Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, whom Leme is replacing, said
            in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vollbrechthausen will move to New York after Leme's
            appointment is approved by Brazil's central bank, to become
            Goldman Sachs's head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities
            sales for Latin America. Leme was previously chairman for
            Brazil, a position that will be eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The drag from lower investment-banking revenue is also
            being offset by gains in private equity, structured credit,
            mezzanine financing and non-performing loan acquisitions, said
            Vollbrechthausen, who is a Goldman Sachs partner, a nod to the
            firm's history as a private partnership before going public in
            1999. Leme is a managing director, one level below partner. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With about 300 employees in Brazil, about the same as the
            level at the start of last year, the bank is 'well-staffed'
            for now, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
            Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
            the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
            Sachs's revenue from investment banking had been falling in
            Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
            people familiar with the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Treasury Error Said to Block Goldman Sachs From Auction of Bills</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
            prevented from participating in the Sept. 9 auction of three-month U.S. Treasuries because of a malfunction
            with the
            government's online order system, according to a person with
            direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One bidder couldn't participate in the sale of three-month
            bills due to a 'technical error' with the government's TAAPS
            system, the Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt said Sept. 10 on
            its website. Goldman Sachs was the firm that was locked out,
            according to a person briefed on the event, who asked not to be
            identified because the discussions were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The disruption in the Treasury auction comes as U.S.
            regulators press for improvements in the infrastructure of
            American equity and derivatives markets. Following Nasdaq OMX
            Group Inc.'s three-hour trading halt on Aug. 22, Securities and
            Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White told U.S. stock
            markets on Sept. 12 to collaborate on bolstering technology
            systems. On Sept. 9, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
            requested industry input on safeguarding markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Public Debt 'continues to test its systems
            to maintain the smooth functioning of Treasury auctions,' it
            said on Sept. 10. The government said attempts to address the
            Sept. 9 malfunction 'ultimately resulted' in the bidder buying
            more than 35 percent of the six-month bills that were sold,
            which normally isn't allowed. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Becomes Second Biggest Holder in Batista's OSX</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. became the
            second-largest shareholder in Eike Batista's OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) as
            the shipbuilding unit of the former Brazilian billionaire faces
            a possible restructuring of $500 million in bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs acquired OSX shares on Sept. 3 to reach a
            5.22 percent stake, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in a
            regulatory filing today. OSX is the worst-performing stock in
            Batista's commodities group this year with a 92 percent slump. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Batista, Brazil's richest person until November, is selling
            assets and restructuring his group of publicly traded
            commodities and logistics startups after a series of missed
            operational and financial targets eroded investor confidence.
            Creditors representing about 60 percent of OSX bondholders hired
            law firm Bingham McCutchen LLP in preparation for the possible
            restructuring of the company's 2015 bonds, two people briefed on
            the arrangements told Bloomberg News on Sept. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
            declined to comment on the share purchase in an e-mail sent by
            an external public relations representative in Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a minority investment that does not involve a
            change in the composition of corporate control or a change in
            the management structure of the company,' the firm said in a
            letter accompanying the OSX filing. 'Currently, the shareholder
            does not target any quantity of the company's shares.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OSX fetches 0.06 times book value, making it the cheapest
            stock among 264 companies trading in Brazil with a market value
            of at least $100 million, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The entrepreneur created OSX to supply vessels to
            sister company OGX Petroleo Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3), which is in
            talks with creditors in a bid to avoid bankruptcy protection. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;OSX rose 1.3 percent to 80 centavos in Sao Paulo today, the
            highest since Sept. 9. This year's slump is the steepest in the
            Ibovespa small cap index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Start Hedge Fund for Asia</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Investment Partners,
            set up to allow clients to invest with some of the bank's top
            proprietary traders, is raising capital for a new Asian fund,
            said two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The fund, named Oryza Capital, started early this month,
            said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            information is private. It is overseen by a team led by Hideki Kinuhata in Tokyo and Hong Kong-based Ryan
            Thall, said the
            people, who didn't disclose how much money the fund is seeking
            to gather. Kinuhata and Thall didn't reply to e-mails seeking
            comment on the new fund. Connie Ling, a Hong Kong-based
            spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asia's economic growth that has outperformed the U.S. and
            Europe, and renewed interest in Japan, where Prime Minister
            Shinzo Abe has committed to ending deflation, are attracting
            global investors. Inflows into Asia-focused funds took regional
            hedge-fund assets to $98.4 billion as of the end of June, the
            highest since 2007, according to Chicago-based data provider
            Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Asia is still one of the fastest-growing regions in the
            world, albeit at a slower pace, so it's no surprise that there
            is continued interest in notable Asian launches,' Will Tan, a
            managing director who focuses on the hedge-fund industry at
            Singapore-based recruiting firm Principle Partners Pte, said.
            'The past year especially has seen renewed global interest in
            Japan resulting in a surge in hiring for Japan-focused
            investment professionals.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Tesla Drops as Goldman Says $6 Billion Needed for Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) fell after a
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst said the company may need at
            least $6 billion in capital, most of it over the next 11 years,
            if its electric car becomes a 'disruptive' product. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The automaker led by Elon Musk is targeting production of
            100,000 premium electric cars by late next year and has an
            eventual goal to sell at least 500,000 cars annually. The
            capital may be needed to fund growth if Tesla's vehicles prove
            to be as popular as Apple Inc.'s iPhone or Ford Motor Co.'s
            Model T. Under such scenarios, production would range from 1.8
            million a year to 3.2 million a year by 2025, Patrick Archambault, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote today
            in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With numerous projects laid out (as well as those not
            currently communicated) ahead for Tesla, we see a possible need
            for additional capital,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla also is building a battery factory to provide cheaper
            lithium-ion cells for its vehicles. It said the facility may
            cost as much as $5 billion. In March, the company raised about
            $2.3 billion toward the plant, which is being built near Reno,
            Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Archambault, who has a neutral rating on Palo Alto,
            California-based Tesla, said the bulk of his estimate for the
            company's capital needs would be for 2017 through 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tesla hasn't given a forecast for capital spending, Simon Sproule, a spokesman, said in an e-mail.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The stock fell 1.7 percent to $259.32 at the close in New
            York. The shares have risen 72 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, Tesla said today it released a software update
            for its Model S. New features include traffic-based navigation,
            commute advice, remote starting and the ability to give your car
            a nickname, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managing
            director Jason Lee pleaded not guilty to charges he raped a
            woman at his rental home in East Hampton, New York, the wealthy
            beach community on the east end of Long Island. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jason Lee, 37, wearing a dark suit and accompanied by his
            wife, was arraigned today before Suffolk County Judge Barbara
            Kahn in Riverhead, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee, of Manhattan, was arrested and charged with first-degree rape in August after police went to

            home and learned that a woman had been sexually assaulted inside
            the residence, where several people had gathered, according to a
            police statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A grand jury indicted Lee last month on one count of first-degree rape, which carries a maximum
            sentence of 25 years in
            prison, and misdemeanor counts of assault and sexual misconduct,
            according to court records. He was freed at the time on $20,000
            cash bail. Bail was set today at $100,000 cash, with the $20,000
            applied to that amount. Lee left the courthouse after posting
            the additional bail. He was ordered to turn in his passport. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;On Leave &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lee's employer wasn't identified in the police statement.
            Lee is head of convertibles at Goldman Sachs and has been placed
            on leave, according to a person familiar with the matter who
            wasn't authorized to speak publicly about a private personnel
            matter and asked not to be named. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Hedge Funds Keen on China Exchange Link, Goldman Sachs Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Hedge funds may drive initial
            demand for Shanghai-listed stocks through a linkage of the
            city's bourse with that in Hong Kong, which opens up a new route
            for foreign investors to buy Chinese shares, according to
            Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The link will tap into pent-up demand from hedge funds to
            buy yuan-denominated class-A shares traded in Shanghai, said
            Shane Bolton, head of Asia prime brokerage at the New York-based
            bank. Long-only managers may grapple with pre-trade requirements
            that are different from their usual practice at the beginning,
            he added. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Foreign investors so far can only buy yuan shares listed in
            Asia's second-largest stock market through the qualified foreign
            institutional investors, or QFII, and the renminbi QFII
            programs. The link, set to start next month, will allow
            investors, with or without their own QFII licenses, to buy as
            much as 13 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) of Shanghai-traded yuan
            stocks a day, according to a Sept. 4 statement posted on the
            Hong Kong stock exchange's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Stock connect will be a game changer for most hedge
            funds, allowing them to access A shares for the first time
            without having to use banks' QFII quota,' Bolton said in an
            interview in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Sukuk Seen as Too Risky for U.S. Imitators</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. banks will probably wait to see if issuing Shariah-compliant bonds is worth the trouble after
            it took Goldman Sachs Group Inc. three years to sell its debut sukuk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islamic finance in
            the U.S. is still underdeveloped, and misconceptions associated with it taint the industry, according to
            King Spalding LLP, an adviser on Shariah transactions in the country for 35 years. HSBC Holdings Plc, the
            biggest underwriter of sukuk this year after Malaysia's CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., says the need for tangible
            assets to structure deals, and the lack of legislation to address taxation issues, makes selling Islamic
            bonds a challenge. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's highly likely that Goldman will be the sole player in the
            Islamic finance market in any meaningful way for the near term,' George Thomas Conboy, chairman of
            Rochester, New York-based Brighton Securities Corp., a financial services company, said by phone from
            Istanbul on Sept. 18. 'There aren't as many players willing to take risks in that area until Goldman blazes
            a trail and it's clear that Islamic finance can be properly structured and profitable.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman
            Sachs, the fifth-biggest bank in the U.S., sold its debut sukuk last week, three years after its first foray
            into Islamic capital markets ended with controversy over the debt's structure. It's the fourth U.S.-based
            issuer to sell the securities. Borrowers raised $2 trillion from all bond sales in America last year, more
            than 46 times the amount sold in the Shariah market and more than the value of Islamic financial assets
            globally. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Negative Perception &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hong Kong, the U.K., South Africa
            and Sharjah, one of seven sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates, are among borrowers that have sold Islamic
            bonds for the first time this year. New York-based Goldman Sachs's five-year notes yielded 21 basis points
            more than similar maturity non-Shariah compliant debt it issued in January at 3:21 p.m. in Dubai. The bank
            attracted orders for three times the $500 million it sold. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Islamic finance's level of
            awareness and depth of knowhow in general in the U.S. is at best at its infancy, with negative connotations
            stemming misconceptions,' Rizwan Kanji, a Dubai-based partner at King Spalding, said by telephone from Dubai
            Sept. 18. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islam is the most negatively perceived religion in the U.S., followed by
            atheism, according to a study by the Washington-based Pew Research Center published in July. About 1.9
            million Muslims live in the country, the seventh-biggest religious group among about 319 million people,
            according to CIA World Factbook data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risk Premium &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Goldman
            Sachs's sukuk won't 'create a market of new issuers in the U.S., frequent conventional issuers will start to
            see sukuk as a new avenue for tighter pricing or diversification of their investor base,' Kanji said.
            Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase Co. were among the biggest issuers of debt last
            year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rob Julavits, a spokesman for Citigroup,
            Zia Ahmed from Bank of America and Jessica Francisco from JPMorgan declined to comment last week on whether
            the lenders will be pursuing Islamic financing deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stamp Duties &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borrowers
            using sukuk need assets to underlie the debt and there's an additional cost of hiring Shariah scholars or
            boards to structure the securities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If you're a U.S. corporate that doesn't have
            tangible assets it can utilize, it's more challenging to structure' a sukuk, Mohammed Dawood, HSBC's
            Dubai-based global head of sukuk financing, said in a Sept. 11 interview. 'The U.S. hasn't passed
            sukuk-specific legislation, unlike Hong Kong and the U.K., which have passed legislation to address tax and
            legal impediments.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To adhere to Islam's ban on interest, the bonds pay a return on
            assets and may attract double charges on stamp duties because of the sale and purchase of goods to back the
            debt. Profits or capital gains incur taxes, whereas interest is tax deductible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islamic
            finance is too new for U.S.-based issuers, and the structures and impediments are too complicated, Conboy
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Anything with Shariah attached to it carries a small risk premium,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's McClymont Named Sotheby's CFO; Sheridan Leaving</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sotheby's (BID), the New York auctioneer
            under pressure to improve returns, said Patrick McClymont, a
            partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is replacing its chief
            financial officer of 17 years, William Sheridan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A 1991 graduate of Cornell University, McClymont has been a
            managing director in investment banking at Goldman since 1998,
            Sotheby's said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrew Gully, a Sotheby's spokesman, said the move is
            unrelated to corporate activism by investor Daniel Loeb, whose
            Third Point LLC has taken a 5.7 percent stake in the auction
            house, according to an Aug. 26 filing with the U.S. Securities
            and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The hedge-fund company 'intends to engage in a dialogue
            with members of the board or management' that may relate 'to
            potential changes of strategy and leadership,' the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Bill and Sotheby's came to a mutual agreement that he
            would no longer serve as CFO after being at Sotheby's for 17
            years,' Gully said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McClymont takes over Oct. 7. Sheridan will remain at the
            company until the end of the year, according to the release. The
            company said on Sept. 11 that it's 'conducting a thorough
            review of its capital allocation and financial policies.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Estimates Cut by Atlantic</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The biggest U.S. banks' fixed-income trading revenue will probably fall 20 percent in the
            third quarter from a year ago on lower volumes, according to
            Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staite cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s per-share earnings 18 percent to $2.47
            and Morgan Stanley's 25
            percent to 38 cents, according to a research note today. Staite
            also cut his estimate at Citigroup Inc. (C) by 14 percent to $1.05. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank, and Barclays
            Plc have told investors that third-quarter trading revenue will
            probably drop from a year earlier. Jefferies Group LLC said last
            week that revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent
            in its fiscal third quarter that ended Aug. 31 compared with the
            same period in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'July and August were very slow months as investors sat on
            the sidelines waiting for more clarity on Fed tapering, Syria
            and the emerging-market slowdown, and we believe the weakness
            has extended into September,' Staite wrote in a note, referring
            to uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve would slow its $85
            billion-a-month bond-buying program. 'In contrast September
            2012 was very active in rates and foreign exchange due to
            improvements in the Eurozone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mortgage production revenue at the biggest banks will
            probably be down 55 percent, Staite added. That's because the
            third quarter in 2012 was 'a strong period for both volumes and
            margins,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1,800 Jobs &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, said
            last week that it's cutting about 1,800 jobs in its home-loan
            production business as rising interest rates curb demand for
            refinancing. Chief Financial Officer Timothy Sloan said Sept. 9
            that the San Francisco-based bank may originate about $80
            billion in home loans during the third quarter, a 29 percent
            decline from the three months that ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Staite previously cut his estimates for JPMorgan by 14
            percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) by 10 percent following their
            comments at a conference, he wrote. Wells Fargo's estimates were
            held flat. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We think Bank of America will show better underlying cost
            and revenue trends than its major peers,' Staite said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Atlantic Equities has an 'underweight' recommendation on
            Morgan Stanley (MS), U.S. Bancorp, and Wells Fargo, a 'neutral'
            rating on Goldman Sachs, and an 'overweight' recommendation on
            Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and PNC Financial Services
            Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said in Talks for Stake in Brazil Toll Collector</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private-equity fund and General Atlantic LLC are in talks to buy a 12.75
            percent stake in STP -- Servicos Tecnologia de Pagamentos SA,
            the Brazilian electronic-toll-collection company, two people
            with direct knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toll-road operator EcoRodovias Infraestrutura Logistica
            SA hired Banco Itau BBA SA to sell its stake in Osasco-based STP
            for about 250 million reais ($114 million), the people said,
            asking not to be identified because the negotiations are
            private. The talks, which include additional potential buyers,
            are preliminary and may not lead to a deal, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The number of vehicles traveling Brazil's toll roads rose
            4.2 percent in the past 12 months, according to Brazil's
            Association of Highway Concessionaires. STP sells Sem Parar and
            Via Facil tags, which car owners use to pay tolls and parking
            fees. CCR SA (CCRO3), the biggest toll operator by revenue, and CCBR
            Catel Construcoes do Brasil Ltda are STP's biggest shareholders,
            with a combined 73.25 percent, according to data on STP's
            website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;STP said last month it agreed to sell a 10 percent stake to
            Raizen Energia SA, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell Plc
            and Cosan SA Industria Comercio, for 250 million reais, in a
            capital increase that will dilute holdings of most existing
            shareholders when completed. Highway-concession company Arteris
            SA will retain its 4.68 percent stake after the deal, which must
            still to be approved by Brazil's antitrust regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;FleetCor Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FleetCor Technologies Inc., a Norcross, Georgia-based
            provider of fuel cards and workforce payment products to
            businesses, said on Sept. 10 it agreed to acquire DB Trans SA, a
            provider of payment solutions for independent truckers in Brazil
            and also an electronic-toll-collection company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;STP, EcoRodovias and Itau declined to comment, according to
            officials who asked not to be named in keeping with company
            policies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to
            comment in a e-mailed statement. Pat Hedley, a spokeswoman for
            General Atlantic, said the company's policy is not to comment on
            investments it may be considering. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs Said to Expand Electronic Bond-Trading Sessions</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has added
            trading sessions and increased the money it makes available to
            buy securities on its electronic bond-trading platform as the
            industry grapples with changes in market structure, according to
            a person briefed on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will hold two daily sessions on its platform,
            up from twice weekly when it started last year, and will offer
            $300 million in guaranteed liquidity, said the person, who asked
            not to be identified because the change hadn't been publicly
            announced. The platform, known as GSessions, was halted last
            month amid a lack of demand, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Corporate bond dealers and investors have started
            electronic-trading platforms as they seek to reduce costs and
            improve their ability to convert investments into cash amid new
            capital rules. The world's biggest dealers have cut inventories
            of corporate debt by three-quarters since the 2007 peak, leading
            to concerns that waning liquidity provides greater potential for
            market disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While clients have been wary of trading on so-called
            single-dealer platforms run by one bank, the sell-side hasn't
            agreed on parameters that would allow one multidealer platform
            to emerge, according to two people involved in the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs began trading on GSessions in June 2012,
            after a year of development. The expansion will allow clients to
            trade 35 bonds -- including investment-grade and high-yield
            securities -- each day, the person said. GSessions is housed
            within the New York-based bank's credit-trading unit and remains
            a small part of that group's revenue, according to the person. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Technology Shifts &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
            comment. The Financial Times reported the changes to Goldman
            Sachs's system yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The corporate bond market is unsuitable for full electronic
            trading, according to a study last month by McKinsey Co. and
            Greenwich Associates. The bond market has more securities
            compared with listed stocks and its issues trade at a lower
            frequency, making a full transition to computer-based buying and
            selling unlikely, the consultants said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, set up
            an internal electronic bond-trading system that would match
            orders from buy-side investors, allowing them to bypass Wall
            Street dealers. The system failed in April because it couldn't
            attract a critical mass of customers, even as small dealers
            stood ready to aid trading. The New York-based firm said in
            April it would instead route trades through MarketAxess Holding
            Inc.'s electronic system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS) revamped its electronic brokering system,
            called Bond Pool, last year, offering sessions based on client
            interest. JPMorgan Chase Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. announced
            plans to start electronic bond-trading platforms this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While technology and shifts in market structure have added
            to the appearance of fixed-income market liquidity, they have
            added little depth, according to a July report by the Treasury
            Borrowing Advisory Committee. Trading volumes of investment-grade debt dropped in August to the lowest since
            2008. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Insatiable Insurers Seen by Goldman Draining Debt Premium</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. life insurers are piling into
            the shadows of the corporate-bond market to boost income, even
            as rising demand reduces the extra yield they get paid to hold
            the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About $728 billion of debt known as private placements were
            held by insurers at the end of 2013, up from $678 billion two
            years earlier, according to Fitch Ratings. Insurers are shifting
            into harder-to-trade assets that generally offer higher yields
            than publicly registered and actively traded securities, causing
            those premiums to evaporate, according to Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the investment-grade world today, that liquidity
            premium is virtually gone,' John Melvin, who oversees fixed-income investments for insurers at Goldman Sachs
            Asset
            Management, said by phone. Insurers 'really have almost an
            insatiable demand for investment product on the long end of the
            yield curve,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With hundreds of billions of dollars to reinvest annually
            and interest rates held near record lows by the Federal Reserve,
            insurers are looking beyond public, investment-grade bonds,
            according to BlackRock Inc. (BLK) In addition to private placements,
            they're weighing infrastructure bets and real estate, said
            BlackRock's David Lomas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Natural Holder' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Insurance companies are a natural holder' of less liquid
            assets, said Lomas, who runs BlackRock's global financial
            institutions group. 'They've got great cash flow, and they can
            afford to extend their strategy into some of these areas.'
            Insurers can hold premiums on life policies for decades before
            paying death benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Borrowers may choose private loans and bonds to limit
            financial disclosures and save administrative costs. While that
            contributes to the higher yields, it makes the debt harder to
            sell should an insurer need to exit a holding to pay claims or
            cut credit risk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'To the extent that you need to sell a security and
            liquidate it, there's less ability to do that without impacting
            the price,' said Shachar Gonen, an analyst at Moody's Investors
            Service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Evaporating Premium &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At New York Life Insurance Co., the extra yield from less
            liquid investment-grade debt has dropped by about half over the
            last two years, to a range of 20 to 25 basis points, according
            to Tony Malloy, who oversees a portfolio that was valued at more
            than $185 billion at the end of 2013. A basis point is 0.01
            percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Malloy's company, the largest policyholder-owned U.S. life
            insurer, allocates about 30 percent of its portfolio to private
            placements and mortgage loans, up from about 25 percent five
            years ago, he said. Since 2008, New York Life has built a
            business to make its own loans, reducing its reliance on other
            firms that originate the debt. That's helped maintain spreads,
            Malloy said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The competition for assets amongst insurance companies is
            fierce, and so we had demand that was greater than the supply,'
            Malloy said. 'A way of meeting the demand that New York Life
            had was to essentially open up the regional offices and go
            knocking on the doors of corporations.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Private Equity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Goldman Sachs surveyed chief investment officers in
            February and March, it found that insurers saw holding less-liquid assets as among the best strategies for
            increasing
            returns. Insurers planned to boost allocations to private
            equity, commercial mortgages, real estate equity and mezzanine
            debt, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While the interest in investment-grade traditional
            private placements has been quite strong for the last several
            years, that's probably waning,' Melvin said. Insurers are
            'moving down the credit curve.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. said in June that it had
            committed $1.5 billion to a venture with Oak Hill Capital
            Management that will lend to mid-sized companies. The business,
            called Varagon Capital Partners, will lend to companies with
            earnings of as much as $75 million before interest, tax,
            depreciation and amortization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yields on investment-grade company bonds have dropped to
            3.11 percent, less than 0.5 percentage point from the record-low
            reached last year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            index data. That compares with an average of 4.77 percent over
            the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Price Disclosures &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority began
            disseminating prices for the first time in June on debt issued
            privately under a rule known as 144a, the latest step in the
            agency's effort to make over-the-counter debt markets more
            transparent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With spreads declining for private bonds, the increase in
            demand is probably nearer to the end than the beginning, said
            Robert Derrick, co-head of the North American corporate finance
            group at insurer Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)'s private-lending
            unit. The challenge is that the extra yield for taking on risk
            is dropping across asset classes, said Alton Cogert, whose
            Strategic Asset Alliance advises insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You don't get a whole heck of a lot,' Cogert said.
            'Nowadays, it's so hard to get compensated for taking risk,
            it's crazy.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman's European Spot FX Trading Head Said to Leave</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)'s European head of spot foreign-exchange trading, Mitesh Parikh, is
            leaving after 12 years to join a hedge-fund firm, according to two people with knowledge of the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Parikh, 35, is resigning to trade currencies at an investment firm, said the people, who asked not
            to be identified because the move isn't public. Parikh, who worked in London, didn't respond to a message
            left with a colleague or to e-mails to his work address. He joined Goldman Sachs in July 2002, according to
            his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on the move. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His departure marks the continued exodus of traders from banks amid cost cutting and increased
            regulation that prevents proprietary trading and limits the capital trading desks may put at risk. The
            number of bankers doing business in the Group of 10 currencies shrank to 2,278 in the first half of this
            year from 2,929 in the same period of 2010, according to London-based consulting firm Coalition Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators are also probing the $5.3 trillion-a-day market over allegations dealers leaked
            confidential client information and colluded to rig benchmarks. The scandal may cost lenders as much as $15
            billion in fines, according to Chirantan Barua, a London-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. Parikh's
            move is unrelated to any investigations, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Talented Individuals' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's no surprise to see talented individuals looking to move to a less constrained environment,'
            said John Purcell, chief executive officer of London-based executive-search firm Purcell Co. 'In the
            political heat generated during the recent downturn, regulators became over zealous trying to out do each
            other with their 'bash the banks, tough-guy approach.'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Citigroup's
            Jeffrey Feig and Deutsche Bank AG's Christopher Fahy were hired by Fortress Investment Group LLC, the first
            publicly traded private-equity and hedge-fund manager in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rohan Ramchandani,
            Citigroup's former European head of foreign-exchange spot trading, began at an online-trading firm earlier
            this month. Darren Coote, global head of spot foreign exchange at Lloyds Banking Group Plc, resigned for
            personal reasons in April. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank's global head of foreign exchange, Kevin
            Rodgers, left in June after 15 years to join the performing arts. He recently sang the parts of four
            villains in Jacques Offenbach's 'Tales of Hoffmann' and is set to appear in the Gilbert and Sullivan
            operetta 'The Mikado' in London. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
            Chase Co. and billionaire George Soros are poised for gains
            from a housing bet placed in the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Essent Group Ltd. (ESNT), the Bermuda-based mortgage insurer that
            raised $500 million from a group including those backers in
            2009, filed last week to sell shares in the first initial public
            offering of a home-loan guarantor in almost two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The industry is rebounding from record homeowner defaults
            that triggered payouts, forced almost half the companies out of
            the business and pushed some of the biggest survivors to the
            brink of default. With property prices now rising at the fastest
            pace since 2006 and the government reducing its role backing
            home loans, firms that sold policies before housing collapsed --
            Radian Group Inc. and MGIC (MTG) Investment Corp. -- are attracting
            new investors to replace capital lost in the slump. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We still think it's the best way to play the housing
            recovery,' Jack Micenko, an analyst at Susquehanna
            International Group LLP in New York, said of mortgage insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Radian and MGIC, which were unprofitable for most of the
            past six years, have more than doubled in 2013 in New York
            trading. Homebuilders in comparison are down 0.6 percent this
            year after slumping 20 percent since a May peak. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>J.C. Penney Plummets as Goldman Raises Liquidity Concerns</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney Co. (JCP), the retailer
            trying to reverse $1.6 billion of losses in the past year, sank
            the most in almost seven months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            said its liquidity will be strained this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares fell 15 percent to $10.12 at the close in New
            York for the biggest one-day since Feb. 28, the day the
            department-store chain reported the lowest annual sales since at
            least 1987. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Weak fundamentals, inventory rebuilding, and an
            underperforming home department will likely challenge J.C.
            Penney's liquidity levels in the third quarter,' Kristen McDuffy, at New York-based analyst for Goldman,
            wrote yesterday
            in a note to clients. 'In order to safeguard against a
            potentially poor fourth-quarter holiday season, it is likely
            that management will look to build a bigger liquidity buffer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McDuffy initiated J.C. Penney's debt at an underperform
            rating. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since taking over in a second stint as chief executive
            officer in April, Mike Ullman has borrowed money to shore up the
            finances, and re-introduced discounts and brought back
            merchandise to help recover from his predecessor's failed
            attempt to transform the company. The retailer has taken out a
            $2.25 billion loan, arranged by Goldman, and drawn down $850
            million from its credit revolver. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant Inc., a maker of
            software that analyzes data and makes predictions, raised $13.5
            million from a group of investors including Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. (GS) and Bank of America Corp. to fund expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each bank will get a seat on the Seattle-based company's
            board, said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Purpura, who founded
            the company in 2012. The banks will also use Context Relevant's
            technology, the company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant also raised funds from New York Life
            Insurance Co. and existing venture investors Formation 8 and
            Bloomberg Beta. The company raised $21 million three months ago,
            and total funding to date is $42 million. Bloomberg Beta is a
            unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We raised another round because we are growing
            exponentially and achieved all the goals set by the previous
            round,' Purpura said in an interview. He declined to comment on
            the company's valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant's technology can be used to predict
            external and internal threats such as hacking, data theft and
            insider trading, and the company generates revenue from annual
            software licenses. The software developer is seeking to boost
            the number of employees to 200 from the current 50, and needs to
            hire analysts, sales staff and customer-service representatives,
            Purpura said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Context Relevant also said it hired Richard Clarke, former
            U.S. National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism, as
            acting head of its security products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Data, Security &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In the wake of recent breaches at banks, exchanges, hedge
            funds, payment processors and retailers, it is clear that there
            is a market for Context Relevant to deliver automated
            intelligent systems to help address these challenges,' Clarke,
            who was already advising Context Relevant, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase Co. and at least other four banks were
            attacked last month by Russian hackers who stole gygabites of
            customers' data people familiar with the investigation have
            said. Home Depot Inc. (HD) and Target Corp. (TGT) have also been the target
            of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other startups such as Palantir Technologies Inc., a

        <headline>Dollar Rally to Gain Fuel as ECB Talks Stimulus, Goldman Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Factors ranging from monetary-policy divergence to inflation trends indicate the dollar's
            rally against its major peers during the past four months has
            scope to continue, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dollar Index posted its a 10th consecutive gain
            last week, the longest streak since 1967, and reached 85.485
            today, the highest level since July 2010. It also still trades
            at almost its 10-year average, as measured by the
            Intercontinental Exchange Inc. gauge that tracks the greenback
            against the currencies of six U.S. trading partners. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As big as the dollar move looks close up, it is actually
            small in historical and economic terms,' Robin Brooks,
            Goldman's New York-based chief currency strategist, wrote in a
            note to clients today. In 'reaction to client meetings in
            recent days, many have sticker shock at the recent strengthening
            in the dollar and are instinctively on the sidelines as they
            await/ hope for a pull-back,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. currency may build on its gains versus the euro as
            the region's central bank meeting next week will highlight
            policy and economic divergence. European Central Bank President
            Mario Draghi will have an opportunity to further explain his
            plans to expand the central bank's balance sheet via bond-buying, Brooks wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Inflation Range &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The meeting is also likely to bring focus to below-target
            inflation within the currency bloc nations. Draghi's preferred
            gauge of inflation expectations, the five-year/five-year
            inflation swap rate, fell to 1.91 percent on Sept. 19, the
            lowest on a closing basis since October 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We do not think euro-dollar at current levels remotely
            prices the kind of balance sheet expansion that President Draghi
            talked about in September,' Brooks wrote. 'So that coming
            press conferences, including next week's, are an opportunity for
            the ECB to spell out the way forward, which we think will set
            the stage for more euro-dollar downside.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since reaching $1.3993 on May 8, the strongest in 2 1/2
            years, the euro has slumped 9.1 percent as the currency bloc's
            economic expansion stopped in the second quarter as its three
            biggest economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- failed to
            grow. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman cut its six-month forecast on the single currency
            last month to $1.25 from $1.34, and projects it will weaken to
            parity by the end of 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve officials increased their median estimate
            for the federal funds rate to 1.375 percent at the end of next
            year on Sept. 17, versus June's forecast for 1.125 percent and
            virtually zero now. The extra yield investors get from holding
            U.S. Treasuries instead of Germany's two-year bunds rose to 0.64
            percentage point yesterday, the widest since April 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The recent dollar strength has really been an unusual
            confluence of idiosyncratic trends,' Brooks wrote. 'We expect
            the coming months to bring higher front-end rates in the U.S. as
            Fed forward guidance fades, giving rise to real dollar strength.
            This is not an environment conducive to a pull-back.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Aabar Said to Work With Goldman Sachs on Options for RHB Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Aabar Investments PJSC, owned by
            Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund, is working with Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. (GS) as it explores options for its stake in RHB Capital
            Bhd. (RHBC), according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aabar, the Malaysian bank's second-largest shareholder with
            a 21.2 percent stake, is seeking to protect the value of its
            investment as the lender negotiates a three-way, $27 billion
            merger with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) and Malaysia Building
            Society Bhd., the people said. It hasn't yet signed a formal
            mandate with Goldman Sachs, one person said, asking not to be
            identified as the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIMB, Malaysia's second-biggest bank, and RHB are
            discussing structuring the deal as a reverse takeover, people
            familiar with the matter said this month. The structure of the
            transaction, which would value RHB at about 1.4 times book
            value, is designed to overcome any potential resistance from
            Aabar as it would require approval from only a majority of RHB
            investors, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman
            Sachs, declined to comment. Aabar officials didn't respond to
            several e-mails and phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Aabar bought its RHB stake from Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank
            PJSC for 10.80 ringgit per share in 2011, when RHB was the
            target of a takeover battle between the country's biggest lender
            Malayan Banking Bhd. and CIMB. RHB shares traded at 8.86 ringgit
            at 3:07 p.m. today in Kuala Lumpur, 18 percent below Aabar's
            purchase price. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;EPF's Vote &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIMB, RHB and Malaysia Building Society (MBS) in July announced
            plans for a three-way merger that would create the country's
            largest banking group by assets. The companies, which have a
            combined market value of about $27 billion, entered into a 90-day exclusive agreement to negotiate and
            finalize the price and
            structure of the merger, according to a July 10 joint statement
            from the lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under a proposal being discussed, RHB would issue new
            shares to acquire CIMB, whose market value is two and a half
            times bigger, people familiar with the talks said earlier this
            month. An outright acquisition by CIMB would require approval
            from 75 percent of RHB shareholders, leaving Aabar in a stronger
            position to scuttle the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Even so, engaging with Aabar may become more important amid
            uncertainty about whether Malaysian pension manager Employees
            Provident Fund, which owns stakes in all three banks, will be
            allowed by the country's stock exchange to vote on the deal. EPF
            controls 40.9 percent of RHB. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EPF wrote to the three lenders on Aug. 26, saying it should
            be given a waiver allowing the fund to vote on the proposed
            merger, Malaysian newspaper The Star reported Sept. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CIMB and RHB are discussing making the merger proposal
            conditional on EPF being allowed to vote, three people familiar
            with the talks said. The exclusivity period for the merger talks
            expires Oct. 8. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Global Atlantic Buys Forethought for Post-Goldman Growth</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic Financial Group,
            the insurer divested by Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. this year,
            agreed to buy closely held Forethought Financial Group Inc. to
            expand sales of life and retirement products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase will increase assets at Global Atlantic to
            more than $31 billion, the Bermuda-based insurer said today in a
            statement that didn't include terms. Forethought had $6.3
            billion in assets as of Dec. 31, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic, led by Chief Executive Officer Allan Levine, is expanding distribution after
            Goldman Sachs sold a
            majority stake in the firm to private investors. The insurer
            announced in May that it would buy Aviva Plc's U.S. life
            business, with $10 billion of assets, in a reinsurance deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Forethought's leading annuity distribution and pre-need
            business will further diversify our product mix and position us
            to provide a full range of innovative life and annuity
            solutions,' Levine said in today's statement. Pre-need policies
            provide funds that can pay funeral costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic was founded in 2004 at Goldman Sachs and
            acquired Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Co. in 2005.
            The firm also offers reinsurance under the Ariel Re brand.
            Global Atlantic had $1.75 billion in equity, the company said in
            a May 1 statement announcing the separation from New York-based
            Goldman Sachs, which maintained a stake. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Forethought's surplus, a measure of assets minus
            liabilities, was about $470 million as of Dec. 31. The Houston-based company agreed in 2012 to acquire an
            individual annuities
            distribution unit from Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.,
            and entered the variable annuity market this year, according to
            Forethought's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Caskets, Funerals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hillenbrand Industries Inc., a maker of caskets, agreed to
            sell Forethought to Devlin Group LLC in 2004 for about $280
            million, according to a statement at the time. Hillenbrand
            started Forethought to sell coverage that paid for funerals when
            policyholders died. Mark Kollar, a spokesman for Global Atlantic
            at Prosek Partners and David Entrekin at Forethought declined to
            comment on terms of the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Global Atlantic's transaction is expected to be completed
            in early 2014, according to the statement. Debevoise Plimpton
            LLP provided legal advice to Forethought, the law firm said in
            an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said capital requirements by international
            banking regulators pushed the retreat from insurance. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Alfa Said to Hire Citigroup, Goldman for Sigma Food Unit IPO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA), the Mexican maker of car
            parts and petrochemicals, hired Citigroup Inc. (C) and Goldman Sachs
            Group Inc. for an initial public offering of its Sigma Alimentos
            SA food division, according to two people with direct knowledge
            of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB also
            are among the banks working on the transaction, said the people,
            who asked not to be identified because details of the planned
            sale, including the timing and size, haven't been set. Alfa fell
            0.5 percent to 36.67 pesos at the close in Mexico City, after
            earlier advancing as much as 3.7 percent. The benchmark IPC
            index of 35 companies fell 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sigma's IPO would be the second in two years from San Pedro
            Garza Garcia-based Alfa, which sold shares of petrochemical
            division Alpek SAB in April 2012. Sigma has been expanding
            through acquisitions, with purchases in the second quarter of a
            Costa Rican cheesemaker and a Mexican processor of beef, poultry
            and pork. In 2010 Sigma bought Phoenix-based Bar-S Foods Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enrique Flores, a spokesman for San Pedro Garza Garcia,
            Mexico-based Alfa, didn't respond to e-mails and phone calls
            seeking comment on the company's plans for Sigma. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Angeles Meraz, a press official with Citigroup's Banamex
            unit, declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a Goldman
            Sachs spokesman, and Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for Bank of
            America. Ayax Carranza, a press official with Banorte, didn't
            respond to phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alfa shares have soared 35 percent this year, the fourth-best performance on the nation's benchmark
            IPC index, giving the
            company a market value of 189.4 billion pesos ($14.5 billion) at
            yesterday's close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sigma accounted for about a quarter of Alfa's 2012 earnings
            before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure
            of profit known as Ebitda. It contributed about 23 percent of
            sales. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Premier Farnell Gains as Goldman Recommends Buying: London Mover</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Premier Farnell Plc (PFL) climbed as much
            as 3.9 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
            recommendation to buy, saying the U.K. supplier of electronic
            and industrial products stands to increase market share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares climbed 2.2 percent to 215.60 pence at 12:48
            p.m., for the biggest gain on the FTSE 350 Index today. That
            took the advance to 11 percent this year, giving the company a
            market value of 800 million pounds ($1.29 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman upgraded its recommendation from neutral because
            Premier Farnell 'is well positioned to take advantage of
            improving market conditions,' analysts led by Charles Wilson
            said in a note today. It 'stands to gain market share from
            small 'mom and pop' competitors and improve sales due to its
            extensive product offering in conjunction with its improved
            online platform.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Premier Farnell will focus on segments including
            nanotechnology, medical, lighting and energy rather than
            industries such as defense, which are affected by spending cuts,
            Chief Executive Officer Laurence Bain said in an interview on
            Sept. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Economic confidence in the euro area rose in September,
            adding to signs the single-currency bloc's recovery is gaining
            momentum. An index of executive and consumer sentiment rose for
            a fifth month to 96.9 from a revised 95.3 in August, the
            European Commission in Brussels said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. consumer confidence advanced to the highest in almost
            six years in September, and labor productivity rose for the
            first time in two years in the second quarter, led by the
            manufacturing industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of 17 analysts who follow Premier Farnell and share their
            findings with Bloomberg, nine recommend buying the stock, four
            suggest holding and four advise selling. The average 12-month
            price target for the stock is 245.55 pence, based on 11
            estimates, implying a potential gain of 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Estimates Lowered by Hintz</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
            Stanley (MS) had their earnings estimates lowered by Brad Hintz, a
            Sanford C. Bernstein Co. analyst, amid a decline in trading he
            called 'a full-scale rout.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hintz cut Goldman Sachs's third-quarter per-share earnings
            estimate by 15 percent to $2.62 and the full-year estimate by
            8.6 percent to $15.59 per share, according to a note today about
            the two New York-based banks. Morgan Stanley's per-share third-quarter estimate was decreased 20 percent to
            41 cents, and the
            2013 figure dropped 4.8 percent to $1.98. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While the third quarter is typically seasonally soft, Q3
            2013 appears to be turning into a full-scale rout in trading as
            weak activity and limited risk-taking constrained performance,'
            Hintz wrote. Fixed-income trading volume could decline 20
            percent to 25 percent on average in the three months ended Sept.
            30, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Analysts have been reducing their third-quarter earnings
            estimates for the biggest U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase Co., the
            nation's largest lender, said trading revenue will probably fall
            this period and Jefferies Group LLC said revenue from fixed-income trading plunged 88 percent in its fiscal
            third quarter,
            which ended Aug. 31, compared with a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Marty Mosby, an analyst for Guggenheim Securities LLC,
            downgraded shares of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Corp.,
            the second-biggest U.S. bank, to neutral from buy as revenue
            from capital-markets and mortgage banking declines, according to
            a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fixed-income trading revenue at the biggest U.S. banks will
            probably fall 20 percent in the third quarter from a year
            earlier amid lower volume, Richard Staite, an analyst at
            Atlantic Equities LLP, said in a note this week. That led him to
            cut his estimate for Goldman Sachs's per-share third-quarter
            earnings by 18 percent and Morgan Stanley's by 25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Goldman Said to Be Among Buyers of $1.5 Billion Dong Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is part of
            a group that's close to buying a stake in Dong Energy A/S,
            Denmark's largest utility, a person involved in the transaction
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group, which includes a unit of New York-based Goldman
            and Danish pension funds ATP and PFA, will pay more than 8
            billion kroner ($1.5 billion) for a stake that's greater than 20
            percent, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
            the talks are private. Danish newspaper Borsen reported earlier
            today that Goldman and the two funds are seeking a stake,
            without saying how it obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Denmark's government said in February it will sell a stake
            in the Skaerbaek, Denmark-based utility which is restructuring
            after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Goldman would be
            the lead buyer taking a greater stake than the pension funds,
            the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman wouldn't say if the bank is seeking to buy a stake
            in Dong, according to an e-mail from Joanna Carss, a London-based spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The parties are still negotiating terms for how they would
            exit the investment, the person said. The buyers want a clause
            allowing them to sell their stake to the government or a
            timetable for an initial public offering of Dong shares, the
            person said. &lt;/p&gt;

            Dong is selling shares as part of a financial restructuring announced in February to cut costs, reduce debt
            and bolster investments in oil and gas exploration as well as offshore wind farms. Close

        <headline>Buffett Poised to Get $2 Billion Goldman Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway
            Inc. (BRK/A) will get more than $2 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
            stock through warrants acquired during the depths of the 2008
            financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Berkshire will receive about 13.1 million shares in Goldman
            Sachs, according to an agreement that uses the average closing
            price on the 10 trading days through today to calculate
            Buffett's stake. The bank fell 1 percent to $158.21 at 4:15 p.m.
            in New York, valuing the holding at $2.07 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs turned to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in
            2008 to bolster capital and shore up market confidence when
            shares plunged following the collapse of Lehman Brothers
            Holdings Inc. Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive
            officer, invested $5 billion for a preferred holding and got
            warrants to buy $5 billion of stock for $115 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Buffett used his position as a white knight and his
            reputation to prop up an institution at a time of crisis,' said
            Richard Cook, co-founder of Cook Bynum Capital Management LLC.
            'Goldman Sachs is almost certainly better off for it, even
            though it was very expensive. And certainly Berkshire
            shareholders are better off.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, redeemed the
            preferred stake in 2011 at a 10 percent premium. Buffett agreed
            in March to exercise the warrants through a cashless
            transaction, in which he passed on a chance to spend $5 billion
            for stock at below-market prices. He instead gets an amount of
            stock equivalent to his paper profit, based on closing prices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Citigroup Reviewing Trading Rules After Goldman Move</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. will review its conflict-of-interest policy for investment bankers after Goldman
            Sachs Group Inc. barred some employees from owning individual securities, said a person with direct
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Executives at Citigroup still regard its less-restrictive
            policy as strong enough to prevent conflicts, according to the person, who asked for anonymity because the
            review isn't public. The New York-based bank also may consider how the rest of the industry reacts to
            Goldman Sachs's decision before taking action, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which
            previously required bankers to get approval before they could trade individual securities, told employees
            about the change on Sept. 26, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said at the time. Banks monitor
            staff investments to prevent insider trading and to counter claims that they put the interests of employees
            ahead of clients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's six years after the crisis and they are still facing continued
            litigation, so if you were in that foxhole wouldn't you do something?' said Roy Smith, a finance professor
            at New York University's Stern School of Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. 'You protect yourself
            by causing these restrictions.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs changed its policy on the day that public
            radio and ProPublica reported the story of a former Federal Reserve Bank of New York examiner who secretly
            recorded her ex-colleagues' dealings with the New York-based bank. The examiner, Carmen Segarra, sued the
            New York Fed last year, alleging she was fired in 2012 because she refused to change her finding that
            Goldman Sachs didn't have a conflict-of-interest policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Citigroup's current rules, amended in June, include a list of stocks that employees are forbidden
            from trading, according to Robert Julavits, a bank spokesman. Staff must seek approval from managers and the
            compliance unit to trade other stocks and bonds, and bankers are restricted from investing in securities or
            funds from the industries they cover, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citigroup also requires managing
            directors and directors to disclose stakes they hold in companies that hire the bank, Julavits said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are always looking at ways to enhance our policies and procedures,' he said in an e-mailed
            statement. He declined to comment on the bank's plans to review its policy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spokesmen
            for JPMorgan Chase Co. and Bank of America Corp., the two largest U.S. banks, declined to comment, as did a
            representative of Morgan Stanley, owner of the world's biggest brokerage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Restricting
            Transactions &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Co. 'has long-standing policies and monitoring controls in
            place that require team members to obtain pre-approval for personal securities transactions' and may
            restrict trades if the company believes there could be a conflict, Elise Wilkinson, a bank spokeswoman, said
            in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2012, a Delaware judge rebuked Goldman Sachs over its
            'incomplete and inadequate' handling of a conflict of interest in pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc.'s
            $21.1 billion purchase of El Paso Corp., the investment bank's biggest takeover assignment the previous
            year. Stephen D. Daniel, a former Goldman Sachs partner who was lead banker on the deal, failed to disclose
            ownership of about $340,000 in Kinder Morgan stock, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>
