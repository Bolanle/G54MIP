        <headline>Ex-Microsoft Employee Pleads Guilty to Trade Secret Theft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) employee Alex
            Kibkalo pleaded guilty to leaking company trade secrets to a
            blogger in France and agreed to pay $22,500 in restitution and
            spend three months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kibkalo, a Russian national who worked for Microsoft in
            Lebanon, admitted he uploaded pre-release updates for Windows 8
            and a software development kit for guarding against copyright
            infringement to his online backup storage in July and August
            2012, according to a plea agreement filed yesterday in federal
            court in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kibkalo provided the blogger with links to the files in his
            account, encouraging him to share the development kit with
            others who might be able to write 'fake activation' codes
            based on the software, according to the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The kit's value 'is substantial to Microsoft because it
            prevents software piracy across the line of Microsoft
            products,' according to the agreement, which is subject to a
            judge's approval. Sentencing is scheduled for July 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft was alerted to the theft in 2012 by an individual
            who asked that his identity not be disclosed. He learned of
            Kibkalo's theft when the blogger contacted him for help
            examining code for the Microsoft Activation Server Software
            Development Kit, a product developed for internal Microsoft use
            only, according to the criminal complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Internal Investigation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company's internal
            investigation traced the leaked information to Kibkalo, a seven-year employee who was working as a software
            architect in
            Lebanon, prosecutors said. He has worked for another U.S.
            technology company since he returned to Russia, prosecutors
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of the company's internal investigation, Microsoft
            gained access to the blogger's Hotmail account, which contained
            e-mail messages from Kibkalo with pre-release 'hot fixes' for
            Windows 8 for mobile devices that weren't publicly available,
            according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'While Microsoft's terms of service make clear our
            permission for this type of review, this happens only in the
            most exceptional circumstances,' the company said in a March 20
            statement. 'We apply a rigorous process before reviewing such
            content.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v Kibkalo, 14-00087, U.S. District Court,
            Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Says Windows to Be Free for Some Mobile Devices</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is making its
            Windows licenses free for mobile phones and tablets that have
            screens of less than nine inches, in a move to spur adoption of
            the software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company has historically made
            Windows available to hardware makers for a licensing fee. That
            has put Microsoft at a disadvantage to Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Android
            mobile operating system, which is offered for free to device
            manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co. and which has
            become the most widely used software in smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft made the announcement at its Build developer
            conference in San Francisco where it also showed off its new
            Windows Phone 8.1 mobile software with a voice-search feature
            called Cortana. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Windows stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone
            operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual
            growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at
            that rate, Windows Phone would only make up 7 percent of the
            total market in 2018, compared with Google's Android software at
            76 percent and Apple's iOS at 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC
            said. For Microsoft's Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Unveils Phone Software With Rival to Apple's Siri</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. renewed its push to catch up with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in mobile devices,
            unveiling updated Windows Phone software with voice-search features and offering it for free for small
            phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which previously required a licensing fee for Windows,
            will offer it without charge for handsets and tablets with screens of less than nine inches, Microsoft
            operating systems chief Terry Myerson said at the company's Build conference for developers in San Francisco
            today. Microsoft also showed off a voice-controlled digital assistant called Cortana that is similar to
            Apple's Siri, which is part of a new Windows Phone 8.1 software for mobile gadgets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief
            Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who was appointed to lead the world's largest software maker in February,
            is working to remake Microsoft for an era where smartphones and tablets have become central. To do so, he
            must strike a balance between offering Microsoft's software for competing platforms while still keeping the
            company's Windows operating system as a core focus. Today's event was designed to re-emphasize the
            importance of Windows to the Redmond, Washington-based company and to spur adoption of the software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;
            Apple's Maestri Takes Top Finance Role Amid Cash Scrutiny
            Atop the Electronics World, Samsung Now Chasing Innovation
            &lt;p&gt;'Reinvigorating the Windows franchise continues to be a key ingredient in Microsoft's recipe for
            success as it looks to offset headwinds from the secular challenges in the PC market,' Daniel Ives, an
            analyst at FBR Capital Markets Co., wrote in a note. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Delicate Balance &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella's
            tricky balancing act was underscored by two Microsoft events last week and this week. The CEO last week
            debuted Microsoft Office software for Apple's iPads and said he'll 'hold nothing back' to get the company's
            programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker's longtime focus on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In contrast, this week's Build conference puts Windows front-and-center by giving developers tools
            and tactics to boost Microsoft's single-digit share in phones and tablets, as well as providing money-making
            opportunities in a contracting personal-computer market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're going to innovate with a
            challenger mindset,' Nadella said at the event. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In making Windows free for smaller
            phones and tablets, Microsoft is working to narrow the gap with Google, which distributes its Android mobile
            operating system to hardware manufacturers at no cost. Android has become the most widely used software in
            smartphones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Start Menu &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Myerson also said the company
            is restoring the Windows start menu, which will be made available to users as an update. The company yanked
            the feature from Windows 8, triggering customer complaints. Microsoft also showed Office applications for
            Windows that are redesigned for use with touch controls, one week after showing similar apps for Office for
            the iPad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Vice President Joe Belfiore said the new Windows Phone 8.1 will have
            an action center, which is a pull-down menu that gives people access to basic functions regardless of
            whether programs are already open. The software, which will start rolling out in the next few months on
            existing phones and on new devices later this month and in early May, also lets users customize their
            phone's lock screen and offers new choices for tweaking the start screen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cortana
            Speaks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cortana, which 'fully replaces the search function on Windows Phone,' according
            to Belfiore, is named for the artificial-intelligence character in Microsoft's best-selling Halo Xbox
            video-game series. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers outside Microsoft can write their own apps for Cortana,
            Belfiore said. With users' permission, Cortana can learn about consumers from their searches, keep track of
            people they interact with and set up an 'inner circle' of the most important people and who can contact
            users during the times of day they set as 'quiet hours.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Belfiore demonstrated how he
            allowed Cortana to scan his e-mail, causing the program to ask him whether to track an Alaska Airlines
            flight mentioned in an e-mail itinerary. The program can be used to start a Skype call, add a TV show to the
            user's Hulu queue or check a friend's Facebook posts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'She's great at helping me get
            things done, whether its by talking or typing,' Belfiore said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Windows Share &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj's handset division, which is being acquired by Microsoft in a deal set to close this
            month, will begin selling new phones using Windows Phone 8.1, said former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop. The 930 is
            a high-end device that will debut in June and feature wireless charging, while two cheaper phones designed
            for emerging markets will become available in May, said Elop, who will become Microsoft's executive vice
            president of the devices group when the transaction with Nokia is completed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows
            stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual
            growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at that rate, Windows Phone would only make up
            7 percent of the total market in 2018, compared with Google's Android software at 76 percent Apple's iOS at
            14 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC said. For Microsoft's
            Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global computer shipments fell a record 10
            percent last year and are forecast to continue to decline this year as tablets and smartphones lure
            consumers away from traditional desktop and notebook designs, according to IDC. Tablet sales volume --
            dominated by Apple and Google, whose operating systems account for 95 percent of that market -- will rise an
            average 16 percent annually through to 2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One possible boon to Windows developers:
            Microsoft is working on obtaining tools, via acquisition or development, to make it easier for application
            developers to target multiple operating systems without having to rewrite software. The company is
            considering an acquisition or investment in Xamarin Inc., or other companies that enable mobile apps to run
            on different devices, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. Microsoft may also build those
            capabilities itself, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Moving San Francisco Offices to Largest Tower</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will move its San
            Francisco offices to the city's largest tower as it relocates to
            the heart of the financial district from the technology-heavy
            South of Market area. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's biggest software maker will move in December to
            Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)'s 555 California St., San Francisco's
            largest building by square footage and second-tallest, said
            Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
            Microsoft. He wouldn't comment further on the relocation plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;San Francisco is the 'center of the U.S. new economy'
            after four years of sustained rent growth, according to
            property-research firm Green Street Advisors Inc. Office rents
            rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to
            $57.21 a square foot on average, with vacancies little changed
            at 11.3 percent, brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) said. Asking
            rents have climbed 70 percent since 2010, when rates bottomed at
            $33.57 a square foot. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft had the ability to go anywhere in the city,'
            David Greenbaum, president of Vornado's New York office
            division, said today in a telephone interview. The 555
            California building is 'incredibly iconic both in San Francisco
            and the country.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will occupy about 50,000 square feet (4,600
            square meters) on the second and third floors, said a person
            with knowledge of the plans. Rent will be about $62 a square
            foot for the two floors, said the person, who asked not to be
            identified because the details are private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Street View &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greenbaum declined to comment on financial terms. He said
            the tower's second floor has 27-foot (8-meter) ceilings,
            allowing Microsoft to establish a unique presence visible from
            the street. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asking rates in San Francisco's north financial district
            averaged $58 a square foot in the first quarter, up 7.8 percent
            from a year earlier, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
            Microsoft's Yammer Inc. unit, with 76,000 square feet in Twitter
            Inc.'s headquarters building in the Central Market area, won't
            be affected by the parent company's move, the person with
            knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 52-story tower between Montgomery and Kearny streets
            has 1.5 million square feet of office space and 45,000 square
            feet of retail, according to Vornado's website. At 779 feet, the
            building is surpassed in San Francisco only by the 853-foot
            Transamerica Pyramid, according to property website Emporis.com. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The California Street high-rise, opened in 1969, is the
            main building in a complex that was known as Bank of America
            Center before the financial company moved to Charlotte, North
            Carolina. The skyscraper was featured in the 1974 disaster film
            'The Towering Inferno,' according to Emporis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft currently occupies space at Westfield Group (WDC)'s San
            Francisco Centre, the city's biggest mall. The property, at
            Market and Fifth streets, is between the Union Square shopping
            district and the SOMA area, where companies including Google
            Inc. and Salesforce.com Inc. have offices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>TCL Multimedia China Game Console to Compete With Microsoft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings
            Ltd. (1070) will make a game console in China after the nation lifted a
            14-year ban on the devices, challenging competitors including
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and ZTE Corp. (000063) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia's T2 game player features a joystick that's
            compatible with mobile games for Google Inc.'s Android system so
            they can be played on any TV, the Hong Kong-based company said
            in a statement. The video-game industry in China will generate
            about $10 billion in 2015 revenue, according to
            PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese authorities reversed course in January on a
            nationwide ban on video-game consoles that was implemented in
            2000 to protect youths from perceived corrupting influence.
            Microsoft and the potential China market entry of devices from
            Sony Corp. or Nintendo Co. will pose a challenge for TCL, said
            Christopher Tse, a Hong Kong-based analyst at RHB Research
            Institute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It does not have the content base to draw gamers from the
            Xbox and Playstation crowd,' Tse said of TCL's device. 'Even
            though it has secured exclusive titles from Gameloft, I think
            stronger titles are needed to kick start the platform.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia shares rose 2.6 percent to close at HK$3.16
            in Hong Kong trading today. They have lost 12 percent so far
            this year, compared with a 3.4 percent drop in the benchmark
            Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, ZTE &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ZTE, China's second-biggest maker of phone-network
            equipment, announced a venture last month with online game
            developer The9 Ltd. (NCTY) to make a gaming console called the Fun Box. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In preparation for the lifting of China's console ban,
            Microsoft and BesTV New Media Co., a subsidiary of Shanghai
            Media Group, formed a $79 million gaming venture in September.
            Microsoft didn't say whether the venture would offer its Xbox
            console or a new device. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;TCL Multimedia is one of three listed subsidiaries of TCL
            Corp. (000100), China's largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, which
            was founded in 1981. TCL will make the console hardware, to be
            sold exclusively through JD.com Inc. Gameloft SE (GFT) will provide
            games, while China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) will help develop and
            operate a dual-screen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to its game console, TCL also announced a
            series of TCL 'Game TVs,' with six models featuring panels
            sized from 40 inches to 65 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

            Corp. honcho Nancy Tellem, who Microsoft hired 19 months ago to build a TV powerhouse from the ground up,
            the studio now has six series lined up -- including a science-fiction thriller called 'Humans' about
            humanoid robot workers -- and more than a dozen projects in development. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's unfamiliar
            ground for the world's largest software maker, which has zero experience in original TV programming and is
            wading into a crowded field where Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have generated hits such as 'House of
            Cards.' Yet Microsoft is betting on the new studio to produce shows that will attract consumers to its Xbox
            game console, lure subscribers to its Xbox Live online service and eventually anchor a consumer home
            entertainment network that will tie the company's devices together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'TV, as the
            highest-reach form of entertainment you can find, is a critical part' of wooing consumers to Microsoft, said
            Phil Spencer, who was last week named head of the Xbox business. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ericsson to Buy Microsoft's Mediaroom TV-Software Unit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Ericsson AB (ERICB) agreed to buy Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Mediaroom business, adding software used
            by phone companies to deliver television over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mediaroom, based in Mountain
            View, California, has more than 400 employees globally and will help Ericsson be the largest provider of
            so-called IPTV technology with a market share of over 25 percent, Ericsson said today in a statement.
            Ericsson paid less than $200 million, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be
            identified because the details are confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ericsson, the largest maker of wireless
            networks, is seeking to cater to carriers that compete with cable, satellite and Web-based providers. The
            move will also help Stockholm-based Ericsson step up its emphasis on software and services amid accelerating
            competition in hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mediaroom 'gives us a large installed based to work with and a
            great opportunity to move into an evolutionary path of IPTV into media distribution,' Per Borgklint, head of
            Ericsson's Business Unit Support Solutions, said in a phone interview. 'This gives us the bridgehead to grow
            this business significantly.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesmen referred Bloomberg to a blog post by
            the company in which it said the sale 'is mutually beneficial and strategically aligned for both parties'
            and will let the Redmond, Washington-based company 'commit 100 percent of its focus on consumer TV strategy
            with Xbox,' its game console. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The global IPTV market is estimated to reach 105 million
            subscribers in 2015, expanding to $45 billion by that year from $32 billion in 2013, Ericsson said. The deal
            is expected to close in the second half of this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ericsson advanced 0.3 percent to
            77.85 kronor in Stockholm today. Microsoft declined less than 1 percent to $28.59 at the close in New York.

        <headline>Microsoft Said to Adopt AMD Chips for Next Xbox Console</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will use an Advanced
            Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) processor in its next Xbox game console as it
            seeks to cut the cost of building machines and get developers to
            create more titles, people with knowledge of the matter said.
            AMD surged the most in almost two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Xbox will use an AMD system-on-a-chip that combines
            powerful 'Jaguar' central processing units with graphics
            chips, said one of the people, who sought anonymity because the
            plans aren't public. The shift to the so-called x86 format
            ubiquitous in modern personal computers means Microsoft will
            drop the Power PC technology designed by International Business
            Machines Corp. (IBM), and game discs made for the current Xbox 360
            won't be compatible. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The switch is a boon for AMD, which is also providing chips
            for Sony Corp. (6758)'s coming PlayStation 4, as it seeks a larger
            slice of the $67 billion global video-game market to help lessen
            its reliance on the shrinking PC industry. Microsoft also stands
            to benefit because game developers, who have moved toward making
            games for PCs and mobile devices, will find it easier to deliver
            those titles for the next Xbox. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We'll probably see many more titles because the console
            makers are saying the publishers are back in the driver's
            seat,' said Richard Doherty, president of technology consulting
            firm Envisioneering Group. Developers won't have to reinvent
            various features, such as 'smoke, shading and reflections for
            each machine and can essentially create once and port once, and
            be done.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>China Approves Microsoft, Nokia Deal With Conditions on Prices</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;China's Ministry of Commerce
            approved Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s bid to take over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s phone
            business after winning pledges from both that the transaction
            won't mean higher fees for the nation's smartphone makers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft pledged not to raise fees for its patents after
            the deal is complete, according to a statement posted on the
            ministry's website. Nokia pledged no large changes in its
            current compensation structure for standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese regulatory approval follows sign-off from the
            European Commission, the U.S. Justice Department and other
            jurisdictions and will allow the transaction to close this
            month, Espoo, Finland-based Nokia said in a statement today.
            Chinese phone makers including Huawei Technologies Co. had asked
            China to set conditions on the deal, two government officials
            with knowledge of the matter said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Chinese regulatory approval has been the remaining hurdle
            and now we expect the deal to close swiftly during April,' said
            Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Helsinki.
            'China is a key mobile devices market representing already a
            third of the global market volume.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;No government authorities requested the company make
            changes to its licensing or royalty terms, Nokia said in its
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft won't ban Chinese phone makers from using patents
            needed to comply with a technical standard, according to the
            statement from the Chinese regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Strategy &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said
            she didn't immediately have information available on the
            ministry's decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia has said completion of the transaction will allow it
            to unveil its new strategy and chief executive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rajeev Suri, the head its networks business, is among
            candidates for the top job. The new CEO will try to revive 149-year-old Nokia, which is intensifying its
            focus on wireless-network equipment as it faces a new start without the mobile-phone business that made it
            famous. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft, Nokia Complain to EU Over Google Mobile Dominance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A group representing Microsoft
            Corp. (MSFT), Expedia Inc. (EXPE) and Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) filed an antitrust complaint
            against Google Inc. (GOOG) over its Android operating system as part of
            a campaign to force the European Union to fine or alter the
            conduct of the owner of the world's largest search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FairSearch, a group of 17 technology and search companies,
            said the EU should investigate Google's 'deceptive conduct to
            lockout competition' in the mobile market with a goal to
            'cement its control over consumer Internet data for online
            advertising as usage shifts to mobile.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Google is using its Android mobile operating system as a
            'Trojan Horse' to deceive partners, monopolize the mobile
            marketplace, and control consumer data,' said Thomas Vinje, a
            lawyer in Brussels who represents the FairSearch industry group.
            'Failure to act will only embolden Google to repeat its desktop
            abuses of dominance as consumers increasingly turn to a mobile
            platform dominated by Google's Android.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU is already investigating Google's search business
            and the Mountain View, California-based company's rivals have
            made nearly weekly entreaties to the EU to take some action.
            TripAdvisor Inc. (TRIP) and Expedia led a group in March that wrote to
            EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, and Microsoft days
            later sent the EU a study questioning Google's search results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We continue to work cooperatively with the European
            Commission,' Al Verney, a Brussels-based spokesman for Google,
            said in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for Almunia, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Dominance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to FairSearch, Google's Android system was used
            as a smartphone operating system in 70 percent of handset units
            shipped at the end of 2012. Google also dominates mobile search
            advertising with 96 percent of the market, said FairSearch,
            citing eMarketer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft already has an antitrust complaint against Google
            pending with the Brussels-based commission, alleging the company
            promotes its own specialist search services, copies rivals'
            travel and restaurant reviews, and discriminates against rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. ended an investigation into Google's search
            business in January, saying there was no evidence that the
            company's actions harmed consumers. The commission, the EU's
            antitrust regulator, is seeking a deal with Google to end its
            more than two-year-old probe into antitrust concerns with the
            company's search business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Copied Reviews &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia last year asked Google to give him a detailed offer
            to address allegations that it copies rivals' travel and
            restaurant reviews, and has agreements with websites and
            software developers that stifle competition in the advertising
            industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After receiving Google's settlement offer in January,
            Almunia said he hoped to check it with rivals and customers 'in
            the coming months' and finalize it later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia said in an interview with the New York Times
            published yesterday that he expects new proposals from Google
            this week to help with concerns over its search practices and
            any changes the company proposed would be submitted to
            competitors for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almunia said the company needed to offer the commission a
            solution where choices between Google-branded search results and
            those of its competitors were clearly visible within the search
            engine both on desktop computers and on mobile devices, the
            Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Surface Warranty Criticized in China After Apple Woes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s after-sales
            service of its Surface tablet has attracted criticism from
            China's state-owned radio, following similar reports in the past
            month targeting Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Surface Pro should follow the nation's law requiring
            notebook computers to have a one-year repair warranty for the
            whole device and a two-year warranty for main parts, as compared
            with the company's one-year pledge for both, China National
            Radio reported yesterday. Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman
            for Microsoft, said she couldn't immediately comment on the
            report today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The criticism by China National Radio may be the opening
            shot against the world's largest software maker, similar to what
            Apple faced in the past month, said Doug Young, author of the
            book 'The Party Line: How the Media Dictates Public Opinion in
            Modern China.' After a March 15 report by China Central
            Television criticized Apple's customer service, the People's
            Daily published more than a dozen articles on the subject. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It sounds potentially worrisome; it looks a copycat of
            the whole Apple thing,' Young said. China National Radio 'is
            trying to jump on the same bandwagon,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Most western companies already provide much better after-
            sales service than Chinese companies, Young said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Rovi Corp., a provider of data and technology for on-screen
            television listings, lost a patent-infringement case against
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) over interactive programming. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amazon.com's Instant Video and IMDB Video didn't infringe
            two patents owned by Rovi's TV Guide for electronic program
            guides, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
            Washington said in an opinion posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rovi, which licenses data for television guides, has
            agreements with companies such as Sony Corp. and Google Inc. (GOOG) The
            Santa Clara, California-based company has had mixed results when
            companies balk at paying royalties on its technology. In
            November, it lost a lawsuit over Netflix Inc's software-development kits after a U.S. trade agency said
            other Rovi
            patents weren't infringed. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Lacoste SA, the French polo-shirt manufacturer, was given
            authorization to register 'L.12.12' as a trademark in
            Singapore over the objections of Carolina Herrera Ltd., the
            Straits Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New York-based Herrera tried to block the registration,
            saying the mark was too similar to its '212' marks used with
            fragrances, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although Lacoste uses 'L.12.12' with a fragrance,

            &lt;p&gt;After receiving a cease-and-desist notice from counsel for
            Canada's DHX Media Ltd. (DHX), a U.K. promoter dropped 'The Night
            Garden' as the name for an event set in a London cafe, the
            Hackney Gazette reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DHX produces 'In the Night Garden,' a children's
            television program airing on the U.K.'s child-oriented CBBC
            network, and didn't want the name to be associated with an event
            where alcohol would be sold, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alistair Siddons, the event promoter, told the Gazette he
            hadn't intended any association with the TV program and felt
            bullied into changing the name of the event to Star Garden. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Malibu Media Says No Defendant Passed Polygraph Examination &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Malibu Media LLC, a producer of adult films, said in an
            April 16 court filing that in the first three months of 2014, at
            least 175,000 U.S. residents infringed its copyrights through
            the use of the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In that same filing, the company said it has been using
            polygraph examinations and has agreed to dismiss infringement
            cases against any defendants who pass such a test. So far,
            Malibu Media said, no defendant has passed a test and all
            polygraph examinations have led to a settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The filing was made in one of 268 cases Malibu has filed in
            federal court in Chicago. Malibu claims that each defendant
            infringed, on average, 17.9 copyrighted works. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Malibu Media LLC v. Doe, 14-cv-00693, U.S.
            District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;FBI Warns About Russian Venture-Capital Companies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation told Boston-area
            technology companies to be wary of joint ventures with Russian
            venture-capital firms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece published in the Boston Business
            Journal, Lucia Ziobro, assistant special agent in charge of the
            FBI's Boston division, said the agency believes the true motive
            of some venture-capital firms funded by the Russian government
            is industrial espionage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The warning was also directed toward research facilities
            and Boston-area universities, the FBI said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials from two Russian venture-capital firms -- Russian
            Venture Co. and Rusnano OAO's Rusnano USA -- said they were
            doing nothing wrong and the FBI's allegations were unfounded,
            the Boston Globe reported. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Says Surface's 2-Year Warranty Follows China Law</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said its Surface
            Pro tablet and all other products meet or exceed warranty laws
            in China, denying a report in state media that its coverage of
            the device falls short of local requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consistent with Chinese law, Surface Pro and its main
            components are covered under a two-year warranty, Microsoft said
            in an e-mailed response to questions, sent through Graham Norris
            at Ogilvy Public Relations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China National Radio on April 8 reported the company had a
            one-year pledge for the Surface Pro. That followed a March 15
            report by China Central Television that criticized Apple Inc.'s
            customer service, which was followed by more than a dozen
            similarly themed articles in the People's Daily newspaper in the
            past few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We stand behind our products with a manufacturer's
            warranty, which is additional to our commitment to honor any
            statutory obligation as either a manufacturer or retailer, to
            repair or replace a faulty product,' Microsoft said in the
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, began selling
            Surface tablets in China in October. The company's first global
            sale of the device was done in Beijing as it wooed local
            consumers frustrated by long waits for Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Backs Israel as 'Silicon Valley Junior' for Innovation</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT), hurt by a slump in global PC sales, is looking to Israel for
            innovation from its developers and acquisitions, as well as local startups, according to the company's top
            executive in the country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We are trying to create assets for the company, and we
            recognize that we are Start-Up Nation and we can provide innovation,' Yoram Yaacovi, general manager of the
            Microsoft (MSFT) Israel RD Center, said in an interview in Tel Aviv, referring to the title of a book on the
            country's entrepreneurial culture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has acquired seven companies and made four
            strategic investments since 1989 in Israel, where it employs 800 people, including 500 in research and
            development. These developers are focused on business intelligence for cloud computing, said Yaacovi.
            Resulting products, such as an Excel tool for the cloud that was integrated into Office 365 BI software,
            help give companies insight into their data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Business intelligence is an area of
            double-digit growth' for the software maker, said Yaacovi. 'We in Israel do all the cloud-based business
            intelligence for Microsoft. We can envision business intelligence migrating to the cloud and then we will
            build it in Microsoft.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based software maker is looking for new
            sources of revenue as falling demand for PCs crimps demand for traditional applications. Global PC shipments
            fell 14 percent to 76.3 million units in the first quarter, according to Interactive Data Corp. The slump
            was the steepest since IDC began tracking shipments in 1994. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Technology Advantages &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It is important to understand what Microsoft is seeking in Israel,' said Yaacovi. 'It's not a big
            market and labor isn't cheap. What it is looking for is technology advantages and entrepreneurial spirit.'
            Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer describes Israel as Silicon Valley Junior, he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A
            system to deliver tailored advertisements to Microsoft's Bing search engine and Live Mail was developed in
            Israel by engineers from YaData, a company Microsoft bought in 2008. Face- recognition technology developed
            by a small team in Israel is now used in Microsoft's Bing, Photo Gallery, and Kinect motion- sensing
            software, Yaacovi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft invested more than $700 million in Israeli
            acquisitions between 2002 and 2009, according to Israel Advanced Technology Industries, a group representing
            technology companies and related businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Startup Programs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            (MSFT)'s Israeli purchases include Internet security company Whale Communications, data-organizing
            specialist Zoomix Data Mastering Ltd. and Gteko, a maker of networking and support software. The company met
            with more than 600 startups last year in its quest for acquisitions, Yaacovi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A
            year ago, Microsoft (MSFT) also began offering a series of four- month 'accelerator' programs to help
            startups for the cloud, mobile and online markets. Twenty-three companies have benefited from the courses so
            far. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We recognize that we need to be more in touch with startups,' Yaacovi said. 'We
            need to speak their language and what better way to bring startups to run on our platform.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Startups
            now on the accelerator program include Screemo, which is developing a cloud-based application to create
            low-cost advertising campaigns; and WCS Sports, a maker of a system to help owners of sports media rights to
            give fans personalized video clips and highlight preferred footage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There are so many
            things going on in the accelerator that can be exciting for the future,' Yaacovi said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shares
            Drop &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft stock fell as much as 5 percent in New York after Goldman Sachs Group
            Inc. said personal-computer market-share losses are accelerating and the company's push into consumer
            electronics hasn't gained traction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stock was down 4.7 percent at $28.85 as of 9:52
            a.m., paring its advance to 8 percent this year, compared with an 11 percent advance for the SP 500 index.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft released Windows 8 and the Surface tablet on Oct. 26 to appeal to consumers
            who are increasingly adopting mobile devices to surf the Internet, access e-mail and store pictures, music,
            documents and other information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Nadella Unveils Data-Analysis Tools</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella touted new products at an event in San
            Francisco for the third time in as many weeks, part of an effort to re-establish the software maker as an
            innovator. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, who took the top job in February, unveiled new tools and software
            for sifting through large amounts of data to identify trends and patterns at a meeting with developers today
            at the Bentley Reserve Building. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has been rolling out products for corporate
            clients that are seeking to manage Web-linked devices and crunch the information they generate. Nadella, who
            took the top job in February after leading the cloud and enterprise group, is working to remake Microsoft
            for an era where mobile gadgets have become central, corporations run software from remote servers and
            household electronics get more connected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The most imporant thing is to create a data
            culture,' Nadella said at the event. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analytics tools are in demand as a greater number
            of hardware devices, from personal-fitness monitors to thermostats to industrial equipment, connect to the
            Web, generating a sea of data. By 2020, the amount of information created may reach 5,247 gigabytes per
            person, according to Microsoft. That's twice as many bytes of data than liters of water in the world's
            oceans, the Redmond, Washington-based company said last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's yet another boost
            to the volume of data,' said Dan Vesset, an analyst at researcher IDC, referring to the surge in smart
            devices. 'That's another reason why they should be, and are, investing more in this space.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sorting
            Data &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Analytics Platform System is the latest of Microsoft's efforts to beef
            up its products for storing and sorting through all the information produced by connected devices, known as
            Big Data. On April 1, Microsoft released its SQL Server 2014 database software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I think
            Microsoft has an advantage in here,' Andrew Snodgrass, an analyst at researcher Directions on Microsoft,
            said in an interview. 'If you take a look at the databases out there, they are already Microsoft anyway.
            What they are saying is, they want companies to do more with their data, while they still are using its
            databases.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A number of technology companies -- Microsoft, Oracle Corp. (ORCL), and
            International Business Machines Corp. among them -- are competing in the Big Data market, which reached $13
            billion last year and will grow at a compounded annual rate of 27 percent through 2017, according to IDC.
            That includes software, hardware and services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Now we are into real investment,' Vesset
            said. 'There's more and more evidence that having this technology can make a difference from the competitive
            perspective, or increase productivity. There's demand out there.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Pledges to Match Amazon Prices on Cloud Computing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which is releasing
            new cloud-computing services today, said it will match
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)'s lowest prices for competing products as it
            seeks to win business in a growing market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is rolling out Windows Azure Infrastructure
            Services, which will let customers run existing applications on
            servers and storage machines in Microsoft data centers, after
            more than nine months of testing. The company also committed to
            match market leader Amazon on prices for computing and storage
            services, even if Amazon cuts rates, said Steven Martin, general
            manager of Windows Azure Business Strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seventy-one percent of respondents in a Forrester Research
            Inc. (FORR) survey said they used Amazon Web Services for cloud
            computing, compared with about 10 percent each for Microsoft,
            Google Inc. (GOOG) and other vendors. Revenue from public cloud
            services, which let customers run applications in an outside
            vendor's data center and access them via the Internet, jumped 20
            percent last year to $109 billion, Gartner Inc. estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world's largest
            software maker, has more than 200,000 customers for its Azure
            cloud products, and 1,000 new ones sign up daily, Martin said in
            an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 1 percent to $28.97 at the close in New
            York. The stock has advanced 8.5 percent this year, compared
            with a 10 percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s top mobile-phone executive said its Windows Phone operating system has an
            opportunity to lure away Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) users because it offers a more exciting
            and smoother experience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple's iOS software is 'boring,' with icons across the bottom
            that offer little information or flexibility, said Terry Myerson, vice president of the Windows Phone
            division, at a conference in New York. Google Inc.'s Android is 'a mess,' with too many different versions
            of the operating software in use, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is seeking to make inroads with
            Windows Phone to take advantage of rising demand for devices. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker
            had 2.6 percent of the smartphone operating system market in the fourth quarter, according to research firm
            IDC, up from 1.5 percent in the same period the prior year. That trailed Android's 70 percent, iOS's 21
            percent and BlackBerry's 3.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Myerson didn't provide a sales update for the
            Windows Phone, though he said he was proud of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), the company's main phone making partner.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said on Nov. 28 that sales jumped four
            times in the few weeks after the company released Windows Phone 8 at the end of October, compared with the
            same period in the previous year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), whose employees
            gave more money to President Barack Obama's re-election
            committee than those at any other company, was the second-
            largest donor to his January inauguration, contributing $2.1
            million, according to new Federal Election Commission filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the two parties gear up to battle for control
            of Congress in next year's election, the House and Senate
            fundraising committees for Democrats brought in more money than
            their Republican counterparts during 2013's first three months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Obama's inaugural committee raised more than $44 million,
            much of it from corporations in a reversal of his 2009 policy.
            The largest contributor to his 2013 swearing-in festivities was
            ATT Inc. (T), which gave $4.6 million. Boeing Co. (BA) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
            each donated $1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Obama's first inaugural committee raised more than $54
            million from individuals only. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other corporate donors to this year's committee included
            Genentech Inc., which gave $750,000; the Coca-Cola Co. (KO), which
            contributed $430,000; and Bank of America Corp., which donated
            $300,000. Bank of America also contributed $5 million to help

        <headline>Microsoft Rises as ValueAct Discloses $1.9 Billion Stake</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest software maker, rose the most in a year after activist
            investor ValueAct Holdings LP amassed about a $1.9 billion stake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares increased
            3.6 percent to $30.83 at the close in New York, the biggest gain since April 20, 2012 and the highest
            closing price since Sept. 21. The shares have advanced 15 percent this year, compared with a 9.6 percent
            gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer
            is working to deliver more software and services over the Internet to bolster sales amid a global PC slump
            that's eroding demand for pre-installed programs. ValueAct, which has a history of investing in companies it
            believes are fundamentally undervalued, said that Microsoft can succeed in this effort, aided by the Azure
            cloud-computing platform. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In three to five years, which is our time horizon, we'll stop
            talking about PC cycles and instead talk about Microsoft as the largest cloud-computing company in the
            world,' ValueAct CEO Jeffrey Ubben said today at a conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slideshow:
            Best and Worst Investments of 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement that its board
            and executives 'welcome the perspectives of shareholders.' The Redmond, Washington-based company also said
            it's committed to 'enhancing value for all shareholders.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft would become
            ValueAct's biggest holding, topping its $1.6 billion stake in Motorola Solutions Inc. as of Dec. 31,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. ValueAct manages more than $10 billion in assets, according to its
            website. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Top 20 &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ubben said ValueAct had almost 60 million shares,
            valued today at about $1.9 billion. That would put ValueAct among the top 20 biggest investors in Microsoft,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In March, industrial equipment maker Gardner
            Denver Inc. (GDI) agreed to sell itself to KKR Co. for about $3.7 billion after ValueAct became Gardner
            Denver's third-biggest shareholder and pressed for a deal. Another shareholder is now suing Gardner Denver
            saying the deal undervalues the company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They're value investors who don't mind being
            activists,' Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners, said in an interview. 'If things aren't working out,
            they would become more active.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ValueAct only plans to engage Microsoft's board over
            time if they're unhappy, CNBC reported earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>VirnetX Files Patent Suit Against Microsoft Over Skype</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;VirnetX Holding Corp. (VHC) which won a
            $200 million settlement from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) over patents
            related to private networks in 2010, filed a new lawsuit today
            claiming it's entitled to more money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VirnetX said Microsoft's Skype unit, which allows instant
            messaging and Internet calling, is infringing six patents.
            Skype, which Microsoft bought in October 2011 for $8.5 billion,
            wasn't part of that earlier deal, Zephyr Cove, Nevada-based
            VirnetX said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Although Microsoft previously signed a patent license
            with VirnetX, we believe they are infringing our patents in ways
            that are outside the scope of the original license,' Kendall Larsen, the company's chief executive officer,
            said in the
            statement. 'We look forward to quickly resolving this matter.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed in federal court in Tyler, Texas,
            where VirnetX has had mixed luck. One jury in November awarded
            VirnetX $368 million in a case against Apple Inc. (AAPL) over some of
            the same patents, while a different jury in March decided that
            Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) didn't infringe the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and VirnetX reached the
            earlier settlement after Microsoft lost a jury verdict against
            VirnetX. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Every successful technology company sees patent suits
            from time to time,' said David Cuddy, a Microsoft spokesman.
            'We're confident in our handling of intellectual property and
            look forward to addressing these claims.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Patent Licensing &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VirnetX, which relies on patent licensing for its income,
            reported $412,000 in revenue last year. The company, whose
            shares rise and fall with its litigation, rose 74 cents or 3.9
            percent, to $19.55 in New York trading. Its shares are down 33
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, reported
            $73.7 billion in sales in the last fiscal year. Microsoft rose
            3.6 percent to $30.83. Its stock is up 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new case is VirnetX Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 13-351,
            U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Trouble Building a Tech Startup in India? Call the Microsoft Hotline</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has offered tech support by phone for decades, from guiding business customers through a
            tricky Windows installation to making sure grandmas successfully locate Solitaire on the Start menu. But
            this month, the company launched a new kind of hotline in India to help entrepreneurs navigate the minefield
            of starting their own business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a novel move, Microsoft Ventures, the company's startup
            investment and accelerator arm, opened JumpStart, a toll-free number where support specialists will field
            calls from Indian entrepreneurs. Microsoft insists there are no restrictions on the type of questions an
            entrepreneur can ask, but expects its dedicated call center staff to be mostly advising customers on legal,
            funding or marketing issues. Microsoft says workers will walk callers through the processes of registering a
            company, preparing taxes, tracking down an accountant and finding a good lawyer. They're also happy to
            suggest technology solutions. (Microsoft Azure, perhaps?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, dial-in tech support
            seems old-fashioned to say the least, but Indians could use whatever help they can get. It's one of the
            toughest countries to start a business in, according to the World Bank. Part of that can be attributed to
            the 2012 "startup tax" that treats Indian investments as income, essentially penalizing companies that raise
            money locally. Amid complaints of over-regulation, last year was also the worst for Indian technology IPOs
            in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

            Indian participants take part in the "Windows AppFest," a marathon coding for 18 hours by more than 3,500
            software developers organised by Microsoft in Bangalore on Sept. 21, 2012. Microsoft Ventures has opened a
            call center with specialists who will field calls from Indian entrepreneurs seeking answers to business and
            technical questions. Close

        <headline>Microsoft Sends Invitations for May 21 Xbox Event</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans a 'special
            unveiling' related to the Xbox, suggesting that the world's
            biggest software maker use the event to introduce the latest
            version of its game console. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The event will be held at Microsoft's Redmond, Washington,
            headquarters, according to the e-mailed invitation. It will also
            be shown online, via the Xbox Live service and the Spike TV
            network. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The software maker is planning a new version of the console
            to maintain its 27-month lead over Sony Corp. (6758) and Nintendo Co.
            in a market projected to expand to $70 billion in 2017. It's
            also adding features to the Xbox designed to help it withstand
            the shift to games downloaded to computers and mobile devices
            from packaged products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will 'share our vision for Xbox and give you a
            real taste of the future,' Larry Hryb, the Director of Xbox
            Programming who goes by the name Major Nelson, on his official
            Xbox blog. He said Microsoft will will continue to discuss its
            plans and show its games lineup in May at the E3 show in Los
            Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will use an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) processor
            in the next Xbox game console, seeking to cut the cost of
            building machines and get developers to create more titles,
            people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this month.
            Xbox has led console sales in the U.S. for the last 27 months,
            according to market-research firm NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Competitor Consoles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sony unveiled the PlayStation 4, the newest version of its
            own console, in February and plans to release it in time for the
            holiday shopping season. Microsoft had considered holding its
            event in April and scrapped that plan, people familiar with the
            matter said earlier this month. The company saw little
            competitive pressure from Sony's announcement, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nintendo's Wii U, another competitor, has been selling
            below the company's initial forecasts. In January, the company
            said it expected to sell 4 million units in the fiscal year
            ending March 31, down from a previous outlook for 5.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Traditional console makers face competition from cheaper
            machines like Ouya Inc.'s online gaming device, and changes in
            game play that favor inexpensive titles for mobile devices such
            as Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPads and Samsung's Galaxy Tab. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. retail sales of packaged video games fell 21 percent
            last year to $8.9 billion, according to researcher NPD Group,
            while revenue from games downloaded to computers and mobile
            devices rose 16 percent to $5.9 billion. Globally, the market
            including hardware and accessories was $67 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Sells $2.67 Billion of Bonds With Record Euro Coupon</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), one of four U.S.
            companies with a top credit rating from Standard Poor's and
            Moody's Investors Service, sold $2.67 billion of bonds with a
            portion of euro-denominated debt paying a record-low coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker issued bonds in euros
            for the first time, raising 550 million euros ($715 million)
            with 20-year, 2.625 percent notes, the lowest coupon among
            similar-maturity, non-financial corporate bonds sold in that
            currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt pays
            55 basis points more than swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the company also sold $450 million of 1
            percent, five-year securities that pay 32 basis points more than
            Treasuries, $1 billion of 2.375 percent, 10-year notes that
            yield an extra 70 basis points and $500 million of 3.75 percent,
            30-year bonds that pay a spread of 90. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used to fund working capital, stock
            repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment, Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft said today in separate filings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The debt is opportunistic and helps us lower the overall
            cost of capital,' said Peter Wootton, a spokesman for
            Microsoft. The pricing 'in Europe is very attractive in this
            20-year tenor.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's $14.3 billion of outstanding bonds before
            today's sale include $750 million of 2.125 percent notes due
            November 2022 that traded at 98.5 cents on the dollar April 23
            to yield 2.3 percent, or 60.2 basis points more than Treasuries,
            according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
            Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While average yields on investment-grade corporate debt
            have dropped 8 basis points to 2.69 percent since Microsoft last
            issued bonds in November, the company's new dollar securities
            were priced with higher coupons than those in the previous
            offering, according to Bloomberg and Bank of America Merrill
            Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, along with Johnson Johnson, Exxon Mobil Corp.
            and Automatic Data Processing Inc., are rated Aaa by Moody's and
            AAA at SP. Fitch Ratings ranks the company a level lower at
            AA+. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world's
            largest software maker, sold bonds in euros for the first time,
            joining LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) and Nestle (NESN) SA in
            taking advantage of record-low borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft raised 550 million euros ($719 million) from 20-
            year notes, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
            French luxury goods maker LVMH is marketing its first euro bonds
            in two years, while Nestle, the world's biggest food company,
            sold its first securities in the currency since October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's the busiest day in six weeks for issuance in Europe,
            as non-financial companies sell 3.9 billion euros of bonds,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average yield
            investors demand to hold investment-grade corporate bonds in the
            single currency has fallen to a record 1.84 percent, Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'People are desperate for yield and there is not much to
            find in the government market so they will jump into corporate
            bonds,' said Thomas Kristiansson, head of credit fixed income
            at SEB AB in Stockholm. 'These deals are coming tight.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft (MSFT)'s deal was priced to yield 55 basis points more
            than swaps. The Redmond, Washington-based company is also
            selling five-, 10- and 30-year bonds denominated in dollars,
            according to the person, who asked not to be identified because
            the details are private. Its the company's first dollar sale
            since November. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Completes Nokia Phone-Unit Deal in Push to Mobile</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) completed the
            takeover of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s phone business, ending a seven-month
            wait to renew its assault on the mobile market and leaving the
            Finnish company seeking growth in wireless networks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The final price may be 'slightly higher' than the 5.44
            billion euros ($7.5 billion) announced in September, Nokia said
            today. About 30,000 employees are transferring to Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft as part of the transaction, which was
            delayed amid regulatory scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is gaining a
            device business that it'll rely on to catch up with Apple Inc. (AAPL)
            and Google Inc. (GOOG) in the tablet and mobile-phone markets. Nokia is
            left seeking a turnaround for its network-equipment business and
            is said to consider the division's head, Rajeev Suri, as chief
            executive officer to challenge rivals such as Ericsson (ERICB) AB. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The deal alone doesn't immediately solve the problem for
            either company,' said Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea Bank
            AB in Helsinki. 'Now, they have to roll up their sleeves and
            starting working to play catch-up.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The purchase of the unprofitable division makes Microsoft
            the world's second-largest maker of mobile phones with about 14
            percent of the market, according to researcher IDC. Samsung
            Electronics Co. is the market leader. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Motorola Mobility unit isn't entitled to the potentially billions of dollars
            it sought for its patents on technology used throughout the electronics community, a federal judge ruled in
            a victory for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft should pay about a half-cent per unit for
            video- decoding technology and 3 1/2 cents for wireless technology, U.S. District Judge James Robart in
            Seattle said in a decision made public yesterday. That equals about $1.8 million a year, Microsoft said, far
            less than the 2.25 percent of the retail price on Microsoft products Motorola Mobility initially demanded.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ruling marks a rare instance in which a U.S. court has set guidelines on how patent
            owners should value inventions on industrywide standards developed so devices running on different platforms
            can work together. Participants in these groups promise to license patents on 'fair, reasonable and non-
            discriminatory' terms, an issue that has prompted inquiries by antitrust regulators on three continents
            involving companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and InterDigital Inc. (IDCC) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'People
            are not going to stop participating in standardization because of this -- it's too important to the market,'
            said Jorge Contreras, an associate law professor at American University in Washington. He said the ruling
            will help bring some 'disputes to a speedier close, potentially.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Standards Patents
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies meet to develop standards so, for instance, data can be sent to any
            smartphone no matter the manufacturer, or a video sent from one type of device can be watched on another.
            Companies that help establish the criteria gain an advantage in having their technology included in
            standards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This decision is good for consumers because it ensures patented technology
            committed to standards remains affordable for everyone,' David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft,
            said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next step in the case is a trial in August to determine
            whether, based on the ranges set by Robart, Motorola Mobility met its contractual obligation to license its
            patents on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Motorola has licensed its substantial patent portfolio on
            reasonable rates consistent with those set by others in the industry,' Matt Kallman, a spokesman for
            Motorola Mobility, said in a statement after the ruling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the factors that must be
            considered, Robart decided, is what would be the total rate charged to manufacturers when added to amounts
            paid to other patent owners on the standard, and whether that would meet the goal of ensuring a standard
            gets wide acceptance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Public Interest &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He acknowledges the public
            interest aspect of these calculations,' Contreras said. 'It's not just two companies going to a back room
            and coming up with whatever they want to.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The judge also considered how valuable the
            patents are to the standard, and how valuable the standard is to the products involved in the dispute, the
            professor said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robart said the proper royalty range for the video-decoding technology,
            used in both the Xbox video-gaming system and Windows operating system, should be no more than 16.4 cents
            per unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility's portfolio 'only constitutes a sliver of the overall
            technology incorporated' into the standard, Robart said in his 207-page opinion. For the Wi-Fi portfolio,
            applicable to the Xbox, the upper rate would be 19.5 cents per unit, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dispute's
            Origins &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dispute between Microsoft and Motorola Mobility, then a standalone company,
            began in 2010, when Redmond, Washington- based Microsoft demanded that Motorola Mobility pay patent
            royalties on its mobile phones that run on Google's Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola
            Mobility, which helped establish standards for technologies such as video decoding and Wi-Fi, responded by
            demanding that Microsoft pay royalties on the Windows operating system and Xbox. It sent letters in October
            2010, demanding 2.25 percent on the retail price of the products. Microsoft, which reported $73.7 billion in
            2012 revenue, has said the royalties would total more than $4 billion a year, a figure Motorola Mobility
            disputes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At trial, Robart's decision says, Motorola Mobility's expert testified that,
            when possible cross-licensing deals were taken into account, Microsoft would pay $36 million to $54 million
            in fiscal 2011, or a per unit rate of as much as $4.50 for the Wi-Fi technology in each Xbox. For the
            video-decoding patent, Motorola Mobility's expert said the net payment would cap at no more than $125
            million a year, or as much as 63 cents a unit, according to Robart's decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Patent
            Pools &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Motorola Mobility focused on the possible outcome of negotiations between
            the two companies, Microsoft urged the judge to compare the rate charged by patent pools, in which a large
            number of companies get together and establish a single licensing rate for everyone. Robart mostly sided
            with Microsoft on this issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft had argued that, based on the different pools
            for those two standards patents, the proper royalty rate would be pennies per product, with the royalties on
            the standard for video compression totaling no more than $521,000 a year. It also contended the rate for
            wireless technology should be based on what it calls the smallest salable unit, meaning the Marvell
            Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) chips, which cost about $3. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Xbox Demand &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            argued the games -- not wireless technology -- drive demand for the Xbox. Motorola Mobility contended sales
            of the device fell when Microsoft failed to include Wi-Fi before 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility
            said it had originally charged licensees a flat rate of $9 per unit, and converted that to the 2.25 percent
            royalty at the request of companies that said falling phone prices were pushing the rate up. It said
            Microsoft refused to make a counteroffer, instead filing the breach-of-contract suit on which Robart ruled.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) made similar breach-of-contract allegations against Motorola Mobility
            in a case in federal court in Wisconsin. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb threw out the case last year
            after Apple said it wouldn't abide by any royalty rate she set. Apple has filed an appeal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google,
            which bought Motorola Mobility last year, reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that
            it wouldn't seek to block sales of products that comply with industry standards. European regulators also
            are investigating Google's use of the Motorola Mobility patents in litigation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The case
            suit is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Motorola Mobility Inc., 10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the Western
            District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Google to Microsoft's New Import May Be Cyber Standards</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Efforts by Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft
            Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to be excluded from U.S. cybersecurity
            rules may become moot under a European Commission proposal that
            could force them to report attacks and make their products more
            secure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;E-mail providers, search engines, social networking
            websites and companies specializing in electronic commerce would
            have to comply with cybersecurity requirements to sell products
            and services within the 27 countries of the European Union under
            a directive proposed Feb. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama's administration exempted products
            like Google's Gmail, Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPhone software and
            Microsoft's Windows operating system from a February executive
            order aimed at improving cybersecurity in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Some EU member states may enact stricter standards than
            what the EU as a whole requires,' said Sanford Reback, director
            of global business for Bloomberg Government, which released a
            study today on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Some U.S. companies may decide to comply with the
            strictest EU standard adopted rather than have the operational
            headache of trying to fine-tune their cybersecurity measures for
            different markets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Internet companies that successfully fought to be excluded
            from Obama's cybersecurity order aren't giving in without a
            fight in Europe. The European directive is 'very challenging,'
            Paul Nicholas, a senior director for Microsoft (MSFT), said in a phone
            interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is lobbying European governments and plans to
            convene a cybersecurity summit in June to discuss the issue, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Company Lobbying &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'When you create these types of specific requirements
            country by country it tends to discourage people from building
            global products and services,' Nicholas said. 'Over time, that
            can erode innovation and it also limits economic opportunities.
            It reduces the number of markets that you can participate in.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and European governments are advancing
            cybersecurity policies to prevent electronic attacks from
            disrupting banks, utilities, telecommunications networks and
            financial services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Internet companies lobbied the White House to carve out an
            exception for them when developing the executive order. The
            Internet Association, a trade group whose members include
            Google, Facebook Inc. and Amazon urged the White House and
            Congress to 'ensure that all Internet services are not subject
            to regulation,' the group's president, Michael Beckerman, said
            in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Competing Approaches &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission's approach 'seems overly
            proscriptive,' said David LeDuc, senior director for public
            policy at the Software Information Industry Association in
            Washington, which represents major companies like Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
            International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These types of policies would be exactly what you would
            implement if you were trying to stifle innovation,' LeDuc said
            in a phone interview. 'It makes tons of sense in theory but
            it's a lot harder than it actually sounds.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The threat of cyberattacks has become a greater concern
            than terrorism, James Clapper, the top U.S. intelligence
            official, told the House Intelligence Committee during an April
            11 hearing. An April 23 hacking attack on the Associated Press'
            Twitter Inc. account that erroneously said there were explosions
            at the White House caused the Standard Poor's 500 Index to
            briefly lose $136 billion in market value before recovering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Improving Security &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Europe has had its share of cyber crime, too. The Czech
            Republic's central bank said its website was temporarily knocked
            offline March 6, and the European Commission cited a report that
            the London Stock Exchange experienced a serious cyber attack in
            2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission proposal includes Internet
            companies 'because it is absurd to work to protect critical
            Internet infrastructure without obliging such companies to take
            responsibility for their wider role in this ecosystem,' the
            commission said in a Feb. 7 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Internet and technology companies would face security
            requirements under the proposed directive because they provide
            services and products vital to governments and the economy, and
            are often targeted by hackers, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;LeDuc said companies believe the security standards will
            constantly change, leading to uncertainty. 'It takes quite
            awhile to go through a process and identify what those standards
            are,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Negotiations Continue &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google is watching the process in the European Commission
            and hasn't taken a formal position on its proposed directive, a
            spokeswoman, Samantha Smith, said in an e-mail. Calls to Amazon
            weren't returned. Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The directive will be vetted by European governments in the
            coming months, James Lewis, technology program director at the
            Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
            said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The chance for these things to fall off the rails is
            always high,' Lewis said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Debate over how to improve cybersecurity also continues in
            the U.S. Telecommunication companies like Verizon Communications
            Inc. (VZ) have questioned why the Obama administration didn't include
            information technology products and consumer information
            services as critical U.S. infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Obama's order 'is not about Netflix, Twitter, Facebook,
            and Snapchat,' White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said in
            an e-mail at the time. It's aimed at power grids,
            telecommunications, pipelines and other vital infrastructure
            whose incapacitation from a cyber attack would have national
            security and economic implications, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If e-mail went away this afternoon, we would all come to
            a stop,' said Marcus Sachs, vice president of national security
            policy at Verizon, the second-largest U.S. phone company. 'Hell
            yeah, e-mail is critical.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Wins Antitrust Case as Top Court Rejects Novell</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court ended a
            lawsuit that accused Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) of illegally protecting its
            Windows computer operating system from competition 20 years ago
            by undercutting a rival word-processing program. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Declining to take up a lingering antitrust case stemming
            from Microsoft's software dominance in the 1990s, the justices
            today rejected without comment an appeal by Novell Inc., which
            once made the WordPerfect application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novell was looking to revive a lawsuit that accused
            Microsoft of anticompetitive conduct during development of its
            Windows 95 operating system in 1994. Novell said that, late in
            the rollout process, Microsoft withheld software components
            known as namespace extensions so competing developers would have
            trouble making their programs run smoothly on Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novell said the move slowed the development of WordPerfect,
            a word-processing program that posed a threat to Microsoft's
            Word. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In throwing out the lawsuit, a Denver-based federal appeals
            court said 'antitrust laws rarely impose on firms -- even
            dominant firms -- a duty to deal with their rivals.' The ruling
            upheld a federal trial judge's opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Novell, now part of privately held Wizard Parent LLC,
            argued in its appeal that Microsoft 'made its own operating
            system less attractive to consumers in order to crush
            competition and protect its operating system monopoly.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case bore some similarities to the 1998 Justice
            Department lawsuit that at one point produced a court order that
            would have split Microsoft into two companies. An appeals court
            overturned that order, and the company later settled the case by
            agreeing to let computer makers promote rival software products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts didn't take part in the Supreme
            Court action. He was involved as a lawyer in the Justice
            Department's antitrust case against Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Novell v. Microsoft, 13-1042. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Rushes to Fix Security Flaw in Explorer Browser</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is rushing to fix a
            security flaw in its Internet Explorer browser that is already
            being used in 'limited, targeted attacks,' as antivirus firms
            and the U.S. government advise switching to alternate products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To take over a user's personal computer through the
            browser's vulnerability, a hacker would have to persuade that
            person to click on a link to view a malicious website, Microsoft
            said in an advisory. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Explorer security concerns come just weeks after the
            public discovery of Heartbleed, a flaw in the design of an
            encryption tool that runs on as many as two-thirds of all active
            websites. Some edition of Internet Explorer runs on 58 percent
            of all desktop PCs, according NetMarketShare, compared with 18
            percent for Google Inc.'s Chrome, the No. 2 browser. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
            could gain the same user rights as the current user,' Microsoft
            said in the advisory, issued on April 26. 'On completion of
            this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action
            to protect our customers, which may include providing a solution
            through our monthly security update release process, or an out-of-cycle security update, depending on
            customer needs.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Windows XP &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The flaw exists in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11,
            which means it will affect users of Windows XP, the operating
            system that Microsoft stopped supporting with security updates
            earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Symantec Corp., the biggest maker of PC-security software,
            advised customers to switch to another browser until Microsoft
            releases a software patch to fix the vulnerability and to use a
            security mitigation tool kit that Microsoft recommended and that
            will work with Windows XP. The U.S. Department of Homeland
            Security's Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued similar
            advice today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The vulnerability was found on April 26 by researchers at
            security firm FireEye Inc. (FEYE), who also discovered the related
            attacks and named the campaign 'Operation Clandestine Fox.'
            FireEye, in a statement on its blog, declined to provide details
            of the campaign except to say that it was targeted at Internet
            Explorer versions 9 through 11, which account for about a
            quarter of the total browser market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Zero-Day Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This type of security flaw is known as a zero-day threat
            because there is no time between the discovery of the weakness
            and attacks attempting to exploit it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, researchers disclosed discovery of the
            Heartbleed bug, a flaw in OpenSSL encryption software.
            Researchers pushed out a fix for the vulnerability, which could
            have enabled hackers to gain access to user names, passwords and
            other sensitive information, and users were urged to change
            their website passwords. Companies such as BlackBerry Ltd.,
            Cisco Systems Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. were affected by the bug. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer-data breaches at Target Corp. and Neiman Marcus
            Group Ltd. in recent months and the spying scandal involving the
            National Security Agency have also raised concerns about the
            security of networks and private information. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Azure Sales Top $1 Billion Challenging Amazon</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects spelling of company name in 22nd paragraph.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s
            Windows Azure software and related programs have surpassed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time, a
            sign of progress in the effort to challenge Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            sales milestone for Azure -- which stores business information and programs on remote servers and lets
            customers access them over the Web -- was reached in the past 12 months, said Curt Anderson, finance chief
            for Microsoft's server and tools unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, is
            counting on Azure and other Internet-based business programs to bolster growth as a global personal-computer
            slump erodes demand for Windows software installed on desktop machines. About 20 percent of companies
            tapping the cloud use Azure, compared with 71 percent usage for Amazon, according to James Staten, an
            analyst at Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) Within a year, Microsoft can command as much as 35 percent, he
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I expect them to double annually from here,' Staten said of Microsoft's Azure
            revenue. 'Microsoft probably has more net new growth opportunity sitting in front of them than probably
            anyone in the market.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's $1 billion sales figure includes Azure, as well as
            software provided to partners to create related Windows cloud services, Anderson said in an interview. Azure
            customers use the services to run corporate programs, websites and applications from Microsoft's data
            centers, rather than spending on their own servers, storage machines and workers to maintain them. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            With the latest offering, Microsoft entered a niche known as Infrastructure as a Service, which lets
            companies move applications to the cloud by renting storage and servers -- instead of older versions of
            Azure that required customers to write programs from scratch. Close

        <headline>Microsoft Pays Higher Rate to Beat Apple Sale: Corporate Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is paying higher
            yields on new bonds than in a November sale after it beat the
            planned return of Apple Inc. (AAPL) to the credit market after an
            absence of almost two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, one of four U.S.-based businesses with the
            highest ratings from Moody's Investors Service and Standard
            Poor's, issued $1.95 billion of dollar-denominated debt last
            week with a weighted average coupon of 2.41 percent, exceeding
            the 2.33 percent for similar bonds it sold five months earlier
            even with interest rates at about the same level. The latest
            sale came two days after Apple said it would use debt to help
            fund a $55 billion addition to a plan to return cash to
            shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft paid a little more than they otherwise would,
            given the looming Apple issuance,' said Noel Hebert, the chief
            investment officer at Concannon Wealth Management, which
            oversees about $250 million of assets from Bethlehem,
            Pennsylvania. 'The higher coupons are likely a fair trade to
            get in front of the new Apple paper, which will have to get
            digested.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the world's largest software maker has a higher
            credit rating than Apple, growth at the Redmond, Washington-
            based company has stagnated for more than a decade. After
            generating enough free cash flow in 1999 to buy Apple twice
            over, Microsoft's $27.5 billion of funds earned in the last 12
            months now accounts for about 60 percent of the amount produced
            by its Cupertino, California-based competitor. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Xbox One Console Rolls Out in China in Fall</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will begin selling its Xbox One video-game console in China in September
            after a 13-year ban on such equipment was lifted in January. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The device will be sold
            through Microsoft's partnership with BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a unit of Shanghai Media Group Inc., the
            company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Microsoft didn't provide details on game titles for the
            Chinese market, except to say the venture will invest 'to establish an innovation program that will enable
            creators and developers to build, publish, and sell their games on Xbox One in China.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China's
            video-game industry will generate about $10 billion in sales next year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers
            LLP, and the rule change has set off a flurry of activity. TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings Ltd. said this
            month it will make a game player, and ZTE Corp. announced plans for its Fun Box in March. Sony Corp. and
            Nintendo Co. are also weighing Chinese entries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'China took over as the No. 1 consumer
            of TVs in the world ahead of the U.S. last year,' said P.J. McNealy, analyst and CEO at Digital World
            Research in Natick, Massachusetts. 'Having an entertainment console attached to follow those coattails makes
            a lot of sense.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To succeed, Microsoft will have to lower the Xbox One's $499 price for
            the Chinese market and line up game titles between now and September, McNealy said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft's
            Challenges &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Hands down the two biggest challenges for Microsoft are content and
            pricing,' he said. 'Right now they don't have a clear value proposition of what content they are going to
            sell on the gaming front, the music front, the TV front or the movie front.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            formed the $79 million venture with BesTV in September to enter the Chinese market. Microsoft will make an
            official announcement tomorrow in China about the Xbox debut. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consoles such as the Xbox,
            Nintendo's Wii U and Sony's PlayStation were banned under a 2000 rule to protect youths from the perceived
            corrupting influence of video games. China announced last year that the ban would be lifted within the
            Shanghai free-trade zone, which opened in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January, China's ruling State
            Council temporarily suspended the ban for the entire country and said it will draft new rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BesTV invested $40.3 million for a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, while Microsoft put in
            $38.7 million for the rest, according a September filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox One, which went on
            sale in November, has been outgunned in U.S. sales by Sony's PlayStation 4 for three consecutive months,
            according to market research firm NPD Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sales of the $399 PlayStation 4, also
            released in November, have surpassed 7 million units worldwide through April 6, Sony said in an April 16
            statement. Microsoft has sold more than 5 million of its $499 Xbox One units, according to an April 17 blog
            posting on its Xbox site. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Sues Samsung Over Patent Licensing Agreement</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. sued Samsung
            Electronics Co. (005930), claiming the South Korean smartphone maker
            breached a 2011 agreement to share patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, the two companies cross-licensed
            patents for each other's products. Microsoft, the world's
            biggest software maker, got royalties from Samsung for phones
            and tablets that use some of the U.S. company's patented
            technology. The two companies said they would work together to
            develop and market Windows Phone, Microsoft's mobile software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The software giant claimed, in a heavily redacted complaint
            filed today in Manhattan federal court, that Samsung is using
            Microsoft's April acquisition of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s phone business as
            an excuse to stop complying with the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Samsung failed to make a royalty payment on
            time and refused to pay interest on the late payment. The
            Redmond, Washington-based company claimed Samsung is threatening
            to breach the license agreement again because of the Nokia
            acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't take lightly filing a legal action, especially
            against a company with which we've enjoyed a long and productive
            partnership,' David Howard, Microsoft's deputy general counsel,
            said today in a company blog. 'After spending months trying to
            resolve our disagreement, Samsung has made clear in a series of
            letters and discussions that we have a fundamental disagreement
            as to the meaning of our contract.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google Asks Judge to Toss Microsoft Suit Over Phone Ban</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) said Microsoft (MSFT) Corp.
            acted too hastily in suing U.S. customs officials in a patent
            dispute over whether Motorola Mobility phones should be blocked
            at the border. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google, in a court filing today, asked a federal judge to
            throw out a lawsuit brought by Microsoft that accused the U.S.
            Customs and Border Protection of failing to enforce an order to
            ban imports of the phones. Microsoft should instead have taken
            its complaint back to the trade agency that issued the ban,
            Google argued. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft won an order from the International Trade
            Commission that prevents Google's Motorola Mobility from
            shipping Asian-made phones that have a feature that synchronizes
            calendars between phones and computers. Google convinced customs
            that it was no longer infringing the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's suit is 'an unprecedented attempt' by
            Microsoft to circumvent the administrative process, Google said,
            seeking to intervene in the case. 'Customs noted that the ITC
            has yet to consider, much less resolve, the issue Microsoft asks
            this court to decide: whether Motorola's use of Google's
            synchronization protocol infringes Microsoft's patent.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ITC in Washington issued the ban in May 2012 after
            deciding that Motorola Mobility devices infringed the Microsoft
            patent. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, in a complaint
            filed July 12, said that order isn't being enforced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Google Appeal &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, is appealing
            the infringement finding, while Microsoft is challenging the
            ITC's decision that four other patents weren't infringed. The
            U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes
            in patent law, is scheduled to hear arguments in both appeals
            Aug. 6 in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a filing today, the U.S. asked the court to deny
            Microsoft's request, arguing the company 'entirely fails to
            establish entitlement to the extraordinary remedy of compelling
            government to action.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Cuddy, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment
            immediately on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Department of Homeland
            Security, 13-1063, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
            (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Names Johnson Head of Business Development</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) named Qualcomm Inc.
            executive Peggy Johnson to be head of business development, as
            Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella continues to shift the
            software company's management ranks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Johnson served as executive vice president of Qualcomm
            Technologies and president of global market development. At
            Microsoft, she will oversee business deals and partnerships with
            important customers, equipment makers and publishers, the
            company said in a statement today. Johnson replaces Tony Bates,
            who left in March when Nadella shuffled management just weeks
            after taking on the CEO role. Johnson joins Nadella's senior
            leadership team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The business development role is a key one at Microsoft.
            The Redmond, Washington-based company needs to smooth over
            relationships with existing hardware partners and recruit new
            ones as it integrates Nokia Oyj's handset unit and copes with
            the poor adoption of its Windows operating system on handsets
            and tablets. Nadella is also ramping up efforts to offer
            Microsoft's applications and services on rival operating systems
            and is trying to work more closely with rivals like
            Salesforce.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since Bates left, Microsoft Executive Vice President for
            Advanced Strategy Eric Rudder had been overseeing business
            development on an interim basis. Rudder will focus on technology
            initiatives for devices and services across the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Johnson, who will start Sept. 1, has a degree in electrical
            engineering and spent 24 years at Qualcomm. She oversaw both the
            company's global marketing organization and its Qualcomm Labs
            incubator. According to her new Microsoft bio, she 'will be
            relocating to the Seattle area with her husband and youngest of
            three children, four dogs and one goldfish.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bates, who was passed over for the CEO job, has since
            joined wearable-camera maker GoPro Inc. as president. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Former Microsoft Manager Gets Two Years for Insider Trading</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) senior manager
            Brian Jorgenson was sentenced to two years in prison for insider
            trading that reaped $400,000 in profit using nonpublic
            information about the software maker's quarterly earnings and
            its investment in Barnes Noble Inc. (BKS), the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A manager in Microsoft's corporate finance and investment
            division earning a six-figure salary, Jorgenson, 32, was privy
            to confidential information about planned acquisitions when he
            tipped friend Sean Stokke about the Barnes Noble investment in
            2012, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two used Jorgenson's access to confidential information
            twice more in 2013, placing bets before Microsoft's quarterly
            earnings announcements, before they were stopped by law
            enforcement. The pair tried to hide their moves with disposable
            'burner phones' and by passing payouts in $10,000 cash
            increments, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a
            related lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I cheated. I tried to take a shortcut for my own
            financial gain,' Jorgenson said at his sentencing hearing today
            in federal court in Seattle, according to a statement by U.S.
            Attorney Jenny Durkan. 'I persuaded myself it was a gray area,
            when it clearly was black and white.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jorgenson, of Lynwood, Washington, pleaded guilty earlier
            this year to one count of securities fraud. Stokke, 28, of
            Seattle, was sentenced last month to 18 months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Angelo Calfo, Jorgenson's attorney, didn't immediately
            respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment on the
            sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Jorgenson, 14-cr-00120, U.S. District
            Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;InterDigital Inc. (IDCC) lost its patent
            case against Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) and ZTE Corp. at the U.S. International
            Trade Commission, dealing the phone-chip researcher another blow
            in its efforts to create a new royalty stream. InterDigital
            pledged to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia phones, now made by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), and devices by
            ZTE didn't violate InterDigital patent rights, the ITC said in a
            notice today on its website. The commission upheld, with
            modifications, June findings from a trade judge who said that
            Nokia didn't infringe one patent and that ZTE didn't infringe
            that patent or two others. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case -- InterDigital's third at the ITC -- is part of a
            years-long struggle to get royalties on sales of the newest
            generations of mobile phones. InterDigital got almost all of its
            $325 million in sales last year from patent licensing with
            companies such as BlackBerry Ltd. and HTC Corp. Nokia and ZTE
            have held out, denying they owe any money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2006, Espoo, Finland-based Nokia agreed to pay
            InterDigital $253 million to end a licensing dispute over
            earlier phone technology. A year later, InterDigital filed suit
            again over technology not covered by the earlier agreement, and
            the companies haven't been able to reach an agreement since. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The commission's decision is disappointing, running
            contrary to a number of judicial decisions involving, in some
            instances, the exact same patents as in this case,'
            InterDigital Chief Executive Officer William Merritt said in a
            statement. 'We do not feel this decision will have any
            meaningful impact on our progress towards our licensing goals.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Purchase &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ITC has been the locus of the fight, because the trade
            agency has the power to block imports of products made overseas
            that violate U.S. intellectual property rights. The first ITC
            case, which InterDigital lost, was revived on appeal and is
            scheduled for a new hearing in January. The Wilmington,
            Delaware-based company lost a second case in December, which is
            on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft bought Nokia's handset business in April and has
            told the agency it agreed to assume all of Nokia's liabilities
            and have 'sole control over the defense, including sole
            authority to resolve this action.' Even so, Nokia remains in
            the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia was accused of infringing a patent for a method to
            improve transmissions. ZTE was accused of infringing that patent
            as well as two others for mobile-phone technology. ITC Judge
            Theodore Essex found that the three patents weren't infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fair Terms &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Separately, the judge ruled that InterDigital hadn't
            fulfilled the requirement of a market in the U.S. for the
            patents because there wasn't a link between the three patents
            and any product. The agency's job is to protect U.S. markets
            from unfair trade practices, so patent owners must prove they
            have a domestic industry to defend. The commission upheld Essex
            on that point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He did find that InterDigital hadn't violated its pledge to
            license the patents on fair terms, and said that, in some
            instances, it's the company making the products that's being
            unreasonable in licensing talks. The commission took no position
            on that part of the judge's findings, saying the issue of
            patents on standardized technology will be considered in the
            other case against Nokia that InterDigital has pending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'InterDigital is trying to block our products based on
            patents it openly promised the industry could use at reasonable
            rates,' David Cuddy, a Microsoft spokesman, said in a
            statement. 'We're grateful the commission has now confirmed
            that we don't even use these patents in our products.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Senators' Letters &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Officials with InterDigital didn't immediately respond to a
            query seeking comment after normal business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind the commission's decision will be
            available after both sides have a chance to redact confidential
            information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Essex recommended that should a violation of InterDigital's
            patent rights be found, the agency issue an import ban and delay
            the implementation for six months to limit the effect on
            consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Senators Robert Casey, a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a
            Republican, both representing Pennsylvania, separately wrote to
            the agency last month on InterDigital's behalf. The company was
            formerly based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, and some of its
            almost 300 workers are still in the state. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Their business model and the future success of their
            workers are based on the licenses paid for their innovations
            used by equipment manufacturers,' Toomey wrote. Allowing
            companies to infringe patents without paying 'will only deter
            companies like InterDigital from taking bets on future research
            and development. That cannot be good for American innovation and
            job creation.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Certain Wireless Devices with
            3G and/or 4G Capabilities, 337-868, U.S. International Trade
            Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Steve Ballmer Exits Microsoft's Board After Departure as CEO</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer resigned from
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s board, eight months after his departure as
            chief executive officer, ending more than three decades of
            direct involvement in the world's largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 58, remains Microsoft's top individual
            shareholder. He had initially remained as a director after
            handing the top job over to one of his deputies, Satya Nadella,
            in February. Ballmer recently bought the Los Angeles Clippers
            for $2 billion and appeared in front of the team and fans this
            week, vowing to lift the team to 'higher heights' and
            promising not to micromanage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former CEO's departure ends a 34-year association with
            Microsoft, which he led as CEO from 2000 to February 2014.
            Revenue tripled under Ballmer's tenure, even as the Redmond,
            Washington-based company struggled to compete with Apple Inc.
            and Google Inc. in areas such as mobile phones, tablet computers
            and Internet search. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I want to be a great shareholder and I want to pay
            appropriate attention to my shares but between teaching classes
            and my new responsibilities at the Clippers and my civic duties,
            it's a lot,' Ballmer said in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former CEO, who dropped out of Stanford University's
            business school in 1980 to become Microsoft's 30th employee,
            will return to the graduate school this fall to teach a course
            in strategic management, and also teach a class at the
            University of Southern California next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Board Changes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer's exit is the latest change to Microsoft's board.
            Last month, Microsoft named longtime wireless executive John Stanton to the board. In March, director Steve
            Luczo stepped
            down and in February, co-founder Bill Gates stepped aside as
            chairman to be replaced by lead independent director John Thompson. The board also added activist investor
            Mason Morfit of
            ValueAct Holdings LP to its ranks this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a letter to Nadella that was posted on Microsoft's
            website yesterday, Ballmer wrote that he would 'support and
            encourage boldness by management in my role as a shareholder in
            any way I can.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nadella thanked Ballmer, who took over for Gates as CEO in
            2000, for his years at the company, saying that the former CEO
            created an 'incredible foundation that we continue to build
            on.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities
            LLC, said Ballmer's exit from the board creates room for Nadella
            to put more of his stamp on Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I think he recognizes that it's very hard for a new CEO
            to take the reins and have full authority with the old CEO on
            the board,' Barnicle said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Largest Holder &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer became the company's biggest individual shareholder
            in May after Gates sold 4.6 million shares of Microsoft. Ballmer
            owns 333.3 million shares of Microsoft, 3.48 million more than
            Gates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ballmer has
            collected about $3.4 billion selling shares since the company's
            1986 initial public offering, and has a net worth of $20.8
            billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer paid about four times what anyone's ever paid for
            an NBA team when he bought the Clippers. His chance came when
            fans and the NBA soured on previous owner Donald Sterling, who
            was banned for life and fined $2.5 million after a tape of him
            making racially derogatory comments was made public. Sterling's
            wife, Shelly Sterling, went to court to compel him to sell the
            franchise he purchased in 1981 for $12.5 million, and Ballmer's
            acquisition became official last week. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Leaves Lobbying Group ALEC Amid Split Over Renewables</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg BNA -- Microsoft Corp. has left the American Legislative Exchange Council because of
            concerns about the lobbying group's opposition to renewable energy, a coalition of activist investor groups
            said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sustainability Group and Walden Asset Management, asset management companies
            that describe themselves as focused on sustainable investing, said Microsoft confirmed in e-mails that it's
            no longer a part of ALEC after the groups pressed the company to abandon it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Microsoft is
            a leader on carbon issues'in 2012, it committed to becoming carbon neutral, and is one of the largest
            corporate purchasers of renewable energy,' the Boston-based groups said in a news release. 'Thus, we believe
            that its affiliation with ALEC, which is actively fighting policies that promote renewable energy, was
            incongruous. In addition, there were numerous other ALEC actions that conflicted directly with Microsoft's
            values.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arlington, Va.-based ALEC has drafted model legislation for use in state
            legislatures to roll back renewable fuel standards across the country. Its members include ExxonMobil Corp.,
            Peabody Energy Inc., American Electric Power Co. and Koch Industries Inc., according to the Checks and
            Balances Project, a nonprofit watchdog group that supports the use of clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
            response to a request for comment, Microsoft told Bloomberg BNA: 'In 2014, Microsoft decided to no longer
            participate in the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) Communications and Technology Task Force.
            Our trade association memberships are determined annually on a case by case basis and are based on a number
            of factors, including evolving policy priorities, business needs and available budgets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Question
            of Budget Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Meierling, a spokesman for ALEC, said Microsoft left the organization
            July 16 for budgetary reasons and not as a result of the group's positions on renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'They
            left because of budget cuts. They are rearranging their government relations here in D.C.,' Meierling said
            in an interview with Bloomberg BNA. 'This is groups opposed to ALEC up to their old tricks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            announced July 17 it planned to eliminate as many as 18,000 jobs, the largest round of cuts in its history,
            Bloomberg News reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sustainability Group, along with Walden Asset Management,
            said in a joint news release Aug. 19 that they began pressing Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to leave ALEC
            in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According the groups, Microsoft, which had been a member of ALEC's Communications
            and Technology Task Force, sent an e-mail on July 14 that said, 'We are no longer members of ALEC and do not
            provide the organization with financial support of any kind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;E-Mail Called Part of
            Ongoing Dialogue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Timothy Smith, Walden Asset Management's senior vice
            president and director of environmental social and governance shareowner engagement, said the e-mails, which
            the group sent to investors last month, were part of an ongoing dialogue Walden had been having with
            Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It was an ongoing debate inside the company,' Walden said of the company's
            participation in ALEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walden, which manages $8 billion in assets, considers Microsoft one
            of its major holdings, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALEC approved model legislation for the 2013
            legislative session designed to be used to repeal states' renewable portfolio standards and wrote a new
            version for 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standards, which exist in 29 states, have been credited with being
            one of the largest drivers of renewable energy generation in the U.S. and are expected to drive more than
            40,000 megawatts of renewable electricity generation by 2015, according to the Energy Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According
            to the Environmental Protection Agency, 50 percent'or more than 1.3 billion kilowatt hours'of the power used
            by Microsoft annually comes from renewable energy sources, including biogas, biomass, solar and wind. That
            makes it No. 3 on the EPA's list of top companies that voluntarily use renewables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Called
            Example to Others&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Microsoft has demonstrated a commitment in recent years to clean
            energy and climate action by introducing an internal carbon fee and purchasing large amounts of wind energy
            to power two of its data centers'all actions which run contrary to ALEC's goal of killing the clean energy
            economy,' Greenpeace Senior IT Policy Analyst Gary Cook said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Google,
            Facebook, eBay, Yahoo, Yelp and other technology companies that are currently still ALEC members would do
            well to learn from Microsoft's leadership,' Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other major corporations that have
            left ALEC include Coca-Cola, General Motors, Bank of America and Procter Gamble, according to Common Cause,
            a Washington group that has challenged ALEC's status as a nonprofit organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According
            to Common Cause, 'the exodus' began in 2011 after public exposure related to the group's development of
            proposals to block renewable energy, as well as other issues such as restrictive voter ID requirements,
            anti-union measures and 'Stand Your Ground' gun bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Consumers Should Decide Energy
            Choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meierling said ALEC continues to grow and isn't opposed to renewable energy
            specifically. Rather, Meierling said, the group believes consumers, not mandates, should decide consumer
            energy choices.For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit

        <headline>Microsoft Raises $8 Billion With Bond Offering in Dollars, Euros</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) sold $8 billion of
            bonds in dollars and euros, a record offering from the world's
            largest software maker that followed Johnson Johnson by
            issuing AAA rated corporate securities this week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft borrowed $3.25 billion with five-, 10- and 30-year notes in the U.S. currency, according
            to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The Redmond, Washington-based company also issued 3.5
            billion euros ($4.8 billion) of bonds split between eight- and
            15-year portions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Top-ranked borrowers are seeking to raise cash from the
            bond market even as investors favor the higher yields of lower-rated debt amid speculation the Federal
            Reserve will soon taper
            stimulus measures that pushed interest rates to record lows. The
            Bank of America Merrill Lynch AAA U.S. Corporate Index has lost
            4.2 percent this year, compared with a 6.9 percent gain for
            dollar-denominated speculative-grade securities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds will fund general corporate purposes, Microsoft
            said in regulatory filings today. The euro sale is more than six
            times the size of its only previous issue in the currency of 550
            million euros in 20-year notes that won a record-low 2.625
            percent coupon for similar-maturity nonfinancial corporate bonds
            on April 25, Bloomberg data show. That sale coincided with
            almost $2 billion of dollar debt issued in three parts. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it's selling
            every Xbox One player it can make, after introducing the new
            game console on Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales are setting records, the Redmond, Washington-based

            specific. Users have already spent more than 50 million hours on
            games and entertainment, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Demand is far exceeding supply in the 13 countries we've

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft may not want to issue a lower number than the 2.1
            million units that Sony Corp. (6758) reported it had sold as of Dec. 1
            for the PlayStation 4, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at
            Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. The software maker limited
            its Xbox introduction to 13 countries, from 21 initially
            planned, to make sure larger markets had sufficient supplies,
            and reported first-day sales of more than 1 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Microsoft with Edelman public relations
            declined to comment yesterday beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sony (SNE), which introduced the PlayStation 4 starting Nov. 15,
            said yesterday its tally included about 700,000 units purchased
            by consumers in Europe and Australasian markets after the player
            went on sale in those regions Nov. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Each company probably has factory capacity to make
            1 million consoles a month, said Pachter. About 55 percent of
            the 4.5 million PlayStation 4s produced by the end of January
            will go to North American retailers, he estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, fell 0.4
            percent to $38.31 yesterday in New York. The stock has gained 43
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sony American depositary receipts fell 1 percent $18.41 and
            have gained 64 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Bank of America
            Corp. (BAC) are marketing bonds in euros, spurring deals in the
            currency from U.S. borrowers to the most since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American companies have raised 39 billion euros ($53
            billion) from debt sales this year, compared with 20 billion
            euros in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            average yield gap between investment-grade bonds in euros and
            dollars is 1.3 percent, approaching the widest discount for
            borrowers in the common currency since Sept. 13, Bank of America
            Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank's decision to cut its benchmark
            rate last month as it seeks to boost a sputtering recovery in
            the 17-nation bloc helped extend the advantage for borrowers in
            euros. Speculation the Federal Reserve will start reducing
            stimulus increased yesterday when data showed U.S. manufacturing
            grew in November at the fastest pace in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The euro market is much cheaper than the dollar market
            today,' said Microsoft Treasurer George Zinn in an e-mailed
            response to questions. 'We are being opportunistic and looking
            at rates across the globe. We can use the proceeds from these
            bonds for any general, domestic purpose.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Favors Europe for Record Bond Sale: Corporate Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which issued the
            first euro-denominated bond in its 38-year history in April, is
            favoring the currency in its biggest sale ever, taking advantage
            of a widening discount to dollar borrowing costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker sold 3.5 billion euros
            ($4.8 billion) of bonds yesterday to account for more than half
            of an $8 billion issue. Corporations are paying 1.13 percentage
            points less to borrow in euros than dollars for debt of five to
            10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Two years
            ago, the relationship was reversed, with euro yields eclipsing
            dollar rates by 1.2 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Microsoft sold notes in April, the discount was only
            0.47 percentage point, and the company's debut euro bond
            comprised about a quarter of a $2.67 billion issue. The Redmond,
            Washington-based company's newest offering adds to about 40
            billion euros of issuance by American companies in 2013, almost
            double the amount sold in 2012, as the European Central Bank
            cuts interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You've got a confluence of events between monetary
            policy, interest rates and overall demand from investors, and an
            improving basis, all of which has made it very attractive to
            issue in euros,' said Jim Glascott, head of global debt capital
            markets at Barclays Plc, which helped manage the Microsoft
            offering. 'The demand and the attractiveness of euros is
            something that's definitely going to affect volumes in 2014.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. food and beverage company Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) is following Microsoft Corp.
            selling bonds in Europe as borrowing costs fall. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The maker of Oreo cookies is marketing
            a total of 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion) of fixed- and floating-rate notes, according to a person
            familiar with the matter. The average yield investors demand to hold corporate bonds in euros instead of
            government debt dropped six basis points this week to 123 basis points, the lowest since June 12, Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;American companies are raising funds in the
            common currency at the fastest pace since 2008, with Microsoft's 3.5 billion-euro issue yesterday boosting
            the total for the year to 44 billion euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Borrowers are
            speculating the European Central Bank will hold benchmark rates at record lows as a report today showed the
            region's economy slowed in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'In Europe we're still in an environment
            of easing from the central bank, whereas everyone is expecting tapering in the U.S. early next year,' said
            Nicolo Bocchin, a Milan-based credit portfolio manager at Aletti Gestielle SGR SpA who helps oversee about
            3.5 billion euros. 'U.S. companies see that there is demand in Europe so they issue here where there are
            lower yields.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average yield gap between investment-grade bonds in dollars and euros
            widened to 1.3 percentage points this week, near the biggest discount since Sept. 13, according to Bank of
            America Merrill Lynch index data. Euro-denominated notes yield an average 2 percent while securities in
            dollars yield 3.3 percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Three-Part Deal &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mondelez,
            based in Deerfield, Illinois, last issued bonds in euros in 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It is
            selling 400 million euros of floating-rate notes due June 2015 that will be priced to yield 50 basis points
            more than the three-month euro interbank offered rate, according to the person, who asked not to be
            identified before the transaction is completed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is also marketing 750
            million euros of bonds maturing January 2017 to yield 58 basis points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate
            and 1.25 billion euros of notes due January 2021 at a spread of 93 basis points, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund a bond buyback,
            Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Mondelez in Deerfield, said in an e-mail. The company is repurchasing as
            much as $3.4 billion of notes maturing between 2017 and 2020 in a tender offer expiring on Dec. 17, it said
            in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring corporate bonds against losses was
            little changed, with the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on 125 investment-grade
            companies rising 0.8 basis point to 82 basis points at 1:39 p.m. in London. The gauge dropped to a 3
            1/2-year low of 77 basis points on Nov. 27. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Co-Founder Allen to Fund African Elephant Survey</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Allen, who co-founded Microsoft Corp. with Bill Gates, will fund a survey of the number of
            elephants in Africa to help combat poaching that is claiming the life of one of the pachyderms every 15
            minutes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The family trust of Allen, who's worth $15.7 billion according to the Bloomberg
            Billionaires Index, will fund an $8 million count of the animals in 13 countries using three fixed-wing
            airplanes and two helicopters, Botswana-based Elephants Without Borders said today in an e-mailed statement.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is the bleakest time for the elephants,' Allen, 60, said in the statement.
            'Statistics on the plight of Africa's elephants are daunting.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A fifth of Africa's
            elephants may be wiped out over the next decade if poaching continues at its current pace, with about 22,000
            killed last year, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, Traffic and the International
            Union for Conservation of Nature said in a Dec. 2 statement. The animals are poached for their ivory tusks.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estimates of the African elephant population vary between 410,000 and 650,000 and in
            some countries there haven't been surveys for many years, Elephants Without Borders said. They are now found
            in 35 African nations, down from an initial 46, and in 20 of those they number less than 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Wins EU Approval for 5.44 Billion-Euro Nokia Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won European Union
            approval for its 5.44 billion-euro ($7.4 billion) bid to take
            over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset business as regulators warned that they
            would monitor Nokia's licensing practices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission said it 'will remain vigilant and
            closely monitor Nokia's post-merger licensing practices under EU
            antitrust rules,' according to an e-mailed statement. Any
            possible competition concerns over Nokia's conduct as the owner
            of a portfolio of smartphone patents 'falls outside the scope'
            of the EU's review of the Microsoft transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's bid for Nokia's mobile-phone business didn't
            raise any antitrust issues because the companies' businesses
            only have a 'minimal' overlap, the EU said. Microsoft is
            unlikely to restrict the supply of its Windows operating system
            for mobile phones or its mobile apps or to restrict rivals'
            access to its business mail service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker will pay 3.79 billion
            euros for Nokia's devices division and 1.65 billion euros to
            license patents, according to a statement from the companies.
            Microsoft and Nokia face an EU antitrust complaint filed by
            Google Inc. last year that alleged the companies were using
            patents to thwart competition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Google Complaint &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has also complained in its own name and as part
            of industry groups over Google's Android operating system for
            mobile phones and its search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is 'pleased that the European Commission has
            cleared the deal without conditions,' Robin Koch, a spokesman
            for the company in Brussels, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company won approval from the
            EU for the deal more than eight months after it was fined 561
            million euros by the same regulator for violating the terms of
            an antitrust settlement to give users a choice of Web browsers.
            The penalty was the fourth levied on Microsoft by the EU since
            it was fined 497 million euros in 2004 for blocking rivals for
            server and media programs. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will expand the use
            of encryption to protect customer information, following reports
            that governments are intercepting data traveling between users
            and servers or between company data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company will also step up its legal efforts to protect
            private data and will make its software code more transparent so
            customers can reassure themselves Microsoft's products don't
            contain 'back doors' allowing access to their information, the
            Redmond, Washington-based software company said in a post on its
            official blog today. The encryption enhancements will be
            completed by the end of next year, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are taking steps to ensure governments use legal
            process rather than technological brute force to access customer
            data,' Microsoft said. 'Government snooping potentially now
            constitutes an 'advanced persistent threat' alongside
            sophisticated malware and cyberattacks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. and Google Inc. have also announced they'll
            beef up encryption, following reports of spying by the U.S.
            National Security Agency. The NSA has tapped fiber-optic cables
            abroad to siphon data from Google and Yahoo, circumvented or
            cracked encryption, and introduced weaknesses and back doors
            into coding, according to reports in the Washington Post, the
            New York Times and the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper based on
            documents released by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s digital crime unit
            has teamed up with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and
            its European counterpart to fight software that infected more
            than 2 million computers to steal revenue from online
            advertisers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They're working to track down computers that have been
            taken over with the malicious software known as ZeroAccess or
            Sirefef, and get rid of the malware, Microsoft said in a
            statement. While the effort won't eliminate the threat, it
            should significantly reduce the fraud, which has cost online
            advertisers an estimated $2.7 million a month, the Redmond,
            Washington-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 'botnet,' a group of connected programs, is used to
            redirect queries in search engines owned by companies such as
            Google Inc., Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft, to certain sites to
            steal money generated by ad clicks. It also creates automated
            Web traffic that simulates users' clicks on ads, for which
            advertisers pay. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Due to its botnet architecture, ZeroAccess is one of the
            most robust and durable botnets in operation today and was built
            to be resilient to disruption efforts,' Microsoft said in the
            statement. The malware relies 'on a peer-to-peer infrastructure
            that allows cybercriminals to remotely control the botnet from
            tens of thousands of different computers.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            Microsoft filed a civil suit against those operating ZeroAccess last week and got authorization from the
            U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas to block communications between computers that had
            been identified as being used to commit the schemes. Microsoft also took control of 49 web domains thought
            to be affiliated with ZeroAccess. Close

            potential successor to Ballmer. Nadella is on a list of more
            likely candidates at the Redmond, Washington-based company,
            people familiar with the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The board is aiming for a quick replacement for Ballmer,
            who said in August that he will retire within the next 12
            months. Microsoft has seen its software leadership decline amid
            a shrinking of the personal-computer market, which was its core
            business. Microsoft is shifting its strategy to focus more on
            hardware and Internet-based services and away from its software
            roots as it competes with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The search for a new CEO hasn't affected day-to-day
            business, Nadella said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Re-engineer Ourselves' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's not like there wasn't any change we had to navigate
            over the past 30 years,' he said. 'If we didn't know how to do
            it, we wouldn't be here. We've shown our ability to re-engineer
            ourselves.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Part of that push is to compete with Amazon.com Inc. on
            selling cloud-computing services to companies. The executive
            said he met with customers in France this week to talk about
            moving faster to cloud services that can be accessed at a
            distance. He said clients are 'excited,' though they're
            increasingly worried about data-privacy issues. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Customers were asking before -- they're asking more
            now,' Nadella said about data privacy. 'It's actually working
            to our advantage because we have the flexibility to tailor to
            our customers' needs.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft yesterday joined technology companies including
            Apple and Google to call on the U.S. government to lead reform
            of surveillance practices after revelations the National
            Security Agency gained access to private networks to conduct
            spying. Other signatories of the statement, addressed to
            President Barack Obama and members of Congress, are AOL Inc.,
            Facebook Inc. (FB), LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD), Twitter Inc. (TWTR) and Yahoo! Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Encrypting data and storing them on equipment based in
            specific countries or regions are among the proposed solutions,
            Nadella said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft slipped less than 1 percent to $38.48 at 10:09
            a.m. in New York. The stock gained 45 percent this year through
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Xbox One Sales Hit 2 Million in Race to Catch Sony</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said sales of the
            new Xbox One video-game console reached more than 2 million in
            its first 18 days on the market, as the company vies to keep
            pace with Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 4 during the holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sony said on Dec. 3 that it had sold 2.1 million of its
            machines since they went on sale Nov. 15 in North America.
            Microsoft, which introduced Xbox One on Nov. 22 in 13 countries,
            is selling pretty much every console it can get into stores and
            has 'aggressive' plans to restock, said David Dennis, a
            spokesman for Xbox, in an interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Sales of both platforms are basically on par with each
            other,' said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird
            Co. in San Francisco. 'Production seems to be roughly the same
            for both platforms and they're both doing well at retail.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Sony are trying to attract gamers against a
            backdrop of declining console sales. From 2008 to 2012, the
            market shrank 32 percent to $13.3 billion, according to
            researcher NPD Group Inc. Both the $499 Xbox One and the $399
            PlayStation 4 have more powerful graphics and entertainment
            applications than older models. To distinguish its machine,
            Microsoft has been pitching its motion-sensing camera, the
            ability to control live television and exclusive games like
            'Ryse: Son of Rome' and 'Dead Rising 3.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're at 2 million at 18 days, and they were at about 2
            million at 18 days, so we are running neck and neck,' Dennis
            said. He declined to provide a forecast for future sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;November Report &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects PlayStation 4 sales to top Xbox One when
            NPD releases its November sales data for the U.S. tomorrow,
            Dennis said. He attributed the lead to Sony's extra days on sale
            in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After replenishing initial inventories, Sony and Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft each may sell about 3 million
            consoles worldwide by the end of the year, according to
            projections by Sebastian as well as Michael Olson, an analyst at
            Piper Jaffray Cos. in Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jack Tretton, president and chief executive officer of
            Sony's U.S. computer entertainment division, said Nov. 11 that
            the Tokyo-based company is confident it can meet analysts' sales
            estimates of 3 million units by year-end, and its own target of
            5 million units by March. Sony expanded sales of the PlayStation
            4 on Nov. 29, and it was available in 32 countries as of Dec. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both consoles sold more than 1 million units in their first
            24 hours in stores. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Cisco Loses Bid to Reverse EU Approval of Microsoft-Skype</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) lost a court bid
            to block the European Union's unconditional approval of
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s $8.5 billion-takeover of Skype Technologies
            SA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cisco 'failed to demonstrate' that the EU was wrong to
            clear the deal, the EU General Court, the 28-nation bloc's
            second-highest tribunal, ruled today. The merger 'does not
            restrict competition' in the markets for consumer- and
            business-video communications, the court said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's plan to buy Skype, the world's most popular
            international calling service, was waved through in October 2011
            by EU regulators who said the deal wouldn't harm competition
            because the market was growing and they faced 'numerous
            players, including Google.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cisco, the largest maker of computer-networking equipment,
            said it was 'disappointed' the court 'did not require the
            commission to revisit interoperability requirements for the
            Microsoft-Skype merger,' according to an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robin Koch, a Microsoft spokesman in Brussels, welcomed the
            court's decision. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Innovative Products &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission said the ruling 'confirms' its
            assessment of new markets and technologies. The decision to
            clear the deal 'did not put the development of innovative
            products and services at risk,' said the Brussels-based EU
            antitrust authority. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cisco had argued in its appeal that the EU regulator used
            'flawed reasoning' that conflicted with its approach in
            previous cases. It told the court that the Microsoft-Skype tie-up would give them a combined share as high
            as 90 percent of the
            market for video calls on Microsoft Windows-based computers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court said today that even if the deal gave Microsoft
            such a market share, it wouldn't enable it 'to significantly
            harm effective competition.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is: T-79/12, Cisco Systems and Messagenet v.
            Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nokia India Plant Sale to Microsoft Cleared as Court Frees Asset</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;An Indian court lifted an asset
            freeze linked to a federal tax demand on Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) easing the
            path for the Finnish company's 5.44 billion-euro ($7.5 billion)
            sale of its handset business to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia must deposit 22.5 billion rupees ($364 million) into
            an escrow account within 30 days, which may ultimately be used
            to cover the Espoo, Finland-based company's disputed tax dues of
            at least 20.8 billion rupees, according to a ruling by the court
            in New Delhi. In exchange, India's Income Tax Department will
            return control of assets including a mobile-phone plant in the
            southern city of Chennai, according to the court's ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The injunction, ordered by authorities in September, would
            have complicated Nokia's deal with Microsoft by risking
            elimination of the Indian assets from the sale had the court
            ruled in India's favor, the manufacturer said last month. The
            Finnish company could face a tax bill of as much as 210 billion
            rupees should a court order Nokia's local unit to pay taxes on
            royalties to its parent company, said Mohan Parasaran, the
            government lawyer for the case. Nokia has said the claims are
            without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brett Young, a spokesman at Nokia, said the company is
            'currently analyzing the Delhi High Court's ruling and will
            only comment once that work is done.' Microsoft's acquisition
            is slated for completion in the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Feature Phones &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia said the Chennai plant had continued operations while
            the assets remained frozen. The facility makes feature phones
            which are distributed across Asia and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The claim against Nokia adds to mounting demands against
            foreign companies in India where investors including Vodafone
            Group Plc (VOD), Royal Dutch Shell Plc and International Business
            Machines Corp. face disputes over so-called transfer pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As of March, more than 2 trillion rupees in tax demands
            were locked up in various Indian courts, estimates by BMR Legal
            in New Delhi show. Indian tax authorities and courts have ruled
            on more than 4,500 transfer-pricing cases since 2011 valued at a
            combined 1.1 trillion rupees, according to BMR. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bombay High Court ordered Vodafone India to take its
            $200 million transfer-pricing case to a dispute resolution panel
            after ruling that tax authorities had not properly evaluated the
            merits of the income being taxed, said Mukesh Butani, a partner
            at BMR. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Must be Terrified by Penney Lesson, MIller Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) directors seeking a
            new chief executive officer to reinvigorate the software maker
            should be mindful of the lesson of J.C. Penney Co., said Steve Miller, who spent his career helping hobbled
            companies survive. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What must terrify them is the example, say, of J.C.
            Penney,' Miller, the chairman of American International Group
            Inc. (AIG), told Bloomberg Television's Stephanie Ruhle and Erik Schatzker in an interview today. 'They
            decided they needed to
            change, they brought in Ron Johnson, did a radical shift in
            their whole strategy, and it was a complete failure.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney hired Johnson from Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he turned
            the iPad maker's stores into a lucrative retail empire. At J.C.
            Penney, Johnson scaled back discounts and sought to transform
            the department-store chain into collections of boutiques. The
            company replaced Johnson with former CEO Mike Ullman in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the largest software maker, has been considering
            outsiders for the CEO post. Its list of candidates has included
            Ford Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally and Qualcomm Inc. Chief
            Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf, according to people familiar
            with the matter. Mollenkopf was removed from the running today
            when Qualcomm named him CEO. Microsoft is replacing Steve
            Ballmer who took over as CEO in 2000 from Bill Gates. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google's Motorola Loses Bid to Overturn Microsoft Victory</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Motorola Mobility unit
            lost an appeals court bid to invalidate a patent Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
            used to win a ban on U.S. imports of some mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility failed to prove the technology covered by
            Microsoft's patent was previously used in Apple Inc.'s failed
            Newton personal digital assistant of the 1990s, the U.S. Court
            of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an
            opinion posted on its website today. Motorola Mobility conceded
            it infringed the patent and pinned its arguments on claims the
            invention wasn't new. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patent, which covers a way mobile devices synchronize
            calendars with computers, is part of Microsoft's ActiveSync
            software that Motorola Mobility licensed before the two
            companies started fighting. Microsoft has also sued U.S.
            officials, claiming the import ban isn't being enforced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is part of a broader argument by Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft that Google's market-dominant Android
            mobile phone operating system uses its technology. Motorola
            Mobility, which was acquired by Mountain View, California-based
            Google in 2012, is one of the biggest holdouts from an Android
            licensing program that Microsoft started three years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Even after a closer look by the Federal Circuit, it's
            clear Google is using patented technology Microsoft worked hard
            to invent,' David Howard, Microsoft's deputy general counsel,
            said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Syncing Feature &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google's Android operating system is the most popular
            platform for smartphones, with 81 percent of the global market
            in the third quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
            Motorola Mobility's handset sales don't rank in the top 10.
            Microsoft's operating system, used with Nokia Oyj's Lumia
            phones, had 3.7 percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're disappointed with this decision but pleased with
            the overall outcome,' said Will Moss, a spokesman for Motorola
            Mobility. 'Microsoft lost on eight of its 'best' patents, and
            this lone opinion does not impact our ability to build great
            products that people love.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft separately appealed aspects of the U.S.
            International Trade Commission case it lost. The Federal Circuit
            in October revived Microsoft's claims involving one patent.
            Since the patent expires this month, Google wouldn't face any
            import ban from the ITC though the ruling boosts Microsoft's
            chance of seeking cash compensation in district court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft contends any Motorola Mobility phone that has the
            syncing feature infringes the patent, and has sued U.S. Customs
            and Border Protection, saying its officials aren't stopping
            phones from entering the U.S. The government has asked that the
            case be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Motorola Mobility case against Microsoft, seeking to
            block imports of the Xbox video-gaming system, failed at the ITC
            and is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cases are Microsoft Corp. v. ITC, 12-1445, and Motorola
            Mobility LLC v. ITC, 12-1535, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the
            Federal Circuit (Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of
            Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
            Thereof, 337-744, U.S. International Trade Commission
            (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Alan Mulally's candidacy for the top job at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) threatens to overshadow car
            introductions at Ford Motor Co. (F) and raises the risk of internal strife among his deputies at the

            Michelle Krebs, an analyst for auto researcher Edmunds.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It is a distraction at a
            time when they need to focus on plants, products and people -- not one person,' Krebs said. 'They are
            launching more products next year than any time in the history of Ford Motor Co. They need to focus on the
            business.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Mulally, Executive Chairman Bill Ford and other
            company leaders have frequently reiterated a 13-month-old plan that called for Mulally to stay at the helm
            of the second-largest U.S. automaker through at least next year. While Ford has established a successor in
            Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, questions over timing risk a return to the executive infighting that
            afflicted the pre-Mulally Ford, said a person at the company with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to
            be identified discussing managers' roles. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Losing Mollenkopf Shows Challenge of CEO Hunt</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates told shareholders last month the software maker's chief
            executive officer is a 'complex role to fill.' As the board seeks a final candidate, it's finding out just
            how right he is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm Inc.'s No. 2 executive, was named CEO Dec.
            12, taking the 44-year-old out of the running to replace Steve Ballmer at Microsoft. While Alan Mulally,
            Ford Motor Co.'s CEO, is considered a candidate to lead Microsoft, his star faded amid concerns about his
            age, 68, and lack of technology experience, people with knowledge of the search have said. EBay Inc. CEO
            John Donahoe and former VMware Inc. CEO Paul Maritz declined to be considered, people with knowledge of the
            matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The challenge of finding a new CEO compounds the obstacles facing the
            world's largest software maker as the company undergoes its biggest transition in decades. Microsoft is
            seeking to transform itself into a provider of devices and services amid declining personal-computer sales.
            The board is seeking an executive with enough experience to run a large public company and plenty of energy
            to oversee an overhaul, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Going outside for a CEO is always riskier and
            always more costly,' said Joseph McCool, president of search-committee advisory firm McCool Group in
            Amherst, New Hampshire. 'For Microsoft, which has only had two CEOs, naming a new leader is one of the most
            critical decisions in its history. It has serious long-term implications because so much is hanging in the
            balance: the brand, the workforce, the customer base and investors.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pay Package &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another issue that could complicate the search for a new CEO is salary. If CEO pay at other
            companies is any guide, Microsoft will probably have to offer significantly more than the $1.26 million in
            compensation that Ballmer received for the fiscal year that ended in June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who
            holds 4 percent of Microsoft's outstanding shares, has been paid less than many of his top lieutenants and
            CEOs at peer companies. Mollenkopf received compensation of $14.2 million last year, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg, while Mulally earned about $21 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies typically pay a
            premium of 30 percent to 40 percent whenever they choose a new outside CEO, especially when they're
            recruiting another CEO, McCool said. Such compensation often involves extra equity or cash to make up for
            unvested stock or incentive plans they're leaving behind, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Qualified Candidate
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board is also considering at least one external candidate who hasn't been named
            publicly, two people familiar with the process have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for
            Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, declined to comment or make executives or directors available for
            comment. Ford Director Edsel Ford II said on Dec. 5 that Mulally was staying put through 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'No change,' Mulally told reporters last week, in response to questions about his plans to remain
            Ford's CEO. 'I love serving Ford.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a handful of people that can really do the
            job,' said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. 'You need a CEO of a $50 billion market
            cap company who wants to move to a $200 billion company and who wants to take on the challenge of turning
            Microsoft around.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spate of departures of senior executives at Microsoft over the last
            decade means many of Ballmer's top lieutenants have only served at that level for a handful of years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Difficult Choice &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Satya Nadella, Microsoft's head of cloud services, is a
            leading contender, people with knowledge of the search said in November. Even so, he has only run a business
            unit since 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Business development and evangelism chief Tony Bates and former Nokia
            Oyj CEO Stephen Elop remain in the mix, although they're considered less likely to be offered the job, the
            people said last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Susan Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Nokia, declined to comment.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft with multiple businesses, many management layers and a complex organizational
            structure, has also been a difficult company for outside executives to fit into, said BGC's Gillis. At the
            same time, it's precisely because of such a culture that some investors want to see an outsider come in and
            shake it up, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This has to be a vexing moment for Microsoft because the
            qualities they likely want in a new CEO are going to be difficult to find in one person,' said Michael
            Useem, director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at Wharton School of the University of
            Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. 'They're going to want someone who has managed a big company before and has a
            proven record for doing a turnaround.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risky Decision &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;An outsider
            still needs to fit in even if the culture needs changing, said McCool. A new Microsoft CEO would have to
            create alliances with insiders to make changes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'To do something transformative, they
            need someone who will be there for more than three to four years,' Useem said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            directors should be mindful of the lesson of J.C. Penney Co., said Steve Miller, the chairman of American
            International Group Inc. who spent his career helping hobbled companies survive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'What
            must terrify them is the example, say, of J.C. Penney,' Miller told Bloomberg Television's Stephanie Ruhle
            and Erik Schatzker in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;J.C. Penney hired Johnson from Apple Inc., where he
            turned the iPad maker's stores into a lucrative retail empire. At J.C. Penney, Johnson as CEO scaled back
            discounts and sought to transform the department-store chain, resulting in plummeting sales and Johnson
            being replaced by former CEO Mike Ullman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Radical Shift &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They
            decided they needed to change, they brought in Ron Johnson, did a radical shift in their whole strategy, and
            it was a complete failure,' Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miller, a director at Symantec Corp. since the
            1990s, was the person who convinced John Thompson to take the CEO job at Symantec. Thompson is now
            Microsoft's lead independent director and heading the search for Ballmer's replacement. Microsoft's board
            should do the same and persuade Thompson to become the company's CEO, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson
            has said publicly that he doesn't want the job. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I think the best candidate for that
            position is John Thompson himself, because of what I saw him do at Symantec,' Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Says Board Will Complete CEO Search in 2014</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which is seeking a replacement for Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer,
            said it anticipates completing the search in the early part of 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead independent
            director John Thompson, who is heading Microsoft's CEO search committee, wrote in a blog post that the
            Redmond, Washington-based company has identified more than 100 candidates, talked with several dozen and has
            since focused on about 20 individuals, whom he deemed 'extremely impressive in their own right.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As you would expect, as this group has narrowed, we've done deeper research and investigation,
            including with the full board,' Thompson wrote. 'We're moving ahead well, and I expect we'll complete our
            work in the early part of 2014.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The timeline underscores the hurdles of finding a new
            leader for the world's biggest software maker. Ballmer said in August that he planned to retire within a
            year. With no succession plan in place, the board was working toward speedily finding a successor as early
            as the end of this year, people with knowledge of the process have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:
            Microsoft's Nadella Studies Startup Roadmap Amid Search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet some candidates have dropped
            out of the running. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm Inc.'s No. 2 executive, was named CEO of the wireless
            chipmaker on Dec. 12, taking him out of the picture to replace Ballmer. While Alan Mulally, Ford Motor Co.'s
            CEO, is considered a candidate to lead Microsoft, his star has faded amid concerns about his age, 68, and
            lack of technology experience, people with knowledge of the search have said. EBay Inc. CEO John Donahoe and
            former VMware Inc. CEO Paul Maritz declined to be considered, people with knowledge of the matter have said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Complex Role' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other candidates are still in the mix, including
            Microsoft's cloud-computing chief Satya Nadella, Executive Vice President Tony Bates and former Nokia Oyj
            CEO Stephen Elop, the people have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said
            at the company's shareholder meeting that he and other directors have met with 'a lot of CEO candidates' and
            that 'it's a complex role to fill.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The software maker is going through its biggest
            transition in decades, seeking a new leader while it adopts a new corporate structure focused on devices and
            services. Microsoft is buying Nokia's handset unit, its largest acquisition by number of employees, as it
            adapts to a technology landscape where consumers and businesses favor mobile devices and Web-delivered
            software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Two CEOs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C.
            Bernstein Co., said it's important for Microsoft to find a replacement sooner rather than later 'to resolve
            investor questions and to formally and finally define the company's core direction.' He rates the shares the
            equivalent of a buy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history and both
            have been company insiders. Gates co-founded the software maker in 1975 and led as CEO until 2000, when he
            passed the reins to longtime executive Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft,
            declined to comment beyond the blog post or to make executives available for interviews. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jay
            Cooney, a spokesman for Ford, said there is no change from a plan the company laid out in November last year
            that Mulally would remain its CEO through at least 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Alan remains absolutely
            focused on progressing the One Ford plan,' he said. 'We do not engage in speculation.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Susan
            Sheehan, a spokeswoman for Nokia, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 1 percent to
            $36.52 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More Transparency &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies have
            been compelled to be more transparent on succession issues, especially as activist investors bring more
            scrutiny to company management, said Joel Koblentz, senior partner at executive recruiter The Koblentz Group
            in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investor Bill Ackman's public campaign to get a new CEO at J.C. Penney Co.
            prompted the company's other directors to publicly address the CEO search and the plans for the process.
            That search is still under way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chip Wilson, founder of retailer Lululemon Athletica
            Inc., discussed the search for a CEO in a November Bloomberg television interview before the company
            announced a decision earlier this month. The maker of exercise apparel had been under pressure from
            investors after it recalled yoga pants for being too sheer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft earlier this year
            struck a cooperation agreement with activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP. A ValueAct executive is set to
            join the company's board in early 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Boards always want to have an orderly process
            of succession, but the balance between secrecy and transparency seems to be shifting,' James Post, a
            professor at Boston University School of Management, said in an interview. 'For sure, there's no going back
            to the old way where only private searches are done.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Even as Bill Gates weighs giving up his title of chairman of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), he's poised to
            remain involved at the company he co-founded in an area of its deepest need: crafting must-have products.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the board prepares to appoint Satya Nadella as Microsoft's next chief executive
            officer, it's considering replacing Gates as board chairman, people with knowledge of the matter have said.
            Gates would remain a director and be involved in product development, focusing less on administration, the
            people said. He's weighing going to work at Microsoft at least one day a week, a person briefed on the
            matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates championed Nadella's candidacy during the months-long CEO search, a
            person briefed on the matter said, suggesting that the two will be able to collaborate well. Nadella is an
            insider who's well-versed in Microsoft's tools for businesses, while Gates was instrumental in building
            innovative products that ushered in the personal computing age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even so, the company
            under his chairmanship has struggled to replicate those early successes in new areas, including mobile
            devices and Internet services, falling behind Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Facebook Inc. (FB)
            in making things people want to buy. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;ValueAct Holdings LP President Mason Morfit, the investor set to join Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s
            board as it
            prepares to make Satya Nadella chief executive officer, will
            seek another break with tradition: how the company sells its
            flagship products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morfit, 38, and ValueAct want the world's largest software
            maker to reduce its focus on Windows, the operating system that
            underlies most of the company's offerings, according to people
            familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because
            the information is private. For two decades, Microsoft has
            focused on selling applications and server software designed to
            work specifically for Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now ValueAct wants Microsoft to accelerate efforts to
            unchain products and services from Windows so that they can be
            more widely adopted on smartphones and tablets. Microsoft
            programs like Office, which typically run on Windows, could then
            also be used on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. gadgets
            that have other operating systems, the people said. The moves
            are intended to reinvigorate growth at a company that's
            struggled to adapt to the rise of mobile devices, away from the
            shrinking personal computing arena. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Morfit also wants to emphasize enterprise and cloud
            businesses and push Microsoft to look at jettisoning or scaling
            back hardware and consumer products such as the Xbox game
            console, which carry expensive marketing and manufacturing
            costs, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will introduce
            computers from Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Acer Inc. (2353) and other
            manufacturers in the next two months, seeking to make up for the
            dearth of tablets and touch-screen devices that marred the debut
            of its flagship Windows 8 software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Hewlett-Packard Envy series device, doubling as a tablet
            and laptop, is available for order now at $849.99, while Acer
            will sell a 10-inch tablet for $499. Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)'s
            convertible tablet weighs just over 1.5 pounds and has two
            batteries for 19 hours of battery life, according to Aidan
            Marcuss, principal director at Windows Research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chip delays and Microsoft's restrictions on new hardware
            meant that the company's Windows operating system, released
            on Oct. 26, was featured on a limited number of tablets.
            Windows 8 was designed to win back customers moving to
            Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPad and tablets with Google Inc.'s Android
            software, making it critical that Microsoft's hardware partners
            offer compelling touch-screen devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I don't have concerns about awareness, and I don't have
            concerns about interest,' Tami Reller, chief financial officer
            for the Windows unit, said in an interview, when asked about
            Windows 8 demand. 'Now I feel increasingly good about mapping
            that interest to having those customers find the device they
            want on the shelf.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Executive Vice President Todd Bradley last
            month described Windows 8's initial sales as slower than many
            had expected. Microsoft now has 2,000 devices certified for use
            with the new Windows, double what was available when the
            operating system was released, Reller said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Devices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Another concern at the release in October was the lack of
            machines with Intel Corp. (INTC)'s latest low-power chips, code-named
            Clover Trail. In early December, only two Clover Trail devices
            were on sale in the U.S., and only low quantities, Marcuss said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new machines, targeted at consumers, from Hewlett-
            Packard, Acer and Asustek all use that chip, which provides a
            longer battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)'s ThinkPad Tablet 2, aimed at business
            customers with 10 hours of battery life, goes on sale this month
            for $699. Microsoft is also trying to get cheaper notebooks with
            touch features into stores since Window 8's new design is
            focused around finger swipes and other gestures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New devices that run on Windows RT, a variant of the
            operating system that runs on chips with technology from ARM
            Holdings Plc (ARM), won't be released this spring, Reller said.
            Microsoft is still focused on getting the five announced in
            October into stores in large numbers, she said. One partner,
            Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), has opted not to sell its Windows RT
            tablet in the U.S., she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Limited Selection &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs, whose
            company makes chips for Windows RT tablets, raised concerns
            about the limited selection, a result of Microsoft's
            restrictions on which manufacturers could make tablet devices
            for that system, he said. Jacobs said in an interview last week
            that his company hasn't been surprised by muted demand for the
            new Windows, as shown by the chipmaker's cautious forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The fact that there were only a handful of manufacturers
            that were allowed to participate, definitely in my mind held
            down the competition on form factors and everything that I would
            have liked to have seen,' Jacobs said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jacobs said he's confident in the long-term opportunity for
            his chips in computers, and remains committed to investing in
            the business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reller said more Windows 8-based tablets will probably be
            sold, compared with those running Windows RT. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We will scale over time, but right now we're focused on
            making sure the designs that have been built do have commercial
            availability and commercial success, and we'll stay focused on
            that for the short-term,' said Reller, who declined to provide
            updated sales numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Pick Leaves Losers Grappling With Fallout</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Now that there's a winner for the chief executive officer position at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), those
            who lost out on the job will need to decide whether to stick around. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Microsoft's
            board disclosing today that it picked Satya Nadella as CEO, that leaves internal candidates such as
            Executive Vice President Tony Bates and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner among those who failed to get
            promoted, people with knowledge of the search have said. Stephen Elop, the former CEO of Nokia Oyj who was
            set to join the software maker after it closes a $7.2 billion deal for Nokia's handset unit, was also on the
            shortlist, among others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there's no telling how long some executives might stick
            around were a better offer to come along, the conclusion to Microsoft's search may not spark an immediate
            exodus, said people with knowledge of the matter. The CEO candidates were informed that they didn't get the
            role last week, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information
            is private, giving the executives time to work out some next steps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turner plans to stay
            at the Redmond, Washington-based company, said a person close to the COO. And while Bates and Elop both have
            ambitions to be CEO, they are also set to continue at Microsoft for the time being since success in their
            current jobs may be the best way to attract other offers, said people close to the executives, who asked not
            to be identified because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Buys $15 Million Stake in Foursquare for Mobile Data</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) invested $15 million in Foursquare Labs Inc., forging a partnership that
            will help Windows-powered phones offer restaurant and entertainment suggestions to consumers on the move.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investment, confirmed in an interview by Foursquare Chief Executive Officer Dennis
            Crowley, is part of a funding round from late last year that valued New York-based Foursquare at more than
            $600 million, people with knowledge of the terms said in December. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is adding
            features to its Windows Phone software in an effort to compete with Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPhone and Google
            Inc.'s Android software, which together dominate the smartphone market. Location data from Foursquare will
            appear in a voice-activated assistant, code-named Cortana, that has yet to be released and will go up
            against Apple's Siri technology, according to a person with knowledge of the plans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'This is huge validation for the stuff we've been working so hard on,' Crowley said. 'It's one of
            the leaders in the space we work in looking at us and saying we can really help power the next generation of
            devices.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foursquare, which has struggled to generate sales in almost five years on the
            market, will get a new stream of data licensing revenue from the partnership, Crowley said. Foursquare's
            valuation has been stagnant since 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported in August that Microsoft
            and American Express Co. were both vying for a stake in Foursquare. Microsoft has been courting startups to
            add features to its phones and tablets, which lag behind Apple and Android products in the number of
            applications available to users. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cortana Coming &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cortana, named for
            the artificially intelligent character in Microsoft's popular 'Halo' video game series, is scheduled to be
            part of the Windows Phone 8.1 release, to be shown within several months, according to a person familiar
            with the project and Foursquare agreement, who asked not to be identified because details haven't been made
            public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft will gain access to
            more of Foursquare's data than the company makes available publicly and to other partners. That data would
            allow Microsoft, with a user's permission, to push out tips, suggestions and discounts tied to a person's
            location, said Zig Serafin, a vice president in Microsoft's Bing search unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're
            building some contextually aware experiences to power some upcoming products in Windows Phone,' Serafin
            said. 'This will be for anywhere you get a Bing-powered experience.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crowley and
            Serafin, along with other employees from the two companies, began working on a deal last year to collaborate
            on products, which eventually led to an investment, said the person familiar with the agreement. The
            companies did not discuss an acquisition, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Uphill Struggle &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brendan Lewis, a spokesman for Foursquare, declined to comment on negotiations with Microsoft or
            plans for Cortana. Adam Sohn, a Microsoft spokesman, couldn't immediately be reached for comment and the
            company hasn't publicly commented on Cortana. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December, Foursquare raised $35 million
            led by venture fund DFJ Growth. The company spent the year adding products for businesses to advertise to
            its users as well as ways to send instant and relevant recommendations to people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foursquare
            has 45 million users, compared with more than 230 million for Twitter Inc. and 1.2 billion for Facebook Inc.

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s new leadership could almost double the company's valuation by parting with
            a good chunk of the businesses it uses to court consumers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jettisoning units such as
            Xbox video-game consoles and the Bing search engine may be the change Microsoft needs to rejuvenate growth
            as Satya Nadella takes over as chief executive officer, said Schwartz Investment Counsel Inc., which owns
            Microsoft shares. The world's biggest software maker should go further by also splitting off Windows and
            smartphones to focus on providing services to business customers, said Stifel Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They need to decide whether it still makes sense to have those assets,' said Todd Lowenstein, a
            Los Angeles-based fund manager at HighMark Capital Management Inc., which oversees about $17 billion
            including Microsoft shares. 'Eighty percent of the value of Microsoft is on the enterprise side and it's not
            being valued that way today. The consumer side of the business gets a disproportionate amount of attention.'

            &lt;p&gt;Nadella, named CEO today by Microsoft's board, would inherit a company whose inroads in providing
            cloud-based enterprise software and services have been overshadowed by disappointments in tablets,
            smartphones and its search engine. Microsoft's price-earnings ratio is about half the median for software
            makers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, implying that the company's valuation could almost double
            if it focused just on software and services. &lt;/p&gt;

            business technology to speed up a turnaround at a software maker that helped usher in the personal-computing

            46, is replacing Steve Ballmer effective immediately after a five-month search, Microsoft said in a
            statement today. Bill Gates, the company's first CEO, will step aside as chairman, devote more time to
            product development as a director and continue running his philanthropic foundation. John Thompson, the

            Consumers and businesses are shunning PCs in favor of handheld devices made by rivals, sapping demand for

            (GOOG), Nadella will be tasked with completing strategy changes, begun by Ballmer last year, that include
            integrating the $7.2 billion integration of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit and turning Microsoft into a
            provider of services and hardware. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Signals New Era With Thompson as Chairman</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;With Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s appointment of John Thompson as chairman to replace co-founder Bill
            Gates, the world's largest software maker is looking to the veteran technology executive as the main outside
            voice in its new leadership structure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson was the lead independent director
            heading the board's search for a new chief executive officer, resulting in the appointment of Microsoft
            insider Satya Nadella to replace Steve Ballmer, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement
            today. While the naming of Thompson and Nadella, who were already involved in Microsoft's transition, signal
            continuity, it's also the biggest break in the company's history as the Gates-Ballmer duo who have been in
            charge for more than three decades step aside. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The former CEO of Symantec Corp. (SYMC), Thompson, 64, is stepping in at a crucial point as
            Microsoft remakes itself to better compete with rivals including Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) In
            picking Thompson, the board is betting that he'll be able to use his experience running a security-software
            company to help turn around Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Thompson's going to be a major voice for the
            company,' James Staten, an analyst at Forrester Research, said in an interview. 'They wouldn't have made him
            chairman, if he didn't have strong opinions about how to drive the company forward. And Satya is looking for
            strong partners on the board.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Board Responsibilities &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a video
            that Microsoft posted online, Thompson said he was 'looking forward to working closely with Satya and other
            members of the board. The board is always focused on long-term success of this great company and takes
            seriously its responsibilities to shareholders to ensure long-term success.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As
            Microsoft's key products face decline, Thompson and Nadella will oversee a transition to a new
            organizational structure and integrate the $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit. The
            management transition at Microsoft follows the worst decline on record for personal computers in 2013, when
            shipments dropped 10 percent and are projected to languish through 2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson knows
            what it's like to be at the head of a struggling incumbent. While at Symantec in 2005, he orchestrated the
            ill-fated $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software Corp., in an effort to push into data storage. When
            Thompson stepped down as CEO four years later, Symantec was contending with slowing growth amid an economic
            downturn and rising competition. Thompson joined Microsoft as a director in 2012 as part of an expansion of
            the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Florida Roots &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The son of a Florida postal worker and a
            teacher, Thompson joined International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) straight out of Florida Agricultural
            and Mechanical University in 1971. The IBM interviewer said he was interested in a stereo, so Thompson spent
            the session trying to sell him one, Thompson wrote in a New York Times column in 2012. He wound up with a
            job as a sales representative for IBM in Tampa, Florida. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson likes to tell people
            he spent '27 years, 9 months and 13 days at IBM' before joining technology security company Symantec as CEO
            in 1999. He took the company from $600 million to $6 billion in sales over his decade-long tenure, before
            stepping down in 2009. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's new chairman also currently runs Virtual Instruments
            Inc., a San Jose, California-based maker of software that tracks application and hardware performance. In an
            interview late last year, Thompson said he was determined to take the company public, something he has never
            done in his career. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Performance Management &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After joining
            Microsoft's board in February 2012, Thompson was involved in discussions about the company's performance
            under Ballmer, regulatory filings show. The board, in annual reviews, rebuked the CEO for poor results in
            Windows and tablets machines, even as it lauded areas such as server software and expense cutting. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thompson helped to create an environment that sped Ballmer's decision to retire, according to
            people with knowledge of the matter, and the director led the board in pressing the CEO on his strategy.
            Thompson listened to each board member and made sure Ballmer heard them, improving lines of communication
            and making strategy talks more productive, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Board Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new chairman is only Microsoft's second since the company was founded by Gates and Paul Allen
            in 1975. Some external candidates who discussed the CEO job with Microsoft expressed concerns they would
            lack independence if both Ballmer and Gates stayed on as directors, people familiar with their thinking have
            said. Gates and Ballmer together own 8.3 percent of the stock; Gates is Microsoft's largest individual
            shareholder with a 4.3 percent stake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new director set to join the board next month is
            Mason Morfit, president of activist shareholder ValueAct Holdings LP. He's eager to see Microsoft emphasize
            its business software and Internet-based cloud services rather than consumer technology, people familiar
            with the situation have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board, which is expanding to 10 members with the
            addition of Nadella, includes seven independent directors. Three of the seven have been on the board for
            more than eight years, including 33 years for David Marquardt, an early investor in the software maker. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is using a $2 billion loan to help finance Dell Inc. (DELL)'s $24.4 billion

            from Google Inc. and Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive officer,
            discussed the loan with Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell, according to two people familiar with the
            negotiations. Microsoft opted for a loan rather than an equity investment to avoid rankling other
            personal-computer makers that use Windows, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the
            matter isn't public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell is going private as it seeks leeway to cut jobs and adopt
            strategy shifts needed to court high-margin customers spending billions on data centers. Microsoft, which
            counts on Dell to sell PCs and servers with its software, has a vested interest in boosting Dell's
            competitiveness without jeopardizing relationships with other partners such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft is taking a more neutral stance, not giving Dell a favored nation status
            among their PC partners,' Jeffrey Fidacaro, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt Co., said in an interview. 'I
            was anticipating that they would get a preferred share or something structured, as opposed to a $2 billion
            loan. That gives them less of a presence and influence on the management after the deal.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'PC
            Ecosystem' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's investment helps to support 'the long term success of the entire
            PC ecosystem,' the company said in a statement. Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
            comment beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft won't be involved in day-to-day operations, Dell
            Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) advised
            Microsoft on the transaction, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking a stake in Dell would have
            amplified a rift with PC makers that developed after Microsoft pushed into the hardware market in October
            with its first machine, a tablet called Surface, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. The
            loan may be a less worrisome alternative, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's likely to be somewhat more
            palatable under those terms,' he said. 'There will still be some uneasiness until the full details of the
            relationship become clear in practice not just terms on paper.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Similar Path &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft went down a similar path in 2011, when it announced a partnership agreement with handset
            manufacturer and Windows Phone licensee Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) Still, Microsoft maintains a close relationship
            with other Windows Phone sellers, including HTC Corp. (2498) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the loan to Dell,
            Microsoft adds to a lengthening list of strategic investments in technology companies. The software maker
            has a stake in Facebook Inc. and invested $300 million in a Barnes Noble Inc. (BKS) subsidiary to focus on
            e-readers. It also invested $5 billion in 1999 into what was then ATT Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            invested $150 million in then-foundering Apple in 1997. The investment contributed to the very survival of
            Apple and helped put the company on the long path toward becoming the world's most valuable technology
            company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard seized on Dell's buyout as an opportunity to seek new business,
            saying in a statement that its competitor faces 'a tough road ahead.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Leveraged buyouts
            tend to leave existing customers and innovation at the curb,' Hewlett-Packard said. 'We believe Dell's
            customers will now be eager to explore alternatives, and HP plans to take full advantage of that
            opportunity.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell's shares gained 1.1 percent to $13.42 at the close in New York, while
            Hewlett-Packard advanced 2.7 percent to $16.61 and Microsoft was little changed at $27.50. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Gets Style Shift With Nadella Replacing Ballmer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Right from the start, new Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is showing
            that he will operate differently from predecessor Steve Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his first day
            leading the world's largest software maker, Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran who was yesterday named
            CEO, exuded an understated calm during a less than 20-minute webcast for customers and employees. Rather
            than the customary press conference, the 46-year-old used the event to introduce himself and take questions
            from Microsoft Vice President Susan Hauser. The first line in his memo to employees started with 'today is a
            very humbling day for me.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That contrasts with Ballmer, who for 14 years as Microsoft
            CEO was famous for his oversized personality. Ballmer, 57, once jumped out of a cake at Microsoft's 25th
            anniversary party at Seattle's Safeco Field and ran through the crowd giving high-fives as if he'd won the
            Super Bowl. In a memo to employees yesterday, Ballmer said he was 'pumped.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If jarring,
            the change in style will be one of the advantages of choosing Nadella as Microsoft's third CEO, said David
            Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. Ballmer's aggressive salesmanship during the boom days of
            the personal-computer industry exemplified how Microsoft became the world's most valuable company. Now the
            software maker needs a new approach as it plays catch-up in areas including tablets, smartphones and cloud
            services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Nadella's obviously a deep technologist, and he's going to bring that back to
            a Microsoft that hasn't had it in the CEO office for years,' Yoffie said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Changing
            Guard &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella's low-key manner is also a sign of a changing of the guard in technology,
            as larger-than-life founders and near-founders such as Ballmer leave the scene. As part of yesterday's
            changes, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stepped aside as chairman and was replaced by lead independent
            director John Thompson. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't the only technology company that has hired a
            product-focused CEO in recent years. Yahoo! Inc. recruited engineer Marissa Mayer from Google Inc. in 2012
            to be CEO, while networking-equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. recently appointed Shaygan Kheradpir, who
            had built networks for Verizon Communications Inc. and others, as CEO. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opinion: Why
            Microsoft and Everyone Else Loves Indian CEOs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This industry goes through cycles, and
            we're in a cycle where customers are looking for new products,' Kheradpir said in an interview yesterday.
            'It's not a sales or a marketing thing right now.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's decision to forgo a press
            conference on Nadella's ascension may also be an effort to show that 'the business isn't about one person or
            personality,' said Carol Blymire, a communications consultant. 'Maybe we've come to the end of the era of
            the rock star technology CEO.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Employee Rally &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a rally with employees yesterday at the
            atrium in Studio D, one of the newer buildings at Microsoft's corporate campus in Redmond, Washington,
            Nadella demonstrated some continuity with the Ballmer-Gates era. Amid a standing-room-only crowd, Nadella
            appeared with Gates and Ballmer, who have been Microsoft's only other two CEOs. Nadella emphasized the
            importance of software and talked about how the company is moving into devices and cloud services, according
            to a person who attended. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet Nadella also delivered a message that it was time for a
            change. In his e-mail to employees, he wrote, 'Our industry does not respect tradition -- it only respects
            innovation. Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Basketball, Cricket
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The differences between Ballmer and Nadella begin with their backgrounds. Nadella is an
            engineer with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, as well as an MBA that he earned by
            taking weekend classes after he had started at Microsoft. Ballmer is an Ivy League-educated businessman who
            specialized in sales and marketing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dissimilarities extend into the two men's
            personal lives. Ballmer is known as a ferocious defender and rebounder on the basketball court. Nadella
            lists poetry as an interest and one of his favorite sports is cricket, which features scheduled tea breaks.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He's a thoughtful, quiet leader who rallies people around him,' former Microsoft Chief
            Financial Officer John Connors said of Nadella. 'He works harder than anybody. He'll make the tough calls
            but he's very urbane and civil.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ballmer's Changes &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer has
            made some changes in the past year that will help Nadella, said Will Poole, a former Microsoft vice
            president who left in 2008 and remains in close touch with the company. Last year, Ballmer discontinued a
            review system he had implemented that ranked each person in every work group on a bell curve, an approach
            that forced some employees to behave more politically. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer also pushed through a
            major reorganization in July to break down walls at Microsoft. Rather than run their own discrete
            businesses, top executives now oversee functional areas, such as software and hardware engineering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer's strained relationship with Wall Street also leaves Nadella plenty of room for
            improvement, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Ballmer wasn't
            hands on with the Street,' said Ives, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. 'I expect
            Nadella to be a lot more front and center, because it's needed. He needs to prove that his vision is right.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella will still work with Ballmer in the boardroom, where both are directors. Having
            Ballmer there may make it complicated for Nadella to undo major initiatives from his predecessor, Yoffie
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Communicating with his board will be as challenging in some ways as all the other
            challenges he'll face with the external world,' Yoffie said of Nadella. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Said to Cut Windows Price 70% to Counter Rivals</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is cutting the price of Windows 8.1 by 70 percent for makers of low-cost
            computers and tablets as they try to fend off cheaper rivals like Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Chromebooks, people
            familiar with the program said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manufacturers will be charged $15 to license Windows 8.1
            and preinstall it on devices that retail for less than $250, instead of the usual fee of $50, said the
            people, who asked not to be named because the details aren't public. The discount will apply to any products
            that meet the price limit, with no restrictions on the size or type of device, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stronger competition from Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google cut revenue last quarter at Microsoft's
            devices and consumer licensing division, which includes Windows software, as the computer industry posted
            its biggest annual decline on record. By offering incentives for PC makers to sell cheaper models, Microsoft
            may be able to increase its share of the growing $80 billion tablet market and stave off Chromebooks,
            notebooks that run Google's operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which named Satya Nadella as
            chief executive officer earlier this month, is seeking to speed up development and introduction of new
            devices. It won't require products that use the cheaper licensing to complete logo certification, a process
            that verifies hardware compatibility, one of the people said. Devices aren't required to be touch-screen
            compatible, they said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julia Kelly-Echeverio, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, declined to
            comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Slower Adoption &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said earlier this
            month that it has sold more than 200 million licenses of Windows 8 since the program went on sale in October
            2012, a slower rate of adoption than the previous Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the regular Windows
            list price was $50, some of the largest global computer makers paid closer to $30 after incentives such as
            marketing funds provided by Microsoft, the people said. Products that receive discounted license fees won't
            be eligible for such marketing support and incentives, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Global
            computer shipments fell a record 10 percent last year and are forecast to continue to decline this year as
            tablets and smartphones lure consumers away from traditional desktop and notebook designs, according to data
            from market research firm IDC. Tablet sales volume -- dominated by Apple and Google, whose operating systems
            account for 95 percent of that market -- will climb an average 16 percent through to 2017. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>BlackBerry Gains as Ford Said to Pick QNX Over Microsoft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry Ltd. shares surged after
            its QNX software was said to be favored by Ford Motor Co. for
            its next-generation Sync system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford (F), struggling with in-car technology flaws, will no
            longer use Microsoft (MSFT) Corp.'s Windows for Sync, instead basing
            the system on QNX, according to people briefed on the matter.
            Using QNX will be less expensive than licensing Microsoft
            technology and will improve the flexibility and speed of the
            next Sync system, the people, who asked not to be identified
            because the decision hasn't been made public, said Feb. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry shares jumped 7.6 percent, the most since Jan.
            22. Ford was little changed at $15.18, and Microsoft slid less
            than 1 percent to $37.69. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford's decision highlights the value of QNX for BlackBerry,
            the smartphone maker that lost 95 percent of its value from
            mid-2008 to November and saw the collapse of a proposed $4.7
            billion buyout. Ford has more than 7 million vehicles on the
            road with Sync using Microsoft voice-activated software to make
            mobile-phone calls and play music. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The QNX operating system 'is the standard right now,'
            said Matthew Stover, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners in
            Boston. 'QNX is a well-known, understood OS. It's proven.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry is already a supplier of technology and
            engineering to Ford, among other automakers, and QNX technology
            is already in use in Ford vehicles on the road today, said Paul
            Leroux, a QNX spokesman. He declined to confirm Ford's decision
            and wouldn't say whether it would produce more revenue for
            BlackBerry. Susannah Wesley, a Ford spokeswoman, and Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft who
            works for Waggener Edstrom, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;QNX Asset &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since becoming BlackBerry's CEO on Nov. 4, John Chen cited
            software such as QNX and the BlackBerry Messenger service as
            assets he will look to capitalize on. Predecessor Thorsten Heins
            spoke often during his tenure for the potential of QNX to play a
            role in machine-to-machine settings such as cars interacting
            with parking meters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is really the crown jewel in BlackBerry's crown and
            could make the rest of the company shine as well,' Thilo
            Koslowski, auto analyst for researcher Gartner Inc. in Santa
            Clara, California, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The switch may help Ford, the second-largest U.S.
            automaker, address customer complaints about malfunctioning
            technology systems and touch screens that have hurt it in
            surveys by J.D. Power Associates and Consumer Reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford has said the quality of its
            vehicles has been 'mixed' each of the past three years and
            fell short of its plan to improve those results in 2013. CEO
            Alan Mulally was said to be a candidate to become Microsoft's
            chief until early this year, &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Connected Cars &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Improving Sync is crucial for Ford to draw car shoppers who
            are increasingly looking to be connected at all times. In-vehicle technology is the top selling point for 39
            percent of
            auto buyers, more than twice the 14 percent who say their first
            consideration is traditional performance measures such as power
            and speed, according to a study by the consulting firm Accenture
            released in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ford and Lincoln ranked Nos. 26 and 27 out of 28 brands in
            Consumer Reports' annual auto-reliability survey released in
            October. While the Lincoln luxury line matched the industry
            average in J.D. Power's Initial Quality study in June, the
            namesake finished 27th out of 33 brands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;QNX Users &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology companies are competing to win business from
            automakers as in-car technology becomes an increasingly
            important selling point. Google Inc. announced an alliance with
            General Motors Co., Honda Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Co. and
            chipmaker Nvidia Corp. in January to bring the Android operating
            system to cars. Apple Inc. is working with Bayerische Motoren
            Werke AG, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co. and
            others to introduce its iOS operating system to cars with
            devices such as the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry's QNX Software Systems can be found in cars made
            made by Volkswagen AG's Audi unit and BMW, according to its
            website. QNX and Microsoft are the main suppliers of automotive
            operating system software, according to researcher IHS iSuppli. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry, at the time named Research in Motion Ltd. (BB),
            bought QNX Software Systems for $200 million in 2010. In
            addition to its presence in cars, QNX technology is used to
            manage nuclear-power plants and by the U.S. military for
            unmanned aerial drones. Its customers include Cisco Systems
            Inc., General Electric Co. and Caterpillar Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Funeral Ceremony' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The switch would be a significant blow to Microsoft's
            automotive software business because Ford is by far its biggest
            customer, said Gartner's Koslowski. Microsoft also has software
            in Kia Motors Corp., Fiat SpA models, Nissan and BMW models,
            according to its website. Getting into the Ford system will
            expand QNX's industry leading position for automotive
            entertainment operating systems, which Koslowski said he
            estimates is as high as 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I look at this right now as a funeral ceremony for the
            Microsoft automotive operating system, this is last rites in a
            lot of ways,' said Guggenheim's Stover, who rates Ford the
            equivalent of a hold. Microsoft struggled because the economics
            of what they were trying to do with cars 'are totally
            different' than computers and smartphones, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The operating system in the car entertainment system has
            become more of a commodity, and now added functions are more
            important, Koslowski said. QNX has done a better job of
            integrating compatibility with other operating systems such as
            those from Apple, Google and included emerging Internet
            standards, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You have to look at it more from a perspective of how
            much functionality do I get for what price and really move your
            investment budgets to other areas that become much more
            strategic for creating differentiation,' Koslowski said. 'The
            industry is realizing it has to do a better job to create a
            unique experience for its customers.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Moves Larson-Green to Software and Services</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) hardware group chief
            Julie Larson-Green will move to the software maker's
            applications and services unit in the first executive shift by
            Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella since he took
            over earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As chief experience officer, she'll be responsible for
            'modern digital experiences regardless of device,' Larson-Green wrote in an e-mail yesterday, obtained by
            Bloomberg News.
            Larson-Green will switch to the new role once former Nokia Oyj
            CEO Stephen Elop returns to Microsoft to lead the company's
            hardware efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green, who started at Microsoft 21 years ago, had
            been put in charge of all hardware in a sweeping reorganization
            in July. That group is responsible for Xbox and the company's
            push into gadgets such as tablets, which so far is faltering as
            consumers and businesses shun the company's Surface computer in
            favor of the iPad from Apple Inc. and mobile machines from
            Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, confirmed the e-mail's
            authenticity and Larson-Green's new job title. She declined to comment further and said
            Larson-Green wasn't available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in September that Larson-Green, who led a
            design overhaul of both Office and Windows, would be superseded
            as leader of the unit that makes Xboxes and video games by Elop
            when the $7.2 billion acquisition of the Nokia handset unit
            closes and joins Microsoft's hardware unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nadella was appointed CEO earlier this month after a five-month search, charged with speeding up a
            turnaround at the
            world's biggest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green's move was reported earlier by GeekWire. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Orange Says It's Talking to Microsoft on Dailymotion Stake Sale</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Orange SA (ORA), France's largest phone
            company, said today it's in talks with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) about
            selling a minority stake in its online-video service
            Dailymotion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The operator, whose attempt to sell Dailymotion to Yahoo!
            Inc. last year was blocked, has been searching for a partner to
            help expand the smaller YouTube rival outside Europe. Orange
            wants to retain a majority stake in Dailymotion and no agreement
            has been reached at this point, spokeswoman Heloise Rothenbuhler
            said, confirming comments by Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard reported in Le Monde. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orange is also holding talks with Singapore
            Telecommunications Ltd. and Vivendi SA's cable-TV unit Canal
            Plus, the Wall Street Journal reported today. Rothenbuhler
            declined to comment about that report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yahoo neared an agreement to buy a stake in Dailymotion
            last May. Talks were interrupted when the French government,
            which owns about 27 percent of Orange, vetoed the sale. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Says Xbox One Sales Topped 3 Million Units in 2013</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), vying with Sony
            Corp. (6758) for the lead in a new generation of game consoles, said
            consumers purchased more than 3 million Xbox One players in
            2013, following the Nov. 22 debut of the device in 13 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced the
            tally today on its Xbox news website. The company is trying to
            keep pace with Sony's PlayStation 4, which went on sale a week
            earlier in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies were neck and neck in early December, with
            each selling more than 2 million units in their first 18 days.
            The $499 Xbox One and the $399 PlayStation 4 have more powerful
            graphics and entertainment functions than older models. To
            distinguish its machine, Microsoft has touted its motion-sensing
            camera, the ability to control live TV and exclusive games like
            'Ryse: Son of Rome' and 'Dead Rising 3.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Sony's PS4 clearly bounced back from our mixed early-2013
            supply chain checks, and appears to have a slight momentum edge
            among core gamers,' Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W.
            Baird Co., said today in a note. 'However, we view the
            console battle as too close to call, with both platforms selling
            well over the holidays.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dan Race, a spokesman for Sony, didn't immediately respond
            to an e-mail requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 2.1 percent to $36.13 at the close in New
            York. The stock gained 40 percent last year. Sony American
            depositary receipts advanced 0.7 percent to $17.30 after rising
            54 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google Patent Offers Probably Won't End Microsoft Suit</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)'s requirement to make new
            patent-licensing offers to Apple Inc. and Microsoft (MSFT) Corp. under
            its settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission probably
            won't resolve lawsuits among the technology giants, according to
            patent lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week's agreement requires Google to offer competitors
            'fair and reasonable' terms for using its patents included in
            industrywide standards for smartphones, tablet computers and
            other electronic devices, and to give them time to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple rejected earlier royalty demands,
            accused Google's Motorola Mobility unit of misusing its patents,
            complained to U.S. and European regulators and filed breach-of-
            contract suits in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's going to be a more reasonable offer than last time -
            - I'm not sure it's going to be perfectly reasonable,' said
            patent lawyer Robert Stoll of Drinker Biddle in Washington,
            who's not involved in the disputes. 'You might see further
            activity by the FTC if they think Google is not acting in good
            faith.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The global litigation has become central to shaping the
            worldwide market for mobile devices, which includes phones,
            tablets and e-readers, that reached $436 billion last year and
            is projected to almost double to $847 billion by 2016, according
            to Carl Howe, an analyst with Yankee Group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Patent Abuse &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FTC agreement resolved claims that Motorola Mobility,
            which Google bought for $12.4 billion last year, abused patents
            essential to industry standards to extract higher royalties.
            Industry-standard technology helps ensure products such as
            mobile phones can operate together when made by different
            manufacturers, meaning companies making those products must
            conform with the standards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the FTC settlement, Google can't try to block sales
            or imports of competitors' products during the license-offer
            process and must report to the FTC on steps it's taken to
            comply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a filing with the U.S. International Trade Commission
            today, Microsoft said that means Google must drop two video-
            coding patents from a case in which it seeks to block imports of
            the Xbox gaming system. The third patent, for a way to establish
            communication between the Xbox and accessories, doesn't relate
            to any industry norm, so wouldn't be affected by the FTC
            agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'As a result of the settlement Motorola and Google have
            entered with the FTC, Microsoft expects that Motorola will
            immediately dismiss from this investigation its claims' related
            to the two patents, Microsoft said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wireless Claims &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission already has cleared Apple (AAPL) of claims it
            infringed Motorola Mobility patents for wireless technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Making offers to appease the FTC, and European regulators
            who are investigating Google's practices, may not be enough to
            stop the litigation among the companies, said James Kulbaski, a
            patent lawyer with Oblon Spivak in Alexandria, Virginia, who's
            not involved in the cases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which said the FTC agreement does little to
            resolve issues it raised over Google's business practices,
            probably will decide it would rather wait to hear from a federal
            judge in Seattle who is considering what the appropriate royalty
            should be, he said. Apple, in a different case, has told a judge
            in Wisconsin that it won't pay Motorola Mobility more than $1
            per handset. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple also is trying to get Motorola Mobility and other
            makers of phones that use Google's Android operating system to
            stop what it calls copying of the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Clear Rules' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It takes two entities to reach a settlement and Apple has
            made clear they are doing everything they can to seek every
            possible remedy,' Kulbaski said. 'If Apple's not willing to
            settle, there can't be a global settlement.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, said the
            Cupertino, California-based company had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement doesn't require Mountain View, California-
            based Google to drop lawsuits where it is seeking cash damages.
            Nor is it precluded from trying to block imports or sales of
            competitors' products after taking the steps required by the
            FTC, including an offer of binding arbitration on issues that
            can't be resolved through negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement 'establishes clear rules of the road for
            standards essential patents going forward,' Google said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Thwarting Competition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At issue are Motorola Mobility patents related to technical
            standards on things like wireless transmissions and video
            decoding, a legacy of the company's history as a mobile-phone
            pioneer. As one of the companies that helped establish
            specifications for how the phones operate, Motorola Mobility
            pledged to license any relevant patents on fair terms to anyone
            who asked. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It demanded royalties equal to 2.25 percent of the retail
            prices of products and devices including Microsoft's Xbox and
            Apple's iPhone. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said that
            would amount to $4 billion a year, a figure Motorola Mobility
            disputed. Motorola Mobility lowered the offer in June, to what
            Microsoft said was still unreasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Because companies that participate in standard-setting
            groups have an advantage in getting their technology adopted,
            the FTC and European Commission have argued standard-setters
            shouldn't be allowed to use those patents to thwart competition.
            A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from using
            the invention. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judges in Seattle and Chicago have said Motorola Mobility
            isn't entitled to orders halting U.S. sales of products based on
            the use of standard-essential patents. The ITC, which has the
            power to block imports, is considering similar rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Court Bans &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Apple pledged not to seek court bans based on
            standard-essential patents to help gain Justice Department
            clearance to join a group that bought Nortel Networks Corp.
            patents in July 2011 for $4.5 billion. Apple, in a patent fight
            with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) that was settled in 2011, argued against the
            Finnish company's use of standard-essential patents in the
            dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google, while seeking regulatory approval to buy Motorola
            Mobility, said it would continue the handset maker's policy of
            not seeking sales bans as long as licensing negotiations were
            under way. The FTC agreement requires Motorola Mobility to take
            extra steps to resolve royalty disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Less Relief' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Google is saying the same thing they said in February,
            but with some more limitations,' said Jorge Contreras, an
            associate law professor at American University in Washington.
            'It still can go around and monetize the patents, but at the
            end of the day that's not what Google bought them for. They
            didn't buy them for a revenue stream as much as a defensive
            measure.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Dave Heiner, in a blog
            posting, criticized the FTC for not going far enough on the
            licensing question, Google's practices related to its core
            search business, or other issues on review by the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are disappointed that the FTC accepted less relief
            from Google than the DOJ obtained from Microsoft and Apple last
            year,' Heiner said. 'The good news is that other antitrust
            agencies, within the United States and overseas, are still
            examining Google's conduct.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co., which is facing an antitrust
            complaint by European regulators, dropped efforts to block sales
            of Apple products in Europe based on infringement claims related
            to standard-essential patents. In an ITC filing, Apple argued
            Samsung should do the same thing in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Stoll, the Drinker Biddle patent lawyer, said the FTC
            agreement with Google is 'very confusing' and has 'a lot of
            holes.' Still, he said, it could be a good first step in
            setting rules on how to handle standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The FTC is trying, but I think they need more
            specificity, more engagement,' Stoll said. 'A few more of
            these and they can hone something with more structure.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Leases Manhattan Offices in 11 Times Square</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's biggest
            software maker, signed a lease for offices at 11 Times Square, a
            midtown Manhattan skyscraper that was completed in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The technology company, based in Redmond, Washington, will
            join the law firm Proskauer Rose LLP in the 1.1 million-square-
            foot (102,000-square-meter) tower, developer SJP Properties said
            today in a statement. Terms, including rent payments and the
            size of the leased space, weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Including the Microsoft and Proskauer deals and seven other
            agreements signed last year, the building is more than 70
            percent leased, Parsippany, New Jersey-based SJP said. The
            company co-owns the tower, located across Eighth Avenue from the
            Port Authority Bus Terminal, with a real estate investment unit
            of Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) Proskauer Rose has more than
            400,000 square feet in the building. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's lease was reported yesterday on the website of
            the Wall Street Journal, which said the company was taking just
            more than 200,000 square feet in the tower. Microsoft and the
            landlords were represented by brokers from Jones Lang LaSalle
            Inc. (JLL), with Lisa Kiell negotiating for the tenant and Mitchell Konsker leading a team working on behalf
            of SJP. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft CEO at CES Says Tally of Windows RT Apps Surge</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
            Officer Steve Ballmer, in a surprise appearance at a technology
            trade show in Las Vegas, said the number of applications for new
            Windows tablets has increased fivefold since late October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;There are four times more applications for Windows RT
            computers now than there were when the device was introduced in
            late October, Ballmer said yesterday at the International
            Consumer Electronics Show. He said that more apps -- including
            Twitter Inc., Dropbox Inc. and Time Warner Inc. (TWX)'s CNN -- are
            coming. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer is striving to drum up interest in the latest
            flavor of Microsoft's flagship operating system while he plays
            catch-up to Apple Inc. in the $63.2 billion market for tablets.
            Early demand for some Windows tablets has appeared
            'disappointing,' according to analysts at FBR Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The availability of a broad range of apps is crucial for
            luring customers to mobile devices such as tablets. In December
            alone, the number of new apps reached 10,000, Ballmer said.
            Among them: Expedia Inc., Fitbit Inc. and AOL Inc.'s Huffington
            Post. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in late 2011 that Ballmer's address at the
            2012 CES would be the company's last keynote. He appeared
            yesterday during a presentation by Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) CEO Paul Jacobs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold five times more Windows Phone devices during
            the week of Christmas than the same period a year earlier,
            Ballmer said. He didn't give specific numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Loses China Appeal on Font Copyright, Zhongyi Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost an appeal of a
            three-year-old Beijing court ruling that it exceeded the scope
            of a licensing agreement for Chinese fonts, according to rights
            holder Zhongyi Electronic Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Beijing Higher People's Court upheld a November 2009
            judgment that Microsoft infringed Zhongyi's rights for Chinese
            character fonts, the Chinese company said in an e-mailed
            statement yesterday. 'We respect the court's decision but
            continue to believe our fonts licensing agreement with Zhongyi
            should have granted us perpetual rights to the fonts at issue,'
            Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, used the
            Chinese fonts 'without authorization' in Windows 98, 2000,
            2003, and XP Chinese editions as well as worldwide sales of
            multilanguage versions of Windows products, Zhongyi said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This ruling will not impact Microsoft customers in China
            as it pertains to older versions of Microsoft products that are
            no longer available for purchase,' the Redmond, Washington-
            based company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Calls to Zhongyi's headquarters in Beijing weren't
            immediately answered after business hours yesterday &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google Drops Two Patents From ITC Microsoft Case</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) dropped two patents
            related to industrywide technical specifications from an
            infringement complaint against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) at the U.S.
            International Trade Commission, where Google is seeking to block
            U.S. imports of Microsoft's Xbox gaming system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a motion filed yesterday at the Washington-based trade
            agency, Google's Motorola Mobility unit said it planned to
            continue its ITC case against Microsoft regarding a third patent
            that doesn't affect industry standards essential to letting
            products from different manufacturers work together. Google also
            said it would continue to seek damages relating to all the
            patents in federal-court lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google's move comes after it agreed, as part of a
            settlement last week with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to
            limits on its ability to seek orders blocking sales or imports
            of competitors' products based on so-called standard-essential
            patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It looks like Google is taking heed of the FTC's
            decision,' patent lawyer Robert Stoll of Drinker Biddle in
            Washington, who's not involved in the dispute, said in an
            interview today. 'There's been some concern they hadn't at the
            same time dropped these claims.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is 'pleased that Google has finally withdrawn
            these claims,' David Howard, deputy general counsel for the
            software maker, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Niki Fenwick, a spokeswoman for Mountain View, California-
            based Google, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reasonable Terms &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FTC settlement requires Google to offer competitors
            'fair and reasonable' terms for licensing the use of patents
            included in industrywide standards for smartphones, tablet
            computers and other electronic devices. It also requires Google
            to offer to resolve disputes through binding arbitration before
            seeking to ban sales or imports by alleging infringement of
            standard-essential patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FTC agreement resolved claims that Motorola Mobility,
            which Google bought for $12.4 billion last year, abused patents
            essential to industry standards to extract higher royalties. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two standard-essential patents that Google dropped from
            its ITC case involve technology for video decoding. The patent
            that remains in dispute at the agency is for a way to establish
            communication between Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft's Xbox
            and accessories. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. companies including Ford Motor
            Co. (F) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are poised to boost business investment
            to a record in 2014, using a growing cash hoard to propel
            corporate spending past last year's $2 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officers are buying new machinery and
            investing in real estate as a U.S. budget deal and growth in
            Europe signal a rebound in customer demand. That marks a
            reversal from four years ago, when companies began restraining
            spending from pre-recession levels and made do with the oldest
            equipment in 15 years, according to BMO Capital Markets Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The U.S. is on the verge of an early capex recovery, one
            that is likely to have some considerable legs,' said Brian Belski, BMO chief investment strategist. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CEOs who raised dividends and increased share repurchases
            in recent years now must lay the groundwork for future profit
            increases, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at
            Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. Investment will rise 6.7 percent,
            after a gain of about 2.6 percent in 2013, according to UBS
            Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They've got the cash and they have no choice,' said
            Scott Davis, a Barclays Plc analyst in New York who covers
            industrial companies including General Electric Co. and
            Honeywell International Inc. (HON) 'They need to grow and they don't
            want to lose market share.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft, Intel PCs to Keep Losing Share, Canalys Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Computers running Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s
            Windows software and Intel Corp. (INTC)'s processors will continue
            losing market share to tablets and smartphones this year,
            according to researcher Canalys. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;So-called Wintel machines will grab 65 percent of the
            computer market this year, down from 72 percent in 2012, Canalys
            said. In the fourth quarter of last year, combined shipments of
            desktops, netbooks and notebooks declined about 10 percent from
            the same period in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Windows 8, a new version of Microsoft's flagship software
            revamped to work with touch-screen machines, hasn't helped boost
            PC sales because many consumers resisted the need to learn a new
            operating system, Canalys said. As PCs fall out of favor, the
            market for tablets such as Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPad and touch-screen
            devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Android software will surge to
            reach 59 percent of the market, or 389 million units, by 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Wintel PCs are becoming less likely as an individual's
            first choice of computing device for everyday tasks, such as
            sending e-mail or Web browsing,' Pin-Chen Tang, an analyst at
            Canalys, said in a research report. 'Pads and, increasingly,
            smartphones can perform many of the day-to-day computing tasks
            that most people require.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758), maker of the PlayStation games console, is
            seeking a patent on a technology that would block the use of
            second-hand games on its device. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Application 20130007892, published in the database of the
            U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 3, covers a method of
            restricting the use of electronic content stored in a recording
            medium. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This would be accomplished by embedding radio-frequency
            identification tags in the medium that would have to match the
            use-permission processing system in the console, according to
            the application. It wouldn't be necessary for the device to be
            connected to the Internet for the use-permission system to
            operate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tokyo-based Sony said it intends to sell the game disk and
            the use-permission tag as an inseparable set. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sony applied for the patent in September, according to the
            application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lack of Patent Notice Tipped POWs to Monopoly-Game Escape Maps &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Monopoly games sent to allied prisoners detained in Nazi
            concentration camps during World War II often contained escape
            maps and secret messages, the U.K.'s Guardian newspaper
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Waddingtons, the U.K. publisher of the Monopoly game,
            worked with a secret department of the U.K. government to
            develop game boards with hidden content, and they were
            distinguished from those without special content by the omission
            of the 'patent applied for' notice, according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Waddingtons, which was acquired by U.S.-based toymaker
            Hasbro Inc. (HAS) in 1994, laminated silk escape maps within the
            Monopoly boards, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The games were sent to the camps by fake charities, from
            fake addresses or bombed-out buildings, the Guardian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Patent Sought for Use of Bruker Device to Find Drug Resistance &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A precision scientific instruments made by Massachusetts-
            based Bruker Corp. (BRKR) is a key element in a new technology to be
            used to identify antibiotic-resistant diseases, the company said
            in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam have
            applied for a patent on the use of a specialized mass
            spectrometry instrument to detect the patterns of chemical
            degradation of an antibiotic in a particular patient that would
            indicate that a particular antibiotic is ineffective, according
            to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bruker signed an exclusive license with Erasmus University
            for the use of this technology, which will enable rapid testing
            for drug resistance in a clinical setting, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said the World Health Organization, a United
            Nations agency, has reported that the resistance of some
            pathogens has now reached 50 percent in some countries, and
            about 400,000 such infections are occurring in Europe each year,
            leading to 25,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Theo Luider, head of the Laboratories of Neuro-Oncology,
            Department of Neurology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, said in
            the Bruker statement that the patent application covers
            'methods and means for characterizing antibiotic resistance in
            microorganisms.' &lt;/p&gt;

            deodorizers for cars, has won $100,000 in a trademark-
            infringement case against a Nevada company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to a Jan. 4 ruling, Air Fresheners Inc. of Las
            Vegas is ordered to quit making any reference to 'Little
            Tree'-related trademarks, and has to quilt selling any
            infringing products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to the $100,000 judgment, the court ordered Air
            Fresheners to pay Watertown, New York-based Car-Freshner $10,000
            for each future infringement plus $1 for each infringing product
            produced or distributed after Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the past decade, Car-Freshner has filed more than 30
            trademark-infringement suits against a wide range of defendants,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company sued Air Fresheners in federal court in
            Syracuse, New York, in December 2009, claiming its trademarks
            were infringed by the sale of tree-shaped deodorizers and that
            the defendants were using hidden text in Internet ads to drive
            potential Car-Freshner customers to their site. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Car-Freshner Co. v. Air Fresheners Inc., 7:10-
            cv-01491, U.S. District Court, Northern District of New York
            (Syracuse). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Loses China Appeal on Font Copyright, Zhongyi Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost an appeal of a three-year-old Beijing
            court ruling that it exceeded the scope of a licensing agreement
            for Chinese fonts, according to rights holder Zhongyi Electronic
            Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Beijing Higher People's Court upheld a November 2009
            judgment that Microsoft infringed Zhongyi's rights for Chinese
            character fonts, the Chinese company said in an e-mailed
            statement yesterday. 'We respect the court's decision but
            continue to believe our fonts licensing agreement with Zhongyi
            should have granted us perpetual rights to the fonts at issue,'
            Microsoft said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, used the
            Chinese fonts 'without authorization' in Windows 98, 2000,
            2003, and XP Chinese editions as well as worldwide sales of
            multilanguage versions of Windows products, Zhongyi said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This ruling will not impact Microsoft customers in China
            as it pertains to older versions of Microsoft products that are
            no longer available for purchase,' the Redmond, Washington-
            based company said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Calls to Zhongyi's headquarters in Beijing weren't
            immediately answered after business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Literary Works by Woolf, Joyce, Babel Lose Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A blog in the U.K. that covers European copyright law has
            released a list of writers whose works went into the public
            domain Jan. 1. The law provides a term of life plus seventy
            years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among those on The 1709 Blog's list for 2013 are feminist
            novelist Virginia Woolf, Russian writer Isaak Babel, Canadian
            singer/songwriter Mary Rose-Anna Bolduc, 'Waltzing Matilda'
            author Banjo Paterson, and Irish novelist James Joyce. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;BSA Establishes Reward Program for Software Piracy Informants &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Business Software Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy
            group of software producers, has set up a program rewarding
            those who report software piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the terms and conditions of the BSA program,
            it applies only to piracy taking place in the U.S. or Canada and
            is exclusive to business end users who use unlicensed software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BSA said it will reward those who provide information not
            previously known to the organization, and that anyone who
            reports must not be someone who has installed the software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The amount of the reward is related to the amount of
            settlement BSA receives from the organization accused of piracy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the settlement paid is above $15 million, the potential
            reward payment can be as much as $1 million, according to the
            guidelines. The smallest settlement amount that can earn a
            reward is $15,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The organization said that if it or one of its member
            companies files a lawsuit related to the facts reported by the
            informant, no reward is payable. BSA said that at its
            discretion, it could reimburse informants for their time and
            'reasonable expenses' for submitting the report, responding to
            the association's follow-up questions and attending or
            testifying at the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. (AAPL), Intel Corp. (INTC) and Symantec Corp. (SYMC)
            are among BSA's members, according its website, &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Surface Estimate Cut in Half to 1 Million Units at UBS</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s fiscal second-
            quarter earnings will be less than previously expected due to
            weak demand for personal-computers and the company's new tablet,
            Surface, according to Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thill cut his estimate for Surface sales in half, to 1
            million units for the period, which ended in December, citing
            'gloomy sentiment' after the holiday shopping season, he wrote
            in a research report today. He cut his earnings per share
            projection for the quarter by 8 cents to 76 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft initially limited sales of the device to its own
            roughly 60 retail outlets and Surface also failed to draw many
            customers away from Apple Inc.'s iPad and rival devices with
            Google Inc.'s Android software. A new business-focused version
            of Microsoft's tablet, Surface Pro, is expected to go on sale
            this month and may fare better against the iPad, Thill said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Surface Pro is the more promising' model, he wrote in
            the report. &lt;/p&gt;

            than predicted in October. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China may say economic growth slowed to 7.6 percent in the

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Candidate List Is Said to Include Ericsson's Vestberg</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s board is considering Ericsson AB Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg as
            a potential successor to departing leader Steve Ballmer, according to people briefed on the search. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vestberg, 48, is in the running alongside other candidates, said the people, who asked not to be
            identified because the process is private. Microsoft cloud-computing chief Satya Nadella and former Nokia
            Oyj CEO Stephen Elop, as well as other outsiders, are also on the list, people familiar with the search have
            said. The board hasn't yet reached a decision and who is under consideration is still subject to change.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's lead independent director John Thompson, who is heading the search, wrote in
            a December blog post that the board plans to complete a search in the 'early part of 2014.' He said the
            board started with more than 100 candidates and has since narrowed the list. Ballmer said last August that
            he planned to retire within a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We never comment on rumors and speculation,' said
            Ola Rembe, a spokesman for Stockholm-based Ericsson, in response to questions about Vestberg's Microsoft
            candidacy. Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment or to make executives available.

        <headline>FTC, DuPont, Microsoft, TJX, RIM: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Patent dispute settlements including
            so-called pay-for-delay deals between branded and generic drug
            companies jumped to 40 in the year ended in September from 28
            the previous year, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreements, the most since the agency began collecting
            data in 2003, involved 31 different brand-name drugs with
            combined sales of more than $8.3 billion, the FTC said yesterday
            in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of the 40 settlements, almost half involved agreements by
            the branded firm not to market a so-called authentic generic
            that would compete with the generic company's product, the FTC
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This year's report makes it clear that the problem of
            pay-for-delay is getting worse, not better,' FTC Chairman Jon
            Leibowitz said in the statement. 'Until this issue is resolved,
            we will all suffer the consequences of delayed generic entry --
            higher prices for consumers, businesses and the U.S. taxpayer.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By delaying the entry of cheaper generics into the market,
            pay-for-delay deals cost Americans $3.5 billion annually, the
            FTC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The FTC has challenged several patent settlements in court,
            contending that they are anticompetitive and violate U.S.
            antitrust laws. One case, involving a generic testosterone
            treatment called Androgel, is pending before the U.S. Supreme
            Court. The agency also has supported legislation in Congress
            that would restrict pay-for-delay settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;DuPont Shareholder Sues Managers Over $1 Billion Court Loss &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A DuPont Co. (DD) shareholder sued company directors and Chief
            Executive Officer Ellen Kullman, claiming mismanagement of the
            seed business led to a $1 billion judgment that threatens to
            wipe out the company's cash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed Jan. 16 in U.S. District Court in
            Wilmington, Delaware, shareholder Robert Zomolosky asked a judge
            to force Kullman and the board to pay any damages stemming from
            DuPont's loss of a patent lawsuit involving Monsanto Co. (MON)'s weed
            killer, Roundup. The jury award, the third-biggest last year,
            could grow to $3 billion depending on future legal rulings,
            according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patent case grew out of the company's effort to compete
            with Monsanto's Roundup Ready crop business, which held 90
            percent of the market for soybean and cotton seeds as of 2008,
            according to the lawsuit. Because DuPont's research wasn't
            producing results, company managers used Monsanto's technology
            to try to create seeds that could resist Roundup, a key
            requirement for farmers, Zomolosky claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Wilmington-based company plans to appeal the jury's
            verdict, according to the complaint, and has asked the judge to
            overturn the award. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DuPont's General Counsel Thomas L. Sager said in an e-mail
            statement that the company handled the Monsanto patent case
            appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are confident in the appropriateness of all our
            actions and the points raised in this lawsuit are simply a
            repetition of those we have repeatedly addressed in the course
            of the Monsanto litigation,' Sager said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During that patent lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Richard Webber ruled that DuPont 'knowingly
            perpetrated a fraud against
            the court,' by lying in court and to investors about its right
            to use Monsanto's seed technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shareholder complaint, filed on behalf of the company
            as a so-called derivative lawsuit, seeks a jury trial, corporate
            governance improvements and unspecified damages from directors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Zomolosky v. Kullman, 13-cv-00094, U.S.
            District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Seeks Patent on 'Inconspicuous Mode' Phone Technology &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., (MSFT) the world's largest software company, has
            applied for a U.S. patent on a technology that could make the
            use of a mobile phone less conspicuous in dark rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Application 20130012270, published in the database of the
            U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 10, is for what the
            Redmond, Washington-based company calls 'inconspicuous mode for
            mobile devices.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the application, the technology permits the
            adjustment of brightness and contrast to be less conspicuous,
            either by an adjustment initiated by the user or by sensors
            detecting environmental conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft says that with mobile devices now having the
            capacity to perform many different functions, sometimes they are
            used in settings where others may be disturbed by a bright
            display, such as a bedroom, boardroom or movie theater. Also,
            the home screen of the device, when operating in the
            inconspicuous mode, would be less obtrusive than when in normal
            operation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The software company applied for this patent in July 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

            use of the 'Harris Tweed' standards have settled a trademark
            dispute, the Scotsman newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Harris Tweed Authority complained that the Framingham,
            Massachusetts-based off-price retailer promoted and sold
            garments that weren't made in accord with the standards required
            for the use of the mark, according to the Scotsman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulations for the use of the name require that the fabric
            be hand-woven of pure virgin wool dyed and spun in Scotland's
            Outer Hebrides and woven in at-home workshops by island
            residents, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Terms of the settlement weren't disclosed, according to the

            &lt;p&gt;A Pennsylvania resident pleaded guilty to criminal
            copyright infringement related to broadcasts of hockey games. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Moore, 45, of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, admitted
            copying and selling recordings of hockey games and other hockey-
            related material. He did so through his www.HDHockey.Tv,
            according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office in
            Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He sold the DVDs for $19.99, and also operated a website --
            www.BroadStreetBully.com -- through which subscribers could
            download video clips of copyrighted television broadcasts of
            hockey games and related material. This included broadcasts of
            an Olympic Games hockey match and National Hockey League games. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Moore's house in
            2008 and seized more than 2,000 unauthorized videotapes, as well
            as commercial-grade equipment for copying the tapes to DVDs. He
            also had equipment to record satellite broadcasts and to copy
            multiple DVDs at a time, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Moore is set for sentencing April 15, according to court
            filings. He faces a potential maximum sentence of five years in
            prison, a fine of as much as $250,000, and has agreed to forfeit
            some of the seized items and $155,612 in proceeds from his
            business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S.A. v. Moore, 2:11-cr-00666, U.S. District
            Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Sues Ex-Employees Over Trade Secrets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), a maker of processors for
            personal computers, accused ex-employees in a lawsuit of taking
            'sensitive' company documents when they went to work for
            competing chipmaker Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former employees transferred more than 100,000
            electronic files pertaining to its graphics business in the days
            before they left the company, Advanced Micro said in a filing
            dated Jan. 14 in federal court in Boston. The employees also
            recruited other AMD workers to leave, the company claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is an extraordinary case of trade secret
            transfer/misappropriation and strategic employee solicitation,'
            Sunnyvale, California-based Advanced Micro said in the
            complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The documents included confidential information on
            licensing agreements with significant customers, proposed
            strategies concerning licensing and technical information about
            new products and processes the company is developing, the
            company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Timothy Hillman issued a temporary
            restraining order requiring the defendants to preserve all
            copies of AMD materials and computer storage devices and to
            refrain from disclosing confidential AMD information and
            attempting to hire any AMD employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter Mee, a lawyer for the four defendants, said he had no
            immediate comment. Bob Sherbin, a spokesman for Santa Clara,
            California-based Nvidia, said the company doesn't comment on
            pending litigation. Nvidia isn't a defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three of the former employees -- Robert Feldstein, Manoo
            Desai and Nicolas Kociuk -- transferred secret files to storage
            devices, according to the complaint. Feldstein, Desai and a
            fourth defendant, Richard Hagen, violated agreements not to
            solicit other employees for a period of time after leaving the
            company, AMD claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They all worked at AMD's site in Boxborough, Massachusetts,
            according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Advanced Micro asked for monetary damages and a permanent
            injunction to prevent disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Advanced Micro Devices v. Feldstein, 13-40007,
            U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;RIM Patents Anti-Espionage Technology for Mobile Devices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM), the Canadian maker of the
            BlackBerry mobile device, received a U.S. patent that may make
            it more difficult to use cameras in mobile phones to commit
            industrial espionage. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to patent 8,346,072, the technology would make it
            impossible to shoot a photo using the mobile device unless the
            device has been focused steadily on the subject for a
            predetermined length of time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The aim of this restriction is to make the process of
            taking the photo more conspicuous and thus more readily
            detected. Additionally, boundaries and restrictions could be
            communicated to the device as part of an information technology
            policy, according to the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;RIM said that while consumers enjoy using cameras embedded
            in their mobile phones and other hand-held devices, 'many
            corporations and governmental agencies are wary of small
            portable cameras.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Portable cameras can be used to take photos of confidential
            documents, which may then be stored and transmitted wirelessly,
            and confidential material 'can be improperly divulged and/or
            used for improper purposes,' according to the patent. The
            'ubiquitous presence of handheld communication devices in the
            business environment makes it difficult for businesses to
            control their use,' RIM said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Embedded cameras could be configured so they couldn't shoot
            photos in specific geographic areas, or they wouldn't take and
            record a photo unless they had been held in a steady position
            for as long as 10 seconds, according to the patent. RIM says
            that with these time limits, surveillance procedures would be
            more likely to identify unauthorized photos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian company applied for the patent in July. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Dell Said to Near Buyout as Microsoft Talks Deal Financing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Dell Inc. (DELL) is getting closer to clinching a leveraged buyout with Silver Lake Management LLC,
            and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is planning to provide part of the funding, people with knowledge of the matter
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silver Lake and Dell are negotiating a price in the range of $13.50 to $14.25 a
            share, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. Microsoft is
            discussing contributing about $2 billion for the deal, which could be announced this week, the person said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft stands to benefit from propping up Dell, one of its largest partners in
            selling personal computers that run Windows software. Both companies are racing to make up for an
            industrywide slump by working together on tablets, a market led by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG)
            Microsoft could also use Dell's help selling to business customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'For Microsoft to
            continue to be healthy, it needs strong enterprise partners,' said Tim Bajarin, founder of technology
            consulting firm Creative Strategies Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gemma Hart, a spokeswoman for Silver Lake,
            declined to comment, as did Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington- based Microsoft, and David
            Frink, a spokesman for Round Rock, Texas-based Dell. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the deal isn't completed this
            week, that would indicate that price has become an obstacle, and that the transaction is at risk of falling
            through, one of the people said. CNBC earlier reported that Microsoft plans to help finance the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Tablet Strategy &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell is just one of a handful of vendors selling a tablet
            machine with Windows RT, a version of Microsoft's operating system for chips running ARM Holdings Plc
            (ARM)'s technology. Dell will also begin shipping a separate tablet using the main operating system, Windows
            8, later this month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs the support of PC makers as Apple, Amazon.com Inc.
            and Samsung Electronics Co. lure consumers with tablet devices. Microsoft has also shifted its longstanding
            tactic by competing with its own partners in selling a tablet machine of its own, called Surface. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft hasn't commented on Surface sales, leading some analysts to speculate that the machine
            may not be selling well. Windows 8 also had a disappointing debut, said Todd Bradley, executive vice
            president at the largest PC maker, Hewlett- Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;PC Slump &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Computer
            makers and Microsoft are facing a prolonged downturn as PC shipments are forecast to drop for the second
            year in a row in 2013. They fell 4 percent in 2012 and will slide a further 1.5 percent this year, JPMorgan
            analysts estimate. Tablet sales rose 72 percent last year and will surge 54 percent this year, JPMorgan
            forecasts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time Microsoft has considered bolstering a potential
            Silver Lake deal. In 2011, the software maker offered to help fund an offer by Silver Lake and others to
            acquire a minority stake in Yahoo! Inc., people familiar with the matter said at the time. The deal never
            materialized. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Microsoft investment in Dell could make it difficult for the software
            company to work with other PC makers, according to Bajarin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It would complicate their
            relationship with their current partners, but it could potentially shore up a partner that is losing ground
            to Lenovo and HP,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $27.15 at the close in
            New York. Dell rose 2.2 percent to $13.12. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest
            software maker, said its Surface tablet computer running the new
            Windows 8 Pro software will be available Feb. 9, the first
            versions of the machine powered by Intel Corp. chips. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Surface Windows 8 Pro, which runs on an Intel Core i5
            processor, will go on sale in the U.S. and Canada starting at
            $899, the company said today in a statement. It will be
            available with 64 or 128 gigabytes of memory. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An earlier iteration of Surface that contains a chip with
            ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology went on sale in October for $499 to
            $699. Microsoft hasn't disclosed how many units it has sold of
            that version, called Surface Windows RT. That machine will go on
            sale in 14 additional markets worldwide in the coming weeks,
            Microsoft said today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell less than 1 percent to $27.15 at
            12:27 p.m. in New York. The Redmond, Washington-based software
            maker is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings on
            Jan. 24. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;It wasn't long after Ericsson AB Chief Executive Officer Hans Vestberg was identified as a
            contender for the top job at Microsoft Corp. before phones were ringing off the hook at the telecom
            supplier's Stockholm offices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Jan. 15 revelation was the main topic in at least one
            hastily convened meeting the next morning, according to a person who attended and isn't allowed to speak
            publicly on the matter. A Stockholm-based senior engineer said he scanned headlines first thing that day and
            was shocked by the news, even as he took pride in the prospect of Vestberg running Microsoft. The candidacy
            is likely to be discussed at an Ericsson board meeting before the end of the month, another person said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vestberg joins a growing list of executives whose staff were jolted by news that their
            boss is being wooed by another company -- in this case, to succeed Microsoft's Steve Ballmer. Alan Mulally
            of Ford Motor Co. and EBay Inc.'s John Donahoe have also been tipped for the job in recent months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Such exposure can cause frustration in the executive suite and confusion in employee ranks,
            diverting energy from the day-to-day execution of business. It might result in infighting among deputies
            seeking to fill a void left by the departing or distracted executive. To board members, it can also seem
            like their CEO has been double-dealing. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Risks Straining PC Partners With Dell Investment</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), after straining ties with computer makers by releasing its own tablet
            computer last year, risks further fissures with partners by planning to make a strategic investment in Dell
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dell is close to clinching a leveraged buyout by Silver Lake Management LLC, and

            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An investment would shore up a partner and help Microsoft gain influence in business
            computing as it loses ground with consumers gravitating toward competing tablets and smartphones. PC makers
            also may fret that the arrangement will give Dell an advantage, such as through an early look at new
            software, deeper insight into strategy or preference in product marketing and promotion. Microsoft became a
            competitor to hardware manufacturers with the release of the Surface tablet last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If
            you're a vendor that wasn't happy with Surface, the idea of Microsoft owning part of Dell is not going to
            cheer you up,' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at market-research firm Gartner Inc. 'But if you're
            Microsoft and you feel you need to do more devices, and that hardware and software need to be more
            integrated, the ability to have major influence on a big PC vendor opens some interesting opportunities.'

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will allow overseas customers to have their personal data stored outside the
            U.S., a response to concerns about allegations of U.S. government spying, Microsoft General Counsel Brad
            Smith said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith told the Financial Times in an interview at the World
            Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that while other companies oppose the idea, it's become necessary
            following leaks about the U.S. National Security Agency's data-collection programs. A spokeswoman at
            Microsoft confirmed his comments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move comes as technology companies from Microsoft
            to Google Inc. (GOOG) grapple with customer concerns after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward
            Snowden. Details about the extent of NSA spying have 'created a crisis of confidence' when it comes to users
            trusting U.S. Internet companies and undermines potential economic growth, Kevin Bankston, policy director

            and Blu-ray disc players. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The decision ends cases at the U.S. International Trade
            Commission and came just as a judge was scheduled to release
            findings in one. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two companies have used litigation before to get the
            upper hand in royalty talks over some of the most fundamental
            technologies in modern electronics. A 2007 agreement was reached
            after more than a year of lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe, with
            each getting access to the other's patents and Samsung making
            payments to Ericsson. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ITC cases are In the Matter of Certain Electronic
            Devices, including Wireless Communication Devices, 337-862, and
            In the Matter of Certain Wireless Communication Equipment,
            337-866, U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;JJ Escapes $482 Million Verdict as Court Rejects Patent Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $482 million
            jury verdict against Johnson Johnson (JNJ) over disputed heart
            devices, rejecting an appeal by a doctor who said the company
            infringed his patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday left intact a federal appeals court
            decision that overturned the verdict. The appeals court said the
            judge overseeing the trial misinterpreted Bruce Saffran's patent
            and that, under the correct definition of key terms, JJ's
            Cordis unit wasn't using his invention. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The January 2011 jury award was the ninth-largest patent
            verdict in U.S. history, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. With more than $111 million in interest, the amount
            JJ was told to pay reached $593.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Saffran v. Johnson Johnson, 13-405. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft's Online Storage Gets Name Change After BSkyB Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest software company,
            changed the name of its online storage server from SkyDrive to
            OneDrive after settling a trademark suit brought in the U.K. by
            British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSY), Computerworld reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case was settled in July 2013, with Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft promising to come up with a new name
            for the service, according to Computerworld. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Shopping-Cart Race Changes Name from Idiotarod to Idiotarodorama &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Organizers of a New York shopping-cart race known as the
            Idiotarod changed the name of the event in response to trademark
            complaints from Seattle's Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, counsel for
            the annual Iditarod dog-sled race from Anchorage to Nome,
            Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a posting on Facebook (FB), the cart-race organizers said
            they changed the name of the event to 'Idiotarodorama NYC.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There's 'no doubt' the U.S. engages in industrial
            espionage, Edward Snowden said in an interview in which he also
            asserted that he worked alone in disclosing mass surveillance by
            the National Security Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The former government contractor, now a fugitive in Russia,
            told a German television station that if a company such as
            Munich-based Siemens AG (SIE) were found to have information useful to
            the U.S., the NSA would use it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>IRobot, Allergan, Microsoft: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;IRobot Corp. (IRBT), the company that makes
            robotic vacuum cleaners, floor-scrubbers and gutter-cleaners,
            has applied for a patent on robotic assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to application 20130015596, published in the
            database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Jan. 17, this
            technology is related to the three-dimensional printing and
            manufacturing process. IRobot said in the application that this
            would be a fully automated process without human intervention
            and labor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bedford, Massachusetts-based manufacturing company said
            the technology would increase the quality of a finished product
            because it would be made all in one, without the need to attach
            additional components. In what it calls 'traditional 3-D
            printing,' connectors and fasteners are often required to
            attach component parts to each other, and these connection
            points are often the site of product failure, IRobot said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The machine that performs this operation would be a six-
            axis industrial robot that handles product from seed component
            to mature product, through the use of 3-D printing, milling and
            drilling, according to the application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IRobot filed this patent application in June 2012.
            According to the application, the two assignees or owners of the
            patent are IRobot and Raytheon BBN Technologies Corp. of
            Cambridge, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Allergan Wins Appeal Upholding Patent for Lumigan Eye Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allergan Inc. won a U.S. appeals court ruling yesterday
            that prevents Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) and Novartis
            AG (NOVN)'s Sandoz unit from selling a generic version of the glaucoma
            treatment Lumigan until August 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A disputed patent -- 5,688,819 -- which covers Lumigan's
            active ingredient bimatoprost and its use to treat ocular
            hypertension or glaucoma is valid and infringed, the U.S. Court
            of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an
            opinion posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allegan had filed the suit in federal court in Delaware in
            May 2009. The appeals court upheld a September 2011 lower-court
            victory for Allergan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeal is Allergan v. Barr Labs, 12-01040, U.S. Court
            of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The lower court case is
            Allergan Inc. V. Barr Laboratories Inc., 1:09-cvc-00333-SLR-MPT,
            U.S. District Court, District of Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Merial Sued Over Patent for Frontline Pet Flea, Tick Treatment &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Merial Ltd., an animal-health products unit of Sanofi (SAN),
            France's largest drugmaker, was sued by Horizon Valley Generics
            Inc., which asked for a ruling that it doesn't violate Merial's
            patent for Frontline flea and tick control products for pets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the complaint, filed yesterday in federal court in
            Delaware, Horizon Valley claims that Merial has 'consistently
            and aggressively litigated or threatened to litigate' its
            patent 6,096,329 in attempts to stop potential competitors from
            developing or selling any products that could compete with
            Frontline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wilmington, Delaware-based Horizon Valley said it's already
            sought approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a
            competing flea and tick product for cats and dogs, and plans to
            introduce it into the market as a generic alternative for
            Frontline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Horizon Valley Generics Inc. v. Merial Ltd.,
            U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mega Brands Claims Amloid's Big Blocks Infringe Trade Dress &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mega Brands Inc., a Canadian maker of construction toys,
            sued a New Jersey-based competitor for infringing its trade
            dress. Trade dress is protected under U.S. trademark law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the suit filed Jan. 23 in federal court in
            Santa Ana, California, Amloid Corp. of Denville, New Jersey, is
            accused of producing a line of construction toys that are
            confusingly similar to Mega's Mega Blocks toy line. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Montreal-based toymaker says in its pleadings that
            Amloid's Big Blocks toy line is too similar to the MEGA products
            in terms of the configuration of the blocks, the packaging and
            some of the construction toys that are to be used with the
            blocks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mega claims that the infringement is intentional, will
            cause consumer confusion, and that the lookalike products will
            harm its own reputation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company asked the court to bar further infringement,
            and an order for the destruction of all infringing products,
            packaging and promotional material, and for awards of money
            damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. Mega is also
            requesting additional damages to punish Amloid for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amloid didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request
            for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Mega Brands Inc. (MB) v. Amloid Corp., 8:13-cv-
            00108-CJC-MLG, U.S. District Court, Central District of
            California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Sues Electronic-Products Recycler for Infringement &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world's largest software company, sued
            a company that offers electronic-equipment recycling for
            copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Jan. 25 in federal court
            in Arizona, E-Waste Harvesters Inc. is accused of advertising
            and selling computers with unauthorized copies of Microsoft
            software installed. The Redmond, California-based software
            company said that the sales have continued even after it warned
            E-Waste Harvesters of the consequences of its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In addition to copyright infringement, Microsoft also
            accused Phoenix-based E-Waste Harvesters of infringing
            trademarks and of using false representations of the software
            company's packaging. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The public is likely to be confused by E-Waste Harvester's
            actions, and to assume falsely that the software company has
            authorized the use of its copyrighted material and trademarks,
            Microsoft claims. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It asked the court to order the Arizona company to halt its
            allegedly infringing activities, and to order the seizure of all
            infringing products in E-Waste Harvesters' possession. Microsoft
            has requested awards of money damages, profits derived from the
            infringing actions, attorney fees and litigation costs. It also
            asked for a tripling of the damages and profits awards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;E-Waste Harvesters didn't respond immediately to an
            e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. E-Waste Harvesters Inc.,
            2:13-cv-00169-DKD, U.S. District Court, District of Arizona
            (Phoenix) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Life of Pi' Tops List of Films Most Illegally Downloaded &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If the number of unauthorized downloads of a movie were an
            indication of which film would win the best-picture Academy
            Award, 'Life of Pi,' would win, according to a chart posted on
            the TorrentFreak anti-copyright news website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Second place goes to 'Silver Linings Playbook,' followed
            in order by 'Skyfall,' 'Django Unchained,' and 'Argo.' The
            movies were downloaded through the use of the BitTorrent file-
            sharing protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Academy Awards ceremony will be held Feb. 24 in Los
            Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Colombian Constitutional Court Rejects New Copyright Law &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Colombia's copyright law was ruled unconstitutional by the
            nation's constitutional court, according to Columbia Reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The law had been passed as part of the free trade agreement
            between the U.S. and Colombia that went into effect last year,
            according to the Colombia Reports website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court agreed with Colombian Senator Jorge Robledo, who
            had argued against the law, saying it unfairly limited Internet
            users' rights to have access to and share information, the
            website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Antigua Given WTO Approval to Suspend IP Treaty Obligations &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The World Trade Organization has granted Antigua and
            Barbados authorization to suspend treaty obligations it has with
            the U.S. related to intellectual property rights. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to a statement posted on the island nation's
            website yesterday, the remedy, 'contrary to what the United
            States has publicly stated, will not constitute 'piracy' or
            theft of intellectual property rights.' The government went on
            to say that it has tried for almost a decade to resolve a
            dispute with the U.S. with respect to what it calls 'remote
            gaming.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Actions by the U.S. to block U.S. residents access to the
            online gambling websites in Antigua 'has resulted in the loss
            of thousands of good paying jobs and seizure by the Americans of
            billions of dollars belonging to gaming operators and their
            customers in financial institutions across the world,'
            according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The online gambling industry was at one point the second-
            largest employer in Antigua, which was worth 'over $3.4 billion
            to the Antiguan economy,' the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative responded to
            the news of the WTO actions. USTR spokesman Sean Spicer said in
            a statement that the U.S. is presently 'engaged in compensation
            negotiations with Antigua and six other WTO members that have
            claimed to be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said that once the process of 'clarifying the U.S.
            schedule of commitments is completed,' the issues of the
            nation's dispute with Antigua will be moot and there will no
            longer be any basis for suspending WTO commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The WTO had previously found that the U.S. gambling laws
            related to Internet gambling on horse racing weren't in
            compliance with treaty obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. had taken exception to the $3.4 billion figure put
            forth by Antigua. According to the USTR statement, that amount
            is more than three times the size of Antigua's entire economy. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>New Microsoft Office Takes to the Cloud: Rich Jaroslovsky</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;It'll take more than an Excel
            spreadsheet to help you figure out the latest version of
            Microsoft (MSFT) Office. Maybe a degree from the London School of
            Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's been awhile since a new version of Office stirred a
            lot of excitement. So much has already been built into the
            world's most popular productivity suite over the years that it's
            hard to get too worked up over new features. Threaded comments
            in Word! Recommended PivotTables in Excel! &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Still, the new Office is worth paying attention to for a
            couple of reasons. It's the first one designed for use in the
            era of cloud-connected devices, touchscreens and tablets. And
            Microsoft is radically changing how it's priced and sold to
            consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The cloud -- in this case, Microsoft's Office.com website
            and SkyDrive service -- is integral to the new offering. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Facing a threat from Google (GOOG)'s online suite of productivity
            applications, Microsoft has adopted a hybrid model. Unlike the
            Google Docs approach, major Office components are still
            installed locally on your computer, giving you full access and
            flexibility even when you are offline. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If you're signed into Office.com, your files, formatting
            and preferred settings will be seamlessly saved to SkyDrive,
            giving you access to your work even if you're signing in from
            another computer -- or a Windows Phone, for that matter. If
            you're not online, changes you make locally to a file will be
            automatically synced the next time you connect. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>NFL Creates Digital Video Service With Microsoft Among Partners</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The National Football League is
            creating a personalized video service to take advantage of what
            one of its executives called a 'borderline insatiable'
            appetite for its content. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;NFL Now will begin this summer, said Brian Rolapp, the
            league's executive vice president of Media. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The appetite for NFL content is borderline insatiable,'
            Rolapp said during a press conference in New York, across the
            Hudson River from where the league will stage its first outdoor,
            cold-weather Super Bowl on Feb. 2 in East Rutherford, New
            Jersey. 'Mobile advertising is not the biggest revenue stream,
            but it certainly is the fastest growing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO),
            and Proctor Gamble Co. (PG)'s Gillette are initial launch partners
            for the digital service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The NFL has always focused on reaching as many fans as
            possible -- wherever they are,' Commissioner Roger Goodell
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The NFL is the most-watched U.S. sports league, generating
            about $10 billion in annual revenue last season. According to
            the league, 205 million people tuned into games this past
            season, and 34 of the 35 most-watched shows in the fall season
            were NFL games. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Our fans can't get enough of our content,' said Jonathan Kraft, part owner of the New England
            Patriots and co-chair of
            the league's Digital Media Committee. 'More and more they are
            living their lives on a tablet, on a phone.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The league said that 60 percent of digital consumption
            occurs from Tuesday-Saturday with the remaining 40 percent
            Sunday and Monday, when a majority of games are played. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Dual Revenue &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The venture will be supported by a dual revenue stream,
            including advertising, Rolapp said. Additionally, while much of
            the content will be free, there will be a subscription component
            for premium content. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What we hear from advertisers -- we want mobile, we want
            video,' Rolapp said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Users can indicate their favorite team or fantasy players
            and the content stream will personalize each user's feed. The
            content will be created by the NFL specifically for mobile
            devices instead of repackaged video from television broadcasts,
            Rolapp said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Paul Allen's Seahawks Beat Microsoft as an Investment</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Even if the Seattle Seahawks lose to the Denver Broncos in Sunday's Super Bowl, the team has
            rewarded owner Paul Allen -- by beating his old company, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), as an investment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allen bought the pro football team as a favor to his native city in 1997, when his heart was in
            basketball and his investing firepower was focused on a heady concept he called the 'wired world.' The
            too-early bet on the convergence of television and the Internet flopped, losing him more than $8 billion.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with Microsoft searching for direction, Allen's investments have recovered from
            that rocky stretch thanks in part to the football team he once said he purchased out of 'civic duty.' The
            Seahawks, buoyed by TV broadcast fees, are worth about six times what Allen paid. In the same period,
            Microsoft shares have a little more than doubled as the Redmond, Washington-based company struggled to make
            its software relevant to mobile phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team's success has rewarded
            Allen, 61, in other ways, showering the programmer and librarian's son with affection in a city mad for the
            Seahawks. Pike Place Market florists sell roses dyed in team colors of blue and green. The '12th Man' flags
            honoring the city's famously loud fans adorn lawns, offices and the Space Needle. The crowd cheered Allen at
            a Jan. 19 playoff game when he raised one of the pennants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This 12th Man thing is
            everywhere,' Bill Gates, the Seattle high school friend who co-founded Microsoft with Allen in 1975, said
            after appearing on Bloomberg TV in New York last week. 'The whole city is pretty energized.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft
            Stake &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, by measures other than the simple change in value, Microsoft performs
            better. While a sports franchise isn't a liquid investment, Allen has been able to whittle his 28 percent
            Microsoft stake to less than 2 percent, collecting more than $20 billion along the way. He still holds about
            100 million shares, which have earned him $800 million in dividends after taxes in the past decade,
            according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes called Microsoft's 'other'
            founder, Allen published a 2011 memoir, 'Idea Man,' detailing his productive and at times contentious
            relationship with Gates. Money hasn't been everything to him, post-Microsoft. After a brush with Hodgkin's
            disease led him to leave in 1983, he started using his wealth for 'a life of adventure and discovery,' as a
            website promoting the book put it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Electric Guitar &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;He travels on
            his helipad-equipped yacht to Antarctica, plays electric guitar in all-star bands with famous friends
            including Dan Aykroyd and collects Impressionist art. The Seahawks aren't his only pro team; he acquired
            what he called his 'first love,' the Portland Trail Blazers basketball franchise, in 1988. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When
            his failed investments in cable and technology businesses helped shrink a $36 billion fortune by more than
            half, Allen a decade ago brought in a new team of professional money managers who diversified into such
            areas as real estate, insurance and energy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For one of the technology visionaries of the
            20th century, low-tech investments led a turnaround. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vulcan Inc., Allen's Seattle
            investment firm, has remade a onetime warehouse district north of downtown into a destination neighborhood
            of shops, restaurants and offices anchored by Amazon.com Inc. The online retailer agreed to pay Vulcan $1.16
            billion for an 11-building campus in the South Lake Union neighborhood in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bakken
            Investment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Allen, through Vulcan, was the only individual investor in a KKR
            Co.-led syndicate that paid $7.2 billion for most of Samson Investment Co., an oil and natural gas producer
            with interests in more than 7,600 wells, including North Dakota's Bakken region. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That
            same year, Vulcan scored a $1 billion gain on an investment in Plains All American Pipeline LP, a
            Houston-based pipeline operator. Vulcan also has an investment in Driven Brands Inc., a Charlotte, North
            Carolina company that includes the Maaco collision-repair chain, Meineke Car Care Centers and Econo Lube N'
            Tune Brakes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allen declined to comment for this article. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            billionaire also uses his fortune to back research in fields that fascinate him. In September he founded the
            Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which will try to develop machines that can field user
            questions and discuss them in natural language -- something like Captain Kirk's computer in the 'Star Trek'
            TV show. He's already committed $500 million to another Seattle lab called the Allen Institute for Brain
            Science, where researchers are trying to determine which genes are most important for the workings of the
            brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Net Worth &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's a real passion for understanding how
            intelligence works, from the biological perspective as well as the computer perspective,' said Matt
            McIlwain, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle firm that has invested alongside Vulcan.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allen's net worth, which was $12.4 billion in 2003, has recovered to $15.7 billion,
            ranking him among the world's 60 wealthiest, according to the Bloomberg ranking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He
            didn't set out to buy the Seahawks, considered by odds makers a slight underdog to the Broncos in the Feb. 2
            Super Bowl. Local politicians approached Allen to buy the team when it threatened to move to California. He
            paid $194 million for the franchise and contributed another $130 million toward construction of a new
            stadium in Seattle. The team is now worth $1.25 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Asset a 'Jewel' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a jewel of an asset,' said Steve Patterson, athletic
            director at the University of Texas and previously a sports business consultant to National Football League
            owners, including Allen. Patterson was also general manager of the Trail Blazers from 2003 to 2007. While
            Seattle is only the 13th-largest media market, the Seahawks draw fan support from Portland and other Pacific
            Northwest cities, making it more like No. 4, Patterson said. They've even drawn the loyalty of fans across
            the border in Vancouver. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For all of Allen's Seahawks success, pro football isn't a
            sure-fire bet, especially because of growing awareness of the dangers of concussions, said New York sports
            media consultant Chris Bevilacqua. A federal judge this month denied approval of the NFL's $914 million
            settlement of a lawsuit brought by more than 5,000 former players, saying it may be insufficient to cover
            all future concussion claims. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There are risks and rewards across the marketplace, and
            that's one of the risks,' Bevilacqua said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The connection hasn't escaped Allen, whose
            family foundation said in November that it's spending $2.4 million for researchers at his brain lab and the
            University of Washington to study how blows to the head can damage the brain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Google's Moto Sale Casts Doubts on Microsoft's Nokia Plan</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)'s sale of Motorola Mobility holds a clear lesson for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s
            acquisition of another smartphone maker, Nokia Oyj (NOK1V): Be a hardware or software company, not both.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)'s purchase of Motorola's consumer-hardware business, which
            Google bought two years ago for $12.4 billion including patents, lets the search company refocus on software
            and exit competition with other manufacturers of smartphones based on its Android software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            is on track to close its $7.4 billion acquisition of Nokia's handset business this quarter, seeking to
            regain lost ground in a market where its 3.7 percent share is eclipsed by Android and Apple Inc.'s iPhone.
            Unless Microsoft can combine software and hardware as expertly as Apple has done with its products, the
            software maker will be better off without Nokia, according to Michael Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There's no point in having a
            hardware unit inside a software company unless you marry the two the way Apple does,' Cusumano said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While scrapping the Nokia deal isn't a likely prospect right now, Cusumano said it could happen
            later. Microsoft, which is in the middle of a search for a new chief executive officer, has staked its
            future as a devices and services company. Steve Ballmer, who is retiring as CEO once his successor takes
            over, reorganized the Redmond, Washington-based company around the strategy last year and sealed the Nokia
            deal in September to accelerate the transition. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            So far, Microsoft's plan is to continue with the path that Google tried with Motorola, selling hardware that
            competes with software sold to rival manufacturers. Close

        <headline>Microsoft Investors Say Nadella Safe Pick, Glad Search Ends</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The most exciting part of elevating Satya Nadella to chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp. may
            be that it would end the search to replace Steve Ballmer, investors in the world's biggest software maker
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 46-year-old native of Hyderabad, India, is a cloud computing whiz with the
            potential to reverse Microsoft's image as a company stranded in the past, said Chad Morganlander, a fund
            manager at Washington Crossing Advisors. At the same time, he spent two decades working for Ballmer and Bill
            Gates and shareholders may be disappointed no outside candidate was found, said Donald Selkin of National
            Securities Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's board is preparing to make Nadella, the company's
            enterprise and cloud chief, its CEO, and is discussing replacing Gates as chairman, according to people
            briefed on the process who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Microsoft spokesman
            Frank Shaw declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a safe choice,' said Kevin Walkush, a business
            analyst at Jensen Investment Management in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The firm oversees $7.2 billion and has 6.7
            million Microsoft shares. 'There's a large faction that wants a disruptive tech visionary to take over
            Microsoft and that group will probably be disappointed. Another group of people think we need a person like
            Satya who knows the business because it's so complex and needs someone that has the inside knowledge.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Seen Testing Insider Nadella's Will to Revamp</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;When asked last month what kinds of gadget gifts he would be getting for Christmas, Microsoft
            Corp.'s Satya Nadella, said to be the board's pick for chief executive officer, had an easy answer:
            Microsoft devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, 46, in an interview at a technology conference in Paris,
            said he had already gotten a new Xbox One game console for his children that he uses to watch movies through
            Netflix Inc. The India-born executive said he also has a phone made by Nokia Oyj -- a business that
            Microsoft is buying -- with a 41 megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His task as CEO will be winning over
            the legions of consumers who are far less enthused about buying Microsoft products. Taking over for Steve
            Ballmer, Nadella would inherit a company that has been left behind in smartphones, tablets and on the Web
            and one that's racing to transform from its software roots to be a leader in hardware and Internet services.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella can draw on 22 years of experience at the Redmond, Washington-based company in
            roles including head of the enterprise and cloud unit. He will also need to win over skeptics concerned that
            an insider can't move fast enough to make Microsoft a contender again in markets led by Apple Inc., Google
            Inc. and others, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets Co. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Zynga Said to Hire Microsoft's Entertainment Chief</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) is hiring Don Mattrick, the former head of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s entertainment
            division, as its new chief executive officer, seeking to reignite growth at the game developer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mattrick will succeed Mark Pincus, who will remain chairman of the board and chief product officer,
            Zynga said in a statement today. Mattrick, who will also join the board, starts July 8, the company said.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mattrick faces the challenge of turning around Zynga, which is suffering amid rising
            competition from upstarts such as King.com as well as a shift toward gaming on handheld devices. His
            experience in the industry, which includes stints at Microsoft and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA), may help San
            Francisco-based Zynga find new lines of revenue outside of Facebook Inc. (FB), where it is losing users,
            according to Michael Hickey, an analyst at National Alliance Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It does
            potentially demonstrate that he believes they have a compelling growth profile,' Denver-based Hickey said in
            an interview. 'He also adds credibility to an executive team that has been significantly compromised after
            their core Facebook business has deteriorated.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pincus will take a diminished role at
            the company he founded, a sign that his hard-charging management style and negotiating prowess -- once
            described by Google Inc. (GOOG) Chairman Eric Schmidt as 'fearsome' -- may have clashed with the needs of a
            large, publicly traded business. &lt;/p&gt;

            sales of its Surface tablet, will begin selling the devices to

            Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS) and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Co.
            are among those who have signed up, Microsoft said in a blog

            would sell 2 million units in the December quarter alone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company had expected greater initial sales as well.
            While Microsoft didn't give a forecast and hasn't disclosed how
            many Surface units have been sold, the company placed an initial
            order for 3 million devices from the manufacturer, people
            familiar with the matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's left Microsoft struggling to find groups and types
            of customer who may be ripe targets for Surface. Last month the
            company announced a price cut to $199 from a $499 starting price
            for schools purchasing the Surface RT model directly from
            Microsoft. That offer runs until the end of August and is
            available in 26 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Until now Surface has been sold only in retail stores and
            apps have focused on consumers and individual business users
            rather than corporate programs, making the device less appealing
            for wide-scale company use and harder to purchase if a
            corporation wanted a large number. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>We're No. 3! BlackBerry's Stumble Gives Microsoft a Leg Up in Smartphones</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Companies usually don't aspire to be in third place. But in the competitive smartphone market,
            Microsoft will happily occupy that spot instead of BlackBerry, which is stumbling with its new touch-screen
            handset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my colleague Peter Burrows reported, Google and Apple's dominant positions in
            the mobile market have left corporate IT departments wondering which company -- BlackBerry or Microsoft --
            will be the third option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question may have been answered last week, when Waterloo,
            Ontario-based BlackBerry disclosed weaker-than-expected sales of the Z10. The new model was designed to take
            on high-end devices such as the iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S4, which runs on Google's Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete
            Devenyi, senior vice president of enterprise software for BlackBerry, said corporate adoption of software
            for managing BlackBerry phones has been "very much in accordance with our expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BlackBerry's
            latest struggles boost the likelihood of Microsoft's Windows Phone becoming a credible third alternative,
            according to Bob Tinker, CEO of MobileIron, which makes smartphone-management software used by 5,000
            companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Most of our customers have been planning to support three mobile operating
            systems -- iOS, Android and either Windows Phone or BlackBerry,' Tinker said. 'The recent results indicate
            that BlackBerry is not going to be the third.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the bronze medal never
            looked so good.&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Taxes Said to Face Scrutiny as EU Quizzes Luxembourg</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's biggest
            software maker, is among companies embroiled in a European Union
            inquiry into Luxembourg's tax treatment of multinational firms,
            according to three people familiar with the EU's review. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Commission has quizzed Luxembourg about how it
            taxes Microsoft's intellectual property, said one of the people,
            who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
            Competition regulators also asked questions about McDonald's
            Corp. (MCD)'s taxes in Luxembourg, two of the people said. Amazon.com
            Inc.'s tax affairs there are also being looked at, the Financial
            Times reported yesterday, citing an EU official. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Amid a global crackdown on tax avoidance, EU competition
            regulators last month opened a probe into suspected tax breaks
            for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in Ireland, Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) in the Netherlands
            and Fiat Finance Trade SA in Luxembourg, the bloc's richest
            country in per capita terms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are in constant contact with the European Commission
            on all these tax issues and Luxembourg is pretty confident in
            the way it handles its taxation issues and so we're going to
            monitor the information with the commission and hand over the
            information that is requested,' Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg
            Finance Minister, said today on CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The scrutiny of Luxembourg is also a potential
            embarrassment for Jean-Claude Juncker, who is primed to become
            the next president of the commission -- the EU's executive arm
            in charge of the investigation. Juncker, who led Luxembourg
            until last year, helped the country win a reputation as an
            attractive location for international companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Member States &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The commission continues to gather information about
            certain tax practices in several member states,' Antoine Colombani, spokesman for Competition Commissioner
            Joaquin Almunia, said. 'However we will not make any comment on whether
            specific companies may or may not be covered by this information
            gathering exercise.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sabina Gockel, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Brussels,
            declined to comment. Joanna Kwiatkowska, a spokeswoman for
            McDonald's in the U.K., didn't immediately respond to calls and
            an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Natasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for Juncker at the
            commission, said the former Luxembourg premier also has no
            comment. Lawmakers at the European Parliament are scheduled to
            vote on his appointment later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lucien Michels, a spokesman for Luxembourg's finance
            ministry, declined to comment on Amazon's possible involvement
            in the tax inquiry. He didn't immediately respond to e-mailed
            questions concerning other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;French Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;McDonald's denied earlier this year a magazine report that
            it avoided paying taxes related to more than $3 billion of
            revenue in France since 2009, saying inspections by fiscal
            authorities at its French unit were routine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU's investigations of Apple, Starbucks and Fiat
            Finance focus on so-called transfer-pricing arrangements on
            taxing commercial transactions between company units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission has said it will continue a wider inquiry
            into those deals, including information gathering from the U.K.,
            Belgium, Cyprus and Malta. Governments can be ordered by the
            European Commission to claw back unfair aid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU has also sought details from Belgium, Spain, France,
            Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the U.K., Cyprus and Malta
            on so-called patent boxes, which allow tax reductions on income
            from patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EU request for information on Amazon relates to whether
            Luxembourg's tax decisions on the company complied with state-aid rules, the FT said. Amazon's press office
            in the U.K. didn't
            respond to a call for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A seventh Chinese national was
            indicted in a trade-secrets case involving the theft of
            genetically modified corn seed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mo Yun is accused of conspiring to steal trade secrets from
            2007 to 2013, U.S. prosecutors in Des Moines, Iowa, said in a
            July 2 statement. She is married to Shao Genhuou, chairman of
            Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co. (002385), and is the sister of Mo
            Hailong, an employee of the Chinese company who was indicted
            with five others in December. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;They are accused of stealing the seeds belonging to
            Monsanto Co. (MON), DuPont Co.'s Pioneer Hi-Bred unit, and AG Reliant
            Genetics LLC's LG Seeds unit from production fields in Iowa and
            Illinois in order to ship them to Kings Nower Seed, a unit of
            the Chinese company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mo Hailong was arrested after he was found digging in an
            Iowa cornfield, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Yun, 14-mj-00160, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of Iowa (Des Moines). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Collegium Gets Patent on Abuse-Prevention Drug Formulation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc., a Massachusetts-based
            pharmaceutical company, received a patent on a drug formulation
            aimed at preventing abuse of some drugs, such as opioids. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Opioid abuse is a growing problem and efforts to design
            abuse-resistant or abuse-deterrent formulations have been
            largely unsuccessful, the company said in the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patent 8,758,813, issued June 24, covers a formulation that
            prevents the immediate release of a substantial portion of the
            drug, even if the tablet is crushed or chopped, with the
            resulting material placed in water, snorted or swallowed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is accomplished by bonding the drug to fatty acids
            that constitute as much as 15 times the molecular weight of the
            active ingredient or by dispersing the drug within
            microparticles composed of a material that is either slowly
            soluble or insoluble in water. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Collegium applied for the patent in April 2013 with help
            from San Francisco's Cooley LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft, Canon Agree to Cross-License Patent Portfolios &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Canon Inc. (7751) agreed to cross-license
            patent portfolios, according to a joint company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Products and services covered by the patents include
            digital imaging and mobile consumer products, the companies
            said. They didn't disclose financial terms of the agreement or
            specify which patents are included. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said that since its
            licensing program began in 2003, the software company has
            entered into more than 1,200 licensing agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;BP Fails in Attempt to Register Green Color as Aussie Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/), the British oil company, cannot register a
            particular color of green as a trademark in Australia, the
            U.K.'s Guardian newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;IP Australia said the oil company failed to provide
            convincing evidence that the average gas purchaser would
            inevitably link the company to a color of green known as Pantone
            348C, according to the Guardian. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company had attempted to register the color as an
            Australian trademark since 1991, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Elan-Polo, Adidas Settle Dispute Over Shoe-Design Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elan-Polo Inc., a Missouri-based shoe and clothing
            designer, settled a trademark lawsuit against Germany's Adidas
            AG (ADS) for undisclosed terms, according to a July 1 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The designer sued in federal court in St. Louis in November
            seeking a declaration that a shoe design it created for Wal-Mart
            Stores Inc. (WMT) didn't infringe Adidas's three-stripe trademark for
            shoes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elan-Polo said although it had contractually indemnified
            Wal-Mart for infringement claims against the shoe design, Adidas
            demanded that the retailer stop selling the shoe and pay
            damages. Adidas also filed infringement claims against Elan-Polo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Elan-Polo v. Adidas America Inc., 13-cv-02322,
            U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St. Louis). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;World Cup Copyright Enforcement Most Successful Through Facebook &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Orange SA (ORA)'s Viaccess-Orca unit, a content-protection
            company, has sent out 2,000 takedown notices to platforms
            hosting or linking to World Cup games streamed without
            authorization, the TorrentFreak anti-copyright news website
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Leporini, executive vice president of marketing for
            Viaccess-Orca, told TorrentFreak that his company managed to get
            about 35 percent of the streaming links disabled before a
            particular World Cup game ends. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said it was most successful taking down
            unauthorized links to streaming game content that had been
            posted on Facebook Inc., with a 51 percent rate of link removal,
            according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;FIFA, professional soccer's governing body, previously
            contacted some website operators requesting that infringing
            content be removed as soon as possible, according to
            TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Zynga's Mattrick Looked to Buy Company While at Microsoft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Don Mattrick, the former head of
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s entertainment division who takes the reins as
            chief executive officer of Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) today, has been hankering
            to run all or part of the social-gaming company for at least
            three years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In 2010, Mattrick negotiated with Zynga founder Mark Pincus
            about buying the maker of such popular games as 'FarmVille,'
            according to people with knowledge of the matter. The idea was
            to bolster Microsoft's Xbox lineup with social games that then
            were adding millions of users on Facebook Inc. (FB)'s network each
            week. The discussions ultimately fell apart, said the people,
            who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Now, Mattrick, 49, is taking over Zynga from Pincus after
            the company lost its spot as the top game maker on Facebook to
            King.com. Its games have lost steam even as the social network's
            membership has swelled, and players are shifting to mobile apps
            played on smartphones and tablets. Zynga is also grappling with
            a talent drain, a stock price that has plunged around 66 percent
            since a December 2011 initial public offering, and an ownership
            structure that ensures Pincus will continue having the final say
            even as he cedes the top job. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Nadella Outlines Vision With More Overhauls</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Satya Nadella
            unveiled his first vision statement as chief executive officer,
            saying that more engineering and organizational changes are
            needed as he attempts to turn around the software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've got to back it up with products people love and
            that's what we're galvanizing to do,' Nadella said in an
            interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CEO didn't address the prospect of job cuts, yet people
            familiar with the company's plans said reductions will probably
            happen. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is shifting its
            focus from the devices and services strategy that former CEO
            Steve Ballmer reorganized the company around last July and is
            homing in more on productivity, mobile and cloud, Nadella wrote
            in the memo today that was distributed to employees and posted
            on the company's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over the course of July, the senior leadership team and I
            will share more on the engineering and organization changes we
            believe are needed,' Nadella wrote. 'Nothing is off the table
            in how we think about shifting our culture.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The memo is Nadella's most comprehensive statement about
            Microsoft's direction since he was appointed CEO in February.
            Since then, he has made several appearances at company and
            technology events to discuss the priorities of mobile and cloud
            products, as he works to shift Microsoft away from its longtime
            core business of software for personal computers. Nadella has
            signaled a desire to produce software for rival operating
            systems like Apple Inc.'s iOS and Google Inc.'s Android and has
            shuffled management in areas like marketing, business
            development and the Xbox game console. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Revamps Business Units Playing Catchup on Web</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer unveiled his biggest reorganization
            since 2002 to speed development of hardware and services at a company plagued by anemic growth and
            competition in mobile computing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The software maker reduced the number of business units
            to four and said Windows chief Julie Larson-Green will oversee all hardware, including the Surface tablet
            and Xbox console and related games. Windows Phone software head Terry Myerson will add responsibility for
            the Windows and Xbox operating systems. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer is concentrating divisions around
            hardware and Internet services to appeal to customers who increasingly use mobile devices for tasks once
            done on desktop machines. As demand for Microsoft's flagship Windows software ebbs amid a global
            personal-computer slump, Ballmer needs to slice away management layers that have hampered product
            development. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'First and foremost this is an attempt to address the fact that they are
            behind in tablet and mobile,' said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. 'They're
            effectively saying, 'We have some problems we need to address and we need to make radical changes to
            accomplish it.'' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 2.8 percent to $35.69 in New York, the highest closing
            price since 2007. The stock has gained 34 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent gain for the
            Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) filed a lawsuit
            today accusing U.S. Customs officials of refusing to follow a
            trade agency's order to block imports of phones made by Google
            Inc. (GOOG)'s Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington
            issued the import ban in May 2012 after deciding that Motorola
            Mobility devices infringed a Microsoft patent for a way mobile
            phones synchronize calendar events with other computers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection, after having secret
            meetings with Google, continued to let the Motorola Mobility
            mobile phones enter the country even though Google has done
            nothing to remove the feature at the heart of the ITC case,
            Microsoft said in the complaint. The case illustrates what
            Lexmark International Inc. and Lutron Electronics Co. in May
            called an 'increasingly ineffective and unpredictable
            enforcement' of import bans imposed by the trade agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Customs has a clear responsibility to carry out ITC
            decisions, which are reached after a full trial and rigorous
            legal review,' Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard
            said in a statement. 'Here Customs repeatedly ignored its
            obligation and did so based on secret discussions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) accused U.S. Customs
            officials of refusing to follow a trade agency's order to block
            imports of phones made by Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Motorola Mobility unit
            in a lawsuit that seeks to alter how such cases are handled. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington

            Microsoft's lawsuit, filed yesterday in Washington, says that
            order isn't being enforced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection, after having secret

        <headline>Bodyslams at Microsoft Prepared Larson-Green for Overhaul</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Julie Larson-Green body-slammed a 6-foot-6 colleague who was blocking her
            exit one day in 2001 when the largest earthquake to hit Washington state in a half century rattled her
            office. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'When I have a direction I want to go, it doesn't matter who's in my way,' said
            Larson-Green, 51, who started at Microsoft 20 years ago and is the company's highest-ranking female
            engineering executive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green's obstacles are about to get bigger, now that she's
            been put in charge of all hardware at the world's largest software company. As head of the devices and
            studio engineering group, she is responsible for Microsoft's push into gadgets such as tablets, which so far
            is faltering as consumers and businesses shun the company's nine-month-old Surface computer in favor of the
            iPad from Apple Inc. and mobile machines from Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Larson-Green is at
            the center of a sweeping overhaul by Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, unveiled yesterday,
            which is intended to streamline management and rev up growth in areas like mobile devices. The task is
            urgent as Microsoft, with its Office and Windows software products dominant on personal computers, deals
            with a PC slump caused by consumers' increasing preference for mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. filed a lawsuit July
            12 accusing U.S. Customs officials of refusing to follow a trade
            agency's order to block imports of phones made by Google Inc.'s
            Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington
            issued the import ban in May 2012 after deciding that Motorola
            Mobility devices infringed a Microsoft patent for a way mobile
            phones synchronize calendar events with other computers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Customs and Border Protection, after secret meetings
            with Google, continued to let the Motorola Mobility phones enter
            the country even though Google has done nothing to remove the
            feature at the heart of the ITC case, Microsoft said in its
            complaint. The case illustrates what Lexmark International Inc. (LXK)
            and Lutron Electronics Co. in May called 'increasingly
            ineffective and unpredictable enforcement' of import bans
            imposed by the trade agency. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility convinced the agency that the order
            didn't apply to syncing through Google rather than Microsoft
            servers, and to give it a grace period to allow changes to take
            effect. Both of those requests had previously been rejected by
            the ITC, according to Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ITC order is in effect until Microsoft's patent expires
            in April 2018. An appeal in the case is scheduled to be heard
            Aug. 6 in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Meetings between Mountain View, California-based Google and
            Customs were held in secret in April, with Microsoft not privy
            to their existence until after the Customs decision June 24
            allowing the continued importation of the phones, according to
            Microsoft's filings asking the court to halt the Motorola
            Mobility shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ITC's job is to protect U.S. markets from unfair
            competition, including infringement of patents or theft of trade
            secrets. It has become a key forum for disputes between
            smartphone makers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Once the import bans are ordered, it's common for both
            patent owners and importers to lobby Customs and neither side is
            told what the other is saying for fear of exposing trade
            secrets, lawyers involved in ITC cases said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trade agency is compiling information on how well its
            orders are being enforced and President Barack Obama last month
            called for a review of procedures within the ITC and Customs. In
            their joint letter to the ITC, Lexmark and Lutron said the
            'current problems with enforcement of orders requires immediate
            attention.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) v. Department of Homeland
            Security, 13-cv-01063, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
            (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Faro, Nikon Metrology Settle Suit Over Scanning Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Faro Technologies Inc. (FARO) and Nikon Metrology NV settled a
            five-year-old lawsuit over two patents related to scanning
            apparatus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suit was filed by Nikon Metrology, formerly Metris USA
            Inc., in July 2009. The companies compete in the business of
            computer-aided three-dimensional measurement technology. In a
            July 12 filing in federal court in Boston, Faro said it reached
            a settlement with Nikon Metrology and withdrew its motion for
            attorney fees. No other details were given &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In August, a jury in Boston found that Lake Mary, Florida-based Faro hadn't infringed patent
            7,313,264. The court
            previously found, on a motion by Faro, that patent 6,611,617
            wasn't infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nikon Metrology, based in Leuven, Belgium, asked the court
            to overturn the verdict or grant a new trial. When both those
            requests were rejected, the company turned to the U.S. Court of
            Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the Washington-based court that
            hears appeals of patent disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Faro said in a statement that the parties to the settlement
            agreement agreed to keep the terms confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Metris U.S.A. Inc. v. Faro Technologies, 08-cv-11187, U.S. District Court, District of
            Massachusetts
            (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) is challenging
            Luxembourg's M7 Group's use of 'Skylink' for its direct-to-home satellite television program in the Czech
            Republic and
            Slovakia, the Advanced Television news website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K.-based British Sky claims the term infringed its
            'sky' trademark used with its BSkyB TV services, according to
            Advanced Television. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier a U.K. court found that Microsoft Corp.'s use of
            'Skydrive' for its cloud storage system infringed British
            Sky's U.K. and European Union trademarks, the website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A spokesman for British Sky told Advanced Television that
            the Middlesex, U.K.-based company regarded any unauthorized use
            of 'Sky' as an infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai Seeks European Registration for 'Lost Swords' Mark &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai Holdings Inc. (7832)'s Namco Bandai Games unit has
            applied to register 'Lost Swords' as a trademark in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Japanese maker of computer games said in its
            application that the name would be used for video-game machines,
            amusement-park services, and games and related software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Among the games produced by the Tokyo-based company are
            Ultimate Ninja, Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures, Dark Souls
            and Armored Core Verdict Day. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company produces games for consoles produced by Sony
            Corp. (6758), Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp., as well as Apple Inc.'s
            iPhone and mobile phones using Google Inc.'s (GOOG) Android operating
            system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Orthodox Group Sues Israeli Company Over Use of Kosher Mark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations in America's OU
            Kashruth unit filed a trademark infringement suit against
            Israeli food manufacturer Better Different Ltd., Jewish
            Business News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suit, which was filed in Israel, claims that Better
            Different of Maale Edummim used the Union's trademark
            designating kosher food -- the letter U circled by the letter O
            -- without paying licensing fees, according to Jewish Business
            News. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Union said Better Different continued to use the mark
            during 2012 and 2013, Jewish Business News reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Union has asked the court to order the destruction of
            infringing packaging, the recall of products bearing the mark
            without authorization, licensing fees for the allegedly
            unauthorized use of the mark for the past three years and money
            damages, according to Jewish Business News. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Marilyn Monroe Photo Auction to Include Copyrights &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 3,700 unpublished black-and-white and color
            negatives and slides from photographer Milton H. Greene's images
            of the late Marilyn Monroe are going up for auction in Los
            Angeles on July 27, the Associated Press reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;What makes the auction unusual is that in addition to the
            images themselves, the copyrights are also being sold, making it
            possible for the buyer to create additional prints and sell or
            license them, AP said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greene shot more than 5,000 images of the actress, who died
            in August 1962. He didn't commercialize his work and only a
            handful of pictures were published in his lifetime, Joseph
            Madelena told AP. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madelena is the owner of Profiles in History, the auction
            house that is holding the sale, AP reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Vatican Should Use Creative Commons for Encyclical, Blogger Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A blogger who made downloadable copies of Pope Francis's
            recent encyclical -- 'Lumen Fides' -- available on his website
            is calling for new guidelines for the release of papal documents
            after being warned he was infringing the Vatican's copyright. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brandon Vogt, author of 'The Church and New Media:
            Blogging Converts, Online Activists, and Bishops Who Tweet,'
            put the text to the encyclical on BrandonVogt.com July 5, the
            date the Vatican released this papal letter to the Roman
            Catholic Church and to the world. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vogt had converted the text to multiple formats for
            downloading, including for Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPad, Amazon.com Inc.'s
            Kindle e-reader and Barnes Noble Inc. (BKS)'s Nook. The letter is
            unusual in that it's the work of both Pope Francis and his
            immediate predecessor, the recently retired Pope Benedict XVI. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vogt said that within hours he heard from both the U.S.
            Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Vatican, who accused him
            of violating 'both civil and moral law' and 'stealing from
            the pope.' They ordered him to remove the document from his
            blog immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a response on his blog, he said that while he was clear
            the Vatican and the bishops' conference weren't wrong to assert
            their copyright to the encyclical, there must be a better way to
            make the text available. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Vogt suggested that all such church documents be released
            under a Creative Commons license. That would protect the
            integrity of the document, while allowing people free access to
            share it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He said that under a Creative Commons license, people 'may

        <headline>Google and Microsoft Fight in Court, Friends in Congress</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Even as they battle in courts over smartphone and video technology, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and
            Google Inc. (GOOG) have discovered a common foe: patent owners who try to sue their customers or go after an
            entire industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both companies are seeking to curb the litigation practices of firms
            that buy patents with the sole purpose of demanding royalties from as many end-users as they can, even if it
            means suing a pizza parlor or non-profit. Anger has united a cross section of retailers, finance companies,
            public-transit operators and hotels, and even caught the attention of President Barack Obama, who last month
            announced corrective measures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Focusing on that core issue could create pressure in
            Congress for legislation and action by U.S. courts -- as long as companies avoid the squabbling that marred
            the previous effort to change patent law. That took almost a decade and pitted industries, and even
            technology companies, against each other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Going after bad litigation behavior is an
            approach we can all agree on,' said Tim Molino, director of government relations for Washington-based BSA -
            The Software Alliance, whose members include Microsoft and Oracle Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google spokesman
            Matt Kallman referred questions about patent legislation to the Coalition for Patent Fairness, a
            Washington-based lobbying group backed by Google, Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel Corp. Each month, the group
            has a meeting with an increasing number of organizations to discuss ways to get legislative change. &lt;/p&gt;

            Microsoft wants to curb the use of patents that relate to widely used technological standards, a key issue
            in its fight with Google over inventions used in its Xbox video-gaming system and Windows operating system.

        <headline>Romanian Prosecutors Open Probe of Microsoft Licenses</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Romanian anti-corruption prosecutors
            opened an investigation in connection with licenses acquired by
            the Romanian government from Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are questioning local Microsoft directors and
            current or former government officials about a $105 million
            contract to supply Microsoft Office licenses to Romanian schools
            and other institutions from 2004 to 2009, according to a
            statement on the prosecutors' office website. The probe is
            centered on whether accusations of influence peddling, bribery
            and abuse of office have merit and is not targeting specific
            individuals for now, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are clues that the price for the licenses was
            increased by about 5.4 million euros ($7.3 million),' the
            office said. Microsoft Romanian press office didn't respond to
            Bloomberg phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said last
            year that it's cooperating with U.S. federal authorities
            investigating possible illegal activity by employees and
            business partners in Russia and Pakistan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The statement followed a Wall Street Journal report that
            federal regulators are extending their examination of the
            company's relations with business partners who allegedly bribed
            foreign officials for contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The investigation had earlier looked into allegations made
            by a former Microsoft representative in China, and the company's
            relationships with resellers and consultants in Romania and
            Italy, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft to Announce Job Cuts as Soon as This Week</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is planning its biggest round of job cuts in five years, as the software
            maker looks to slim down and integrate Nokia Oyj's handset unit, people with knowledge of the company's
            plans said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said in an interview last week that he
            has preparing to make sweeping changes at Microsoft. The reductions will probably be in engineering,
            marketing and areas of overlap with Nokia, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans
            aren't public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The restructuring -- which may be unveiled as soon as this week -- may
            end up being the biggest in Microsoft history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, two of the people said.
            Some details are still being worked out, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Microsoft,
            Intel to Benefit as Businesses Upgrade PCs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadella, who took over from Steve Ballmer in
            February, said in the interview that Microsoft would have to become more focused and efficient. The CEO
            issued his first company mission statement last week, calling for greater emphasis on mobile devices,
            cloud-computing and productivity software as consumers and businesses buy fewer personal computers to check
            e-mail, browse the Web and access data and software. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>EDF Buys Illinois Wind Farm With Microsoft Power Contract</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A U.S. unit of French utility
            Electricite de France SA bought most of an Illinois wind farm
            that will sell power to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EDF Renewable Energy bought a 96 percent stake in the 175-megawatt Pilot Hill Wind Project from
            Orion Energy Group LLC and
            Vision Energy LLC that's under construction 60 miles (97
            kilometers) southwest of Chicago, the San Diego-based company
            said today in a statement. Terms weren't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The project will power Microsoft's Chicago data center and
            reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by displacing electricity
            generated from conventional sources such as coal and natural
            gas, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pilot Hill, formerly known as K4 Wind Farm, is expected to
            be completed in the first quarter. It will use General Electric
            Co. and Vestas Wind Systems A/S turbines. Microsoft has another
            20-year contract for the output of the 110-megawatt Keechi Wind
            Project in Texas that's also slated for completion next year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft, Intel to Benefit as Businesses Upgrade PCs</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The personal-computer industry showed signs of improvement last quarter as businesses bought enough
            machines to revive sales growth at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and fuel Intel Corp. (INTC)'s biggest revenue gain
            in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel's sales increased 7 percent in the quarter that ended in
            June, according to the average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft is likely to report
            that revenue rose 10 percent after stagnating the previous period, the projections show. The software maker
            may also announce job cuts related to the acquisition of Nokia Oyj's handset unit, people with knowledge of
            the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Corporations are replacing older computers at a faster clip,
            spurring a 6.9 percent increase in U.S. PC unit sales last quarter, according to researcher IDC. That's good
            news for Intel, Microsoft and other companies that rely on demand for PCs and have been slow to adapt to the
            shift toward mobile devices and software delivered via the Internet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A lot of the
            growth is in big companies,' said Loren Loverde, who heads PC market research at IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel
            releases results today, while Microsoft will report earnings on July 22. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The smartphone
            boom, meantime, is benefiting Apple Inc. (AAPL), the largest U.S. maker of these handheld computing devices,
            as well as Facebook Inc. and Twitter (TWTR) Inc., which make money from ads shown to users of mobile
            gadgets. Apple will probably report a 7 percent increase in sales, analysts predict. Revenue probably rose
            55 percent at Facebook and may have more than doubled at Twitter, according to the projections. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Semiconductors Lead &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among industry groups in the Standard Poor's 500 Index,
            semiconductors are projected the post the strongest revenue growth for the second quarter, with 12 percent.
            That compares with 4.9 percent sales growth estimated for the broader information-technology group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While PC shipments declined in 2012 and 2013, some markets, such as the U.S., are seeing growth
            again as companies upgrade Intel-based PCs to get newer versions of Microsoft's Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Intel,
            the world's biggest chipmaker, raised its forecast for second-quarter sales last month on improving business
            demand for PCs, to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Analysts are projecting, on average, revenue
            of $13.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Santa Clara, California-based company may
            report revenue of more than $14 billion for the third quarter, projections show, surpassing that threshold
            for only the second time ever. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Jobs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is
            projected to post sales of $22 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in June, according to the
            average of analysts' estimates. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker in recent quarters has been
            benefiting from increasing sales in its newer Internet-based programs for the cloud. Since much of
            Microsoft's Windows and Office software is used on desktop computers, a recovery in those products could
            bolster results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A stabilizing PC market could, we believe, drive higher than expected
            Windows sales,' said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. who has the equivalent of a buy
            rating on Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of the focus will be on what Chief Executive Officer Satya
            Nadella reveals about the financial and staffing implications of his first mission memo, issued last week.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is planning its biggest round of job cuts in five years, in divisions such as
            engineering and marketing, as well as areas of overlap with Nokia Oyj's handset business, which it acquired
            this year. The restructuring -- which may be announced as soon as this week -- may end up being the biggest
            in Microsoft's history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, two of the people said. Some details are still
            being worked out, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella declined to comment about job cuts or
            any specific steps resulting from the note, saying he'd discuss implementation when Microsoft reports
            earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cuts could involve 5 percent to 10 percent of a workforce that swelled to
            about 127,000 employees with the addition of Nokia, according to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura
            Securities who has a buy rating on Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Apple Products &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apple,
            the world's largest technology company by market value, will also report on July 22. Apple's stock has
            gained 20 percent this year on investor optimism about a new batch of products on the horizon. Pent-up
            demand for bigger-screen iPhones will lead to record sales later this year, according to Michael Walkley, an
            analyst at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. who has a buy rating on Apple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts project
            Cupertino, California-based Apple will post an 8 percent rise in net income to $7.45 billion as sales climb
            to $37.8 billion, fueled by steady demand for the iPhone, which accounts for about half the company's
            revenue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rebound in PCs has coincided with a slowdown in sales of Apple's iPads as
            the market becomes increasingly saturated. Bigger smartphones are also partly responsible for the drop and
            sales of larger iPhones could cut further into tablet purchases, Walkley said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;IBM
            Challenges &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Microsoft, Intel and Apple are waiting to see if consumer demand will
            pick up in the second half of the year, technology companies that depend on corporate spending are
            contending with the growth of cloud computing. Customers are increasingly storing data and software on the
            Web, rather than on their own hardware, curbing the need for servers and mainframes from International
            Business Machines Corp. and other computer makers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IBM, reporting on July 17, is
            projected to post its ninth straight quarterly sales decline, according to the average of analysts'
            estimates, as it faces weaker demand for hardware and waning sales in developing countries like China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To meet profit targets, CEO Ginni Rometty is moving IBM's focus to cloud services and data
            analytics, while offloading less profitable businesses, such as its low-end server unit. Lenovo Group Ltd.
            has agreed to buy that division for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national security review. She's cut jobs
            and reduced the Armonk, New York-based company's tax rate to help boost earnings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Web
            Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The transition to mobile computing remains both an opportunity and a challenge
            for Web companies that depend on advertising to fuel sales. With ads command lower prices on mobile devices
            than they do on desktop computers, Google Inc. (GOOG) has is boosting the volume of ad sales. The Mountain
            View, California-based Web-search giant, which will report earnings on July 17, is projected to post
            second-quarter sales, excluding revenue passed to partners, of $12.3 billion, an 11 percent increase from a
            year earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, Google's average price per click on an ad slipped 9
            percent even as the number of hits on the promotions rose 26 percent. While Google's search engine is a
            common tool for surfing the Web on desktop computers, alternative applications are attracting users on
            smartphones and tablets. EMarketer Inc. predicts that Google's share of the U.S. mobile-search ad market
            will decline to 64 percent in 2016, from 83 percent in 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Ads &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. ad spending on tablets and smartphones, meanwhile, will rise 83 percent this year, according
            to EMarketer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Facebook is faring better in mobile ads, and is projected to make up 22
            percent of the market this year, up from 5.4 percent in 2012, according to EMarketer. Ad sales on tablets
            and smartphones now deliver a majority of Facebook's ad business, after contributing almost nothing a few
            years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Facebook has become one of the leaders in adapting to the most important
            Internet industry trend,' Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He has the
            equivalent of a buy rating on Menlo Park, California-based Facebook. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Yahoo, Alibaba
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)'s report today will provide an update on its turnaround under CEO
            Marissa Mayer, who has been at the helm for two years. She's seeking to expand content and ad deals
            following earlier efforts to attract users and better staff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After adjusted sales fell 1
            percent last year, Yahoo said revenue expanded by 1 percent in the first quarter, and analysts on average
            predict the Sunnyvale, California-based company will match that gain in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still,
            investors will keep their focus on Yahoo's stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the largest Chinese
            e-commerce company, which is set to hold an initial public offering. Yahoo is projected to bring in about
            $10 billion from the deal, and shareholders will look for any comments on how much of that, after taxes,
            will be distributed through buybacks or dividends. Yahoo also could use the money to make acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The outcome of the highly anticipated Alibaba IPO in August, the tax treatment of the proceeds and
            use of the new cash are likely to drive the stock short-term,' Youssef Squali, an analyst at Cantor
            Fitzgerald, wrote of Yahoo in a note on July 11. He has a buy rating on Yahoo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Says It Doesn't Give NSA Secret Encryption Keys</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), addressing
            persistent concerns that it has helped the U.S. government
            gather customer information, said it doesn't provide direct
            access to e-mails, instant messages or Skype calls and refuses
            to grant agencies the ability to break its encryption. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a letter today to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the
            company asked for permission to share more information on its
            communication with government agencies, saying it has a
            constitutional right to do so. Microsoft said such permission
            has been delayed and asked Holder for personal help. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and technology companies Apple Inc. (AAPL), Facebook
            Inc. (FB) and Yahoo! Inc. have come under scrutiny since a former
            U.S. National Security Agency contractor said publicly last
            month that the NSA is collecting user data. Microsoft said that
            while it's limited in what it can disclose about communications,
            the company doesn't grant access to servers and only provides
            governments with specific information about requests. That
            includes data from its SkyDrive cloud service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We do not provide any government with the ability to
            break the encryption, nor do we provide the government with the
            encryption keys,' Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said in
            a blog post today. 'When we are legally obligated to comply
            with demands, we pull the specified content from our servers
            where it sits in an unencrypted state, and then we provide it to
            the government agency.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brian Fallon, Holder's spokesman, didn't have an immediate
            comment on the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Guardian Report &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, the Guardian reported that Microsoft has helped
            the NSA get around the company's own encryption, citing
            documents obtained by the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, also said
            that when it receives a request for information held by a
            corporate customer, the company redirects the government to the
            client, unless prohibited from doing so. The Redmond,
            Washington-based company said it has never provided information
            on a corporate customer for national security purposes and
            complied with four requests in 2012 related to criminal law
            enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since the NSA documents were leaked, Microsoft has held
            talks with the Justice Department, Federal Bureau of
            Investigation and others in the intelligence community about
            which issues the company can publicly address, Smith wrote in
            the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 0.3 percent to $36.27 at the close in New
            York and has gained 36 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft, Green Mountain, Weather: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Even as they battle in court over
            smartphone and video technology, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG)
            have discovered a common foe: patent owners who try to sue their
            customers or go after an entire industry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Both companies are seeking to curb the litigation practices
            of firms that buy patents with the sole purpose of demanding
            royalties from as many end-users as they can, even if it means
            suing a pizza parlor or nonprofit. Anger has united a cross-section of retailers, finance companies,
            public-transit
            operators and hotels, and even caught the attention of President
            Barack Obama, who last month announced corrective measures. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Focusing on the issue could create pressure in Congress for
            legislation and action by U.S. courts -- as long as companies
            avoid the squabbling that marred the previous effort to change
            patent law. That took almost a decade and pitted industries, and
            even technology companies, against each other. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Going after bad litigation behavior is an approach we can
            all agree on,' said Tim Molino, director of government
            relations for Washington-based BSA - The Software Alliance,
            whose members include Microsoft and Oracle Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Matt Kallman referred questions about
            patent legislation to the Coalition for Patent Fairness, a
            Washington-based lobbying group backed by Google, Cisco Systems
            Inc. and Intel Corp. Each month, the group has a meeting with an
            increasing number of organizations to discuss ways to get
            legislative change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The increased political attention is due to patent owners
            who started going after product end-users, demanding cheap
            settlements from a large number of companies. A White House-commissioned report estimated that more than
            100,000 companies
            were threatened last year, including members of politically
            connected Washington trade groups like the National Retail
            Federation and Financial Services Roundtable. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Members of Congress have proposed legislation to limit some
            patent owners from seeking product import bans at the U.S.
            International Trade Commission, expand reviews of business
            method patents and force certain patent owners who lose at trial
            to pay legal fees of those they accused of infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The courts have also been trying to curb abuses. The ITC, a
            quasi-judicial agency in Washington, set up a program to resolve
            certain patent cases more quickly. The chief judge of the
            federal appeals court that specializes in patent law co-wrote a
            New York Times opinion piece advocating sanctions for litigation
            abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Getting a consensus could mean avoiding more controversial
            issues such as curbing software patents, and ensuring that any
            changes don't have unintended consequences that hurt
            universities needing legal protection for their research and
            patent-reliant businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Samsung Gets Patent on Mobile Phone That Docks With Tablet
            Device &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the Korean maker of smartphones
            and other electronic devices, received a patent for a mobile
            telephone that docks into a tablet device, according to the
            database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Patent D685774, issued July 9, is described as 'a terminal
            for wireless communication.' According to the patent drawings,
            the mobile phone appears to have a USB port and a jack for a
            headphone. The phone flares at the top and has rounded lower
            edges. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seocho-gu, South Korea-based Samsung applied for the patent
            in June 2012, with the assistance of NSIP Law of Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said in a statement yesterday that it was
            seeking the cause of an explosion of one of its mobile phones.
            Samsung said it was focused on quality control and customer
            safety. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Green Mountain Unit Seeks Trademark for Home Soda Machine &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)'s Keurig unit filed an
            application to register a trademark to be used with soda
            machines, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
            Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The application, filed July 3, is to register 'Karbon' as
            a trademark for 'machines for the production of cold water,
            soda, still, carbonated and sparkling beverages.' A second
            application filed that day is to register 'Bolt,' to be used
            for carafes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Keurig's soda machine would compete with those made by
            Israel's SodaStream International Ltd. (SODA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are not going to comment on this specific trademark,'
            Suzanne DuLong, a spokeswoman for Waterbury, Vermont-based Green
            Mountain, said in an e-mail. 'As we continue to grow, we are
            likely to seek any number of trademarks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flipboard Sued by Company Seeking to Use 'Flowboard' Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flipboard Inc., a maker of software for use on mobile
            devices, was sued over a trademark by a Seattle-based software
            company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed July 11 in federal court
            in Seattle, Treemo Inc. is seeking a court declaration that its
            'Flowboard' mark doesn't infringe Flipboard's trademarks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Treemo said it has been contacted by counsel for Flipboard
            threatening legal action over the trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In court papers, Treemo said that during the process of
            applying to register Flowboard as a trademark, the U.S. Patent
            and Trademark Office 'found no conflicting marks that would bar
            registration.' The company is also arguing that the two marks
            are used for different purposes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flowboard is used for a software product 'for the creation
            of side-scrolling presentations with images, text, video links
            and photo galleries,' according to the complaint. Flipboard is
            used with social networking services, something Treemo says it
            doesn't offer under its Flowboard mark. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Treemo argued that the patent office database
            contains almost 600 registrations or pending applications that
            contain some form of the word 'board.' The initial portions of
            the respective marks -- Flow and Flip --'connote substantially
            different images in the minds of ordinary consumers,' Treemo
            said in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Flipboard, based in Palo Alto, California, sent a statement
            to the TechCrunch website saying that it had wanted to resolve
            the dispute with Treemo amicably and that it's concerned about
            the likelihood of confusion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Treemo Inc., v. Flipboard Inc., 13-cv-01218,
            U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Goodreads Sued for Copyright Infringement Over Boy Band Photo &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodreads Inc., whose website lets readers share book
            recommendations, was sued for copyright infringement by a
            company that owns and licenses celebrity photos. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suit, filed July 5 in federal court in Los Angeles, is
            one of more than 20 brought since March 1 by BWP Media USA Inc.
            of Los Angeles. The company is represented in all these suits by
            Sanders Law Pllc of Garden City, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BWP said in its complaint that photos of a member of the
            boy band IM5 were posted on Goodreads without authorization and
            in willful violation of its copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Goodreads, based in Santa Monica, California, didn't
            respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment on the
            suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BWP asked the court money damages, attorney fees and
            litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is BWP Media USA Inc., v. Goodreads Inc., 2:13-cv-04851-E, U.S. District Court, Central
            District of California
            (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets Case Against Weather Channel to Proceed &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weather Channel LLC, the television network owned by Bain
            Capital LLC, Blackstone Group LP and NBC Universal International
            Ltd., failed to persuade a federal court to dismiss a trade-secrets case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Events Media Network Inc. of Shamong, New Jersey, sued
            Weather Channel in Pennsylvania state court in March 2012,
            claiming it violated a confidentiality agreement with respect to
            its events database. The database had been licensed to Weather
            Channel through May 1, 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Weather Channel used this confidential information both
            after the license expired and for purposes not covered by the
            agreement, Events Media said in its pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case was moved to federal court in Pennsylvania in May
            2012 before heading to a New Jersey federal court in November. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Weather Channel asked that the case be dismissed,
            saying that the database didn't qualify for trade-secrets
            protection because it contained information that was publicly
            available and that Events Media didn't take enough care to
            protect its secrecy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Robert B. Kugler in Camden, New Jersey,
            on July 12 rejected Weather Channel's arguments. He said the
            trade-secrets claims were made under Georgia law, which
            specifically covers compilations of what may be available to the
            public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge also concluded that Events Media took care to
            protect the confidentiality of the database and found that the
            license agreement with Weather Channel specifically limited the
            ways the information could be disclosed. The agreement also
            required reporting any inadvertent or improper use of the data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Events Media Network Inc. v. Weather Channel
            Interactive Inc., 13-cv-00003, U.S. District Court, District of
            New Jersey (Camden). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Taking Right-to-Be-Forgotten Requests for Bing</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. started taking
            requests from people in Europe who want its Bing search engine
            to hide results from searches on their names, more than two
            months after a court created a 'right to be forgotten.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online form went live in Europe today to comply
            with the European Union's Court of Justice ruling, Robin Koch, a
            spokesman for the company in Brussels, said by phone. The
            company will 'continue to work out the details of the process
            we'll use to evaluate the requests,' Koch said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google was ordered by the EU's top court in May to respond
            to people seeking details to be removed from its search engine.
            Google's online form went online at the end of May. The world's
            largest search provider got 70,000 take-down requests covering
            250,000 requests, its legal chief said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bing trails Google, which has a market share for search
            'well above 90 percent in most European countries,' the
            European Commission said last year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Xbox Sales Double in June With Lower Price Tag</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), chasing Sony Corp. (6758)
            for dominance in the U.S. video-game console market, said sales
            of its Xbox One doubled last month from May, after it added a
            lower-priced version of the machine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Over the past month, we've seen a strong spike in
            interest in our Xbox One console options, including the new $399
            offering,' the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a blog
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft introduced a cheaper machine on June 9 after
            struggling to convince gamers that the $499 price tag of the
            console is justified. Since both the Xbox One and the
            PlayStation 4 were introduced in November, marking a new
            generation of gaming consoles, Microsoft's machine has trailed
            Sony's in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Microsoft used an entire presentation at
            the E3 conference in Los Angeles to focus on hard-core players,
            who were alienated by the Xbox One's debut that focused on non-game entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two companies are now gearing up for the year-end
            holiday season. Starting in August with the release of Madden
            NFL 15, new blockbuster titles will start being released for the
            Xbox One, Microsoft said today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Apple, AT&amp;amp;T, Microsoft Stink Less: Rich Jaroslovsky</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;It's hard for a company that's
            improved a pilloried product to announce to the world, 'Hey, we
            stink less than we used to.' So, Apple (AAPL), ATT (T) and Microsoft, I'm
            here to do it for you. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With relatively little fanfare, the three tech giants have
            significantly improved offerings that, in their earlier forms,
            earned scathing criticism and damaged reputations: ATT's voice
            service, Apple Maps and Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The best thing that ever happened to ATT Mobility was also
            the worst: the four years it held exclusive U.S. rights to
            Apple's iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From a business standpoint, it was undoubtedly a winner,
            bringing millions of customers. From a user standpoint, it was a
            disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ATT's network was overwhelmed by the bandwidth-munching
            hordes of iPhone users, giving it a well-deserved reputation for
            uncompleted and dropped calls and making it the butt of late-night TV humor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ATT 'literally got crushed by the iPhone, and public
            perception was even worse,' says Bill Moore, president and
            chief executive officer of RootMetrics, a Bellevue, Washington-based firm that uses crowd-sourced data to
            help measure wireless
            carriers' performance. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Carrier Choice &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, ATT has poured tens of
            billions of dollars into improving its network. Meanwhile, the
            2011 end of its exclusive deal gave iPhone users a choice of
            carriers. Verizon Wireless, Sprint (S) and most recently T-Mobile US
            now offer the iPhone to their customers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft to End TV Production One Month After Show Debut</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), which announced its
            biggest job cuts ever today, will shutter an ambitious effort to
            create original television programs just one month after the
            first show rolled out. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Xbox Entertainment Studio will close in coming months,
            Xbox chief Phil Spencer said in an e-mail to employees. Nancy Tellem, the ex-CBS executive brought in to
            lead the effort two

            Tellem assembled a team in a Santa Monica, California, and put
            together six confirmed series, along with more than a dozen in
            development as of April. The first, a street-football reality TV
            show, came out last month during the World Cup. &lt;/p&gt;

            head of Xbox, remained
            committed to the TV effort. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With Microsoft and new CEO Satya Nadella cutting 18,000
            positions and trying to focus more closely on selling software
            for mobile and the cloud, TV is being jettisoned. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it will eliminate as many as 18,000 jobs, the largest round of cuts in
            its history, as Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella integrates Nokia Oyj's handset unit and slims down the
            software maker. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The restructuring, amounting to about 14 percent of its workforce,
            includes 12,500 Nokia factory and professional positions -- half the number of employees added in the
            acquisition. At Microsoft, cuts will be in sales, marketing and engineering. The reductions are expected to
            be completed by June 30, 2015, and will result in a pretax charge of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion, Microsoft
            said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella, who took over from Steve Ballmer in February, is
            retooling the company's structure as it seeks to compete with nimbler rivals offering mobile and
            Internet-based software and services. He's also working to wring a promised $600 million in annual savings
            from Microsoft's Nokia deal, which added 25,000 workers in April, bringing the total to about 127,100. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nasdaq 100 Futures Slide on Google, Microsoft Results</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nasdaq 100 Index futures dropped
            after Google Inc.'s second-quarter results fell short of
            estimates and Microsoft Inc.'s profit missed projections, adding
            to disappointing results from big technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid 1 percent to 3,047.50 at
            5:11 p.m. in New York. The index slipped 0.2 percent today even
            as the Standard Poor's 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial
            Average rose to records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There are some chinks in the armor out there,' Daniel Genter, who oversees about $4 billion as
            president and chief
            executive officer of Los Angeles-based RNC Genter Capital
            Management, said in a telephone interview. 'Though is it priced
            for perfection, it isn't perfection. Investors are becoming more
            discerning with regards to individual stocks.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google slid 3.8 percent to $876. The owner of the world's
            most popular search engine reported second-quarter sales and
            profit that fell short of analysts' estimates as advertising
            tied to mobile devices crimped average prices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft plunged 6.1 percent to $33.28 as profit missed
            analysts' projections after Windows sales were hurt by shrinking
            demand for personal computers amid an unexpected writedown of
            unsold Surface tablet inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The results from Google and Microsoft came after technology
            stocks fell 0.3 percent during regular trading, the second-worst
            performance among 10 groups in the SP 500 today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. fell the most in the Dow today after
            forecasting sales that may fall short of some analysts'
            estimates. EBay Inc. tumbled 6.7 percent, the most since August
            2011, after its third-quarter sales forecast missed estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SP 500 gained 0.5 percent to 1,689.37 at 4 p.m. in New
            York, as earnings from Morgan Stanley and UnitedHealth Group
            Inc. beat estimates and jobless claims fell. The index surpassed
            its previous intraday high of 1,687.18 set on May 22. The Dow
            Jones Industrial Average added 78.02 points, or 0.5 percent, to
            15,548.54, also a record. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SP 500 futures were up 0.3 percent at 5:15 p.m. in New
            York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Job Cuts Can't Cool Seattle's Hunger for Code Writers</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The largest job cuts in Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s history are a recruiting opportunity for
            Seattle-area rivals, who see them as a chance to snatch talent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a measure of the
            Redmond, Washington-based company's lessening dominance of a regional software industry it all but created,
            technology executives say the cuts may only dent a frenzied job market driven by companies from Amazon.com
            Inc. to Zillow Inc. (Z) Some entice workers with perks such as free lunches, paid dry cleaning and, at one
            startup, a half-share of a sustainably raised hog for scouting a new software engineer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We
            all have effectively an infinite number of open positions for software developers, program managers,' said
            Spencer Rascoff, chief executive officer of Zillow. 'If I somehow magically filled 100 positions we'd open
            another 100, and Amazon would too.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which is cutting as many as 18,000 jobs
            worldwide, says the initial round will affect 1,351 in the Puget Sound region surrounding Seattle. While
            those who lost administrative work may not be as fortunate, software engineers can pick from more than 6,000
            open positions in the Seattle area, according to the job listings site Indeed.com. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Founded
            by Seattle natives Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, Microsoft put its operating system on most of the
            world's desktop computers and helped the region diversify its national identify from airplanes, logging and
            fish. The software maker is the state's second-biggest private employer after Boeing Co. (BA), with 43,031
            Puget Sound jobs as of June. &lt;/p&gt;

            retooling the company's structure as it seeks to compete with
            nimbler rivals offering mobile and Internet-based software and
            services. He's also working to wring a promised $600 million in
            annual savings from Microsoft's Nokia deal, which added 25,000
            workers in April, bringing the total to about 127,100. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft needs to be a leaner tech giant over the coming
            years in order to strike the right balance of growth and
            profitability around its cloud and mobile endeavors,' said

            Microsoft stock the equivalent of a buy. The cuts are roughly
            twice as big as Wall Street expected, Ives said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 1 percent to $44.53 at yesterday's close in
            New York. They have advanced 19 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Streamline Management &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company started with 13,000 cuts yesterday, and the
            majority of eliminated workers will be notified in the next six
            months, Nadella said in an e-mail to employees. Microsoft will
            also have fewer layers of management and will make changes to
            its outside vendor staff, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The first step to building the right organization for our
            ambitions is to realign our workforce,' he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last week, in his first mission statement, Nadella said the
            Redmond, Washington-based software maker needs to become more
            focused and efficient and requires changes to its engineering
            teams. He pledged updates on the new plans later this month, and
            said he would provide more details when the company reports
            earnings on July 22. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft investors are likely to view the cuts as a
            positive sign, illustrating that Nadella is trying to get costs
            and headcount under control and that he understands the
            challenges facing Microsoft, Ives said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Earnings Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We view this as another step in the right direction from
            the Street's perspective,' he said in an interview. 'Nadella
            is not wearing rose-colored glasses.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The reductions may add 30 cents a share to Microsoft's
            profit in fiscal 2016, estimated Kirk Materne, an analyst at
            Evercore Partners Inc., who rates Microsoft the equivalent of a
            buy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company has needed to cut costs. Analysts on average
            estimate that profit before certain items increased 1 percent in
            the fiscal year that ended last month, after a decline in fiscal
            2013 and little growth the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Given the stock's gains in recent months on optimism about
            Nadella's plans, it's time for the company to post earnings
            growth that validates that enthusiasm, said Brent Thill, an
            analyst at UBS AG, who recommends buying the stock. Microsoft
            spends far more on product development and research than rivals
            such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) and gets a smaller return for
            that investment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They have been spending on a lot of things that haven't
            come to fruition,' he said. 'The Nadella era will be about
            putting more money on bigger hits and not sprinkling a little
            everywhere.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Focus &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In appearances at company and technology events since he
            took the helm, Nadella has reiterated that the company's
            priorities are mobile and cloud products, as he works to shift
            Microsoft away from its longtime core business of software for
            personal computers. Nadella has signaled a desire to produce
            software for rival operating systems, like Apple's iOS and
            Google's Android, and has shuffled management in areas like
            marketing, business development and the Xbox game console. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has implemented smaller, intermittent job
            cuts in individual businesses -- for example, trimming a few
            hundred positions in advertising sales and marketing in 2012,
            and some marketing jobs across the company earlier that same
            year -- the 39-year-old company has only undertaken a
            companywide restructuring affecting thousands of workers once
            before, in 2009, at the start of the recession. Over the course
            of that year, the company cut 5,800 jobs, or about 5 percent of
            its workforce at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cost Savings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When Microsoft agreed to acquire Nokia's device unit in
            September, the software maker pledged $600 million in yearly
            cost savings in the 18 months after the deal closed. While this
            week's layoffs are the company's biggest ever, excluding the
            12,500 positions being eliminated at Nokia, the 5,500 job cuts
            at Microsoft are smaller than those in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's engineering teams have traditionally been split
            between program managers, developers and testers. Now, with new
            cloud-based methods of building software, it often makes sense
            to have the developers test and fix bugs instead of a separate
            team of testers, Nadella said in an interview last week after
            releasing his memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nokia Shift &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Nokia business, now part of Microsoft's devices group,
            will also undergo some product changes as Microsoft ends output
            of phones running Google's Android operating system and targets
            the 'more affordable smartphone segments,' wrote devices group
            chief Stephen Elop, formerly the CEO of Nokia, in an e-mail
            posted on Microsoft's site. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will switch the Nokia X, which uses Android, to
            the Windows Phone operating system to broaden its products in
            the cheaper smartphone category. It will also align future high-end smartphone releases with major products
            from Windows and
            Microsoft's applications team, Elop said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company will also combine what had been two units at
            Nokia -- Smart Devices and Mobile Phones -- into one under
            executive Jo Harlow. Phone engineering will be based in Salo,
            Finland, for high-end devices, and Tampere, Finland, for cheaper
            ones. Engineering work in Oulu, Finland, will be scaled down. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Engineering in Beijing and San Diego will see cuts, and
            phone production will be focused mainly in Hanoi. Nokia will
            shift repair and manufacturing operations from Hungary. The cuts
            may affect 1,100 employees in Finland and about 1,800 in
            Hungary, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elop's memo was derided by publications from New York
            magazine to the Guardian, which titled a blog 'How not to cut
            12,500 jobs,' for starting with the greeting 'Hello There,'
            and failing to get to the job cuts until the 11th paragraph of
            14. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;TV Programming &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the Xbox business, the company will shut down an
            ambitious effort to create original television programming, just
            one month after the debut of its first show. The Xbox
            Entertainment Studio will close in coming months, Xbox chief
            Phil Spencer said in an e-mail to employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nancy Tellem, the ex-CBS executive brought in to lead the
            effort two years ago, will stay on with some of her team to
            complete shows in production, such as a 'Halo' series, the
            company said. Tellem was hired by former CEO Ballmer to draw
            more entertainment consumers to Xbox by getting into original
            programming, like Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As the technology industry increasingly shifts toward
            mobile computing and cloud-based services, other technology
            companies have also sought to keep up by streamlining and firing

        <headline>Microsoft's Quarterly Profit Hurt by Nokia Acquisition</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reported profit that fell short of estimates in the fiscal fourth quarter,
            weighed down by the acquisition of Nokia Oyj's handset unit, where about 12,500 jobs will be cut. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Net income in the period that ended June 30 was $4.61 billion, or 55 cents a share, including
            adjustments related to Nokia, the company said in a statement today. Analysts were predicting, on average,
            profit of 60 cents a share, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding the Nokia-related items
            and taxes, profit would have been 66 cents a share, beating the average prediction for 64 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who took over in February, is struggling to cut costs at
            Nokia after Microsoft completed its 5.44 billion euro ($7.33 billion) acquisition of the mobile-phone
            operations in April. Microsoft's main software business topped estimates, owing to strength in
            Internet-based cloud programs and corporate computer applications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Microsoft
            CEO, Seeking Growth, Tells Managers: Step It Up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Nokia continues to be the black cloud
            over Microsoft,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets Co. who has the equivalent of a buy
            rating on the stock. 'This is the first quarter before the cost cuts. That's why Nadella took the ax out.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft rose 1.3 percent in extended trading
            following the report. They were little changed at $44.83 at the close in New York. The stock climbed 1.7
            percent last quarter, compared with a 4.7 percent increase in the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nokia
            Challenge &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Nokia numbers underscore the challenges facing Nadella and his
            lieutenants as they seek to halt the decline of the handset business and turn it into an asset that can aid
            Microsoft's mobile efforts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Satya has taken a number of exciting steps both to
            reposition the company and to energize it,' Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella will cut more costs and prioritize core areas, he said on a conference call
            today. He also pledged to make the money-losing Bing search engine profitable by fiscal 2016. Nadella said
            MSN websites, retail stores and hardware production are now considered supporting efforts, where costs will
            be watched carefully. Hood said Microsoft's new phone unit, formerly the Nokia handset business, is on track
            to break even on an operating basis in 2016 as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to cut operating
            costs for the current fiscal year to $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion, Hood said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cloud,
            Enterprise &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, cloud and enterprise software performed well, with revenue
            doubling for the Web-based versions of Office and Microsoft's Azure cloud-based service for hosting
            applications. Commercial cloud products now have an annual run-rate of $4.4 billion, Hood said. Corporate
            demand for personal computers helped shore up sales of Office and Windows to businesses, with companies
            signing multiyear licensing deals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Cloud looked strong -- core PC seemed to get an
            uplift from improving PC demand,' Ives said. 'Office 365 and Azure continue to be pillars of strength. I
            would call this in-line results.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unearned revenue, which comes from sales of multiyear
            deals that will be recognized in the future, was $25.2 billion for the quarter, compared with the $24.5
            billion average analyst projection, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Restructuring
            Efforts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to a plan to cut a total of 18,000 jobs as the company integrates
            Nokia, Nadella has discontinued unpromising products and placed more emphasis on cloud-computing software
            delivered via the Web. The restructuring will result in $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in charges in the
            current fiscal year, according to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The company as a whole is galvanized
            around Satya's strategy,' Hood said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also seeing signs of improvement in
            the PC market, which drives sales of Windows and Office software. PC shipments declined 1.7 percent in the
            second quarter, a smaller drop than estimated as businesses upgraded their equipment. Demand in the U.S.,
            Europe and Canada also helped to make up for a drop in Asia, researcher IDC said earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Intel Corp. also released results last week that topped analysts' projections. Microsoft's Hood
            said the company is seeing similar trends to those reported by Intel. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The strength in
            the enterprise and the comments on the refresh would seem to bode well for Microsoft continuing to have
            uptake with enterprise sales,' said Michael Shinnick, a fund manager at South Bend, Indiana-based Wasatch
            Advisors Inc., which has $19 billion under management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft CEO, Seeking Growth, Tells Managers: Step It Up</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The day Satya Nadella became Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s chief executive officer, he invited several
            dozen vice presidents to breakfast and had a simple, calm admonition for them: 'Can you step it up?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The engineer's tone was a departure from the yelling and wild gesticulations favored by his
            salesman predecessor Steve Ballmer and the razor-sharp interrogations of co-founder Bill Gates. Nadella's
            approach underlines the low-key and analytical style he brings as CEO since starting the job in February, as
            he seeks to revamp the world's largest software maker. Nadella has unveiled plans to cut more than 18,000
            jobs, killed unpromising products and boosted sales of computing tools delivered via the Internet, while
            seeking to reduce the company's reliance on software installed on personal computers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He's
            one of those people where you just hate to say no to the guy,' Jeff Teper, Microsoft's head of corporate
            strategy, said of Nadella in an interview in March. Teper hired Nadella into the company in 1992. 'Steve and
            Bill are a lot more confrontational -- they challenge you to bring your A game. With him it's more like
            'well I don't want to disappoint the guy, let me work a little bit harder here.' He's incredibly smart, he's
            gracious, but he's also super-demanding.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s purchase of Nokia Oyj's mobile business dragged down fiscal fourth-quarter
            profit, even as the software maker benefits from improving corporate demand for computers and software
            delivered over the Web. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia's operations, which Microsoft bought for 5.44 billion
            euros ($7.33 billion) in April, contributed to a 7.1 percent decline in net income to $4.61 billion, or 55
            cents a share, for the period that ended June 30, the company said in a statement yesterday. That missed
            analysts' average projection for profit of 60 cents a share, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

        <headline>Microsoft China Target of Potential Probe, Sina Reports</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Chinese regulators met with managers
            at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s offices in four cities including Beijing
            and Shanghai in preparation for a potential probe into whether
            the company engaged in monopolistic practices, Sina.com said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;State Administration for Industry and Commerce officials
            also called on Microsoft in Guangzhou and Chengdu yesterday, the
            news portal said on its website, citing a Microsoft China
            employee it didn't identify. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Regulators may start a probe into Microsoft's possible
            monopoly in China's operating system market, Sina.com added,
            citing another unidentified person. China is stepping up
            scrutiny of U.S. technology companies, and excluded Windows 8
            from a government purchasing order in May. U.S. tensions with
            China escalated after prosecutors indicted five Chinese military
            officers for allegedly stealing secrets of American companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft is happy to answer the government's
            questions,' the company said in an e-mailed statement
            yesterday, without confirming whether authorities had visited
            its local offices in China. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 1.2
            percent to $43.97 at the close in New York, leaving them up 18
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China said in May it will vet technology companies for
            potential national security breaches, after the government
            threatened retaliation for a U.S. indictment of Chinese military
            officers on cyberspying claims. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft First Out of the Xbox After China's Ban Falls</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;It's game on in China, as Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) Xbox One becomes the first entertainment console
            to hit the market after the end of a 13-year ban. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft today began taking orders
            for its new game console from online retailer JD.com Inc. (JD) via Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s (700)
            mobile-messaging applications. The pair of Chinese Internet companies hold exclusive rights to pre-sell the
            locally made Xbox One until July 30, JD.com said in a news release. The console is slated to ship nationwide
            in September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft was the industry's first big player to start production in the
            country after the Chinese government last year allowed console sales in the new Shanghai free-trade zone and
            opened up an estimated $10 billion market. The first Xbox didn't even exist in 2000, when the Communist
            Party banned game systems over concern they would be bad for kids. It was released a year later. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The potential market for Xbox in China is huge, there's a lot of prospects for growth,' said Bill
            Fan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Securities Co. 'Tencent could cooperate with Microsoft on games in
            the future, and Xbox can utilize Tencent and JD.com's distribution channels to generate more sales.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tencent shares rose 3.2 percent to close at HK$128.90 in Hong Kong. Microsoft has gained about 19
            percent this year, compared with a 7 percent rise for the SP 500 Index. Microsoft shares rose 0.2 percent to
            $44.50 in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Entry Points &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox One pre-orders
            on JD.com require a deposit of 499 yuan (US$81), and will only be available to those who use the Chinese
            versions of Tencent's WeChat and QQ mobile-messaging apps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner
            wouldn't disclose the number of Xbox Ones the company was selling nor the price. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Launching
            Xbox One sales in China through JD.com's Weixin and Mobile QQ entry points underscores the strength of these
            platforms with young and sophisticated Chinese consumers,' Du Shuang, vice president of JD.com, said in the
            news release, using the Chinese name for Tencent's WeChat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;JD.com will begin directly
            accepting pre-orders for the new Xbox through its website and its exhibition booth at the ChinaJoy Expo in
            Shanghai on July 31, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trade Zone &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Game consoles
            were included on the list of items to be liberalized before Shanghai's free-trade zone before its creation
            last September. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around the same time, Microsoft formed a $79 million joint venture with
            BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a unit of Shanghai Media Group Inc., to begin making Xbox consoles in the
            free-trade zone for the Chinese market. BesTV invested $40.3 million for a 51 percent stake in the
            enterprise, while Microsoft put in $38.7 million, according a September filing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            State Council, China's cabinet, has since temporarily lifted the ban nationwide and announced plans to draft
            new rules on their sale. The country's video-game industry will generate about $10 billion in sales next
            year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758) has similarly agreed to
            form two ventures with the Shanghai Oriental Pearl (Group) Co., to start making PlayStation consoles in
            China. Nintendo Co. plans to expand in emerging markets with new devices starting next year, the company's
            president, Satoru Iwata, said on May 8. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been chasing Sony for dominance in
            the U.S. video-game console market. It introduced a lower-priced version of its Xbox One costing $399 on
            June 9 to narrow a $100 price difference with the PS4. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Duncan Clark, the Beijing-based
            chairman of BDA China Ltd., which advises technology companies, said Tencent and JD.com were well-positioned
            to benefit from the lifting of the ban. 'For Xbox, Tencent is the most established games distributor, and,
            for JD, it's logistics, shipping and quality control,' Clark said. 'So it makes a lot of sense.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;China regulators opened an anti-monopoly investigation into Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seizing
            computers and documents from offices in four cities amid escalating tensions with U.S. technology companies.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government also is investigating Microsoft executives in China, including a vice
            president, according to a statement posted today on the State Administration for Industry Commerce website.
            The regulator urged the company to cooperate after almost 100 SAIC staff inspected the offices yesterday,
            copying contracts and financial statements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China stepped up the pressure on U.S.
            companies after American prosecutors indicted five Chinese military officers in May for allegedly stealing
            corporate secrets. Microsoft, Google Inc. and Apple Inc. (AAPL) have since been criticized by state media
            for allegedly cooperating with a U.S. spying program, and Qualcomm (QCOM) Inc. in November disclosed an
            investigation related to anti-monopoly law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They're playing a long game,' said Duncan
            Clark, the Beijing-based chairman of BDA China Ltd., which advises technology companies. China wants to
            discourage U.S. security agencies from using American technology companies, while also promoting domestic
            competitors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Earnings in the period that ended in June were hit by a

            and documents from offices in four cities amid escalating
            tensions with U.S. technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government also is investigating Microsoft executives
            in China, including a vice president, according to a statement
            posted yesterday on the State Administration for Industry
            Commerce website. The regulator urged the company to cooperate
            after almost 100 members of its staff inspected the offices July
            28, copying contracts and financial statements. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China stepped up the pressure on U.S. companies after
            American prosecutors indicted five Chinese military officers in
            May, accusing them of stealing corporate secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged the probe July 28 in an e-mail and
            said it's 'happy to answer' government questions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. and China have traded accusations over cyberspying
            on information-technology security for years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Barclays Swiss Unit Quits U.S. Justice Department Tax Program &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc (BARC)'s Swiss unit is withdrawing from the U.S.
            Justice Department's taxpayer disclosure program, a bank
            official said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The official asked not to be identified as the information
            hasn't been publicly announced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Barclays said in its 2013 annual report that it would take
            part in the program, which required a review of U.S. client
            accounts in Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. previously said 106 Swiss banks applied to join
            the program to seek non-prosecution agreements for managing
            undeclared money for Americans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Markets Agency's Tougher Stand Sends Settlement Rate to 97% &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Almost all the fines levied by the U.K. Financial Conduct
            Authority since 2010 have come through settlements as the
            regulator's tougher stance pushes more firms to yield quickly,
            according to law firm data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Of the 944 million pounds ($1.6 billion) in fines reaped by
            the FCA from January 2010 to December 2013, 915 million pounds,
            or 97 percent, came from settlements, London-based Freshfields
            Bruckhaus Deringer LLP said, citing public records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Firms and individuals who settle early can get a discount
            of as much as 30 percent. Or they can challenge the fine before
            the Regulatory Decisions Committee, an FCA forum that plays a
            role in approving and reviewing fines. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lara Joseph, a spokeswoman for the FCA, declined to comment
            on Freshfields' findings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.K. Treasury opened a consultation on the FCA's
            enforcement decision-making processes in May. The review, due in
            the autumn, will examine the role of the decisions committee in
            particular. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;DreamWorks Animation Slides After Loss as SEC Probes Writedown &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA), the independent cartoon-movie studio, posted a second-quarter
            loss and said securities
            regulators are investigating a writedown. The shares fell 7.5
            percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Executives said on a conference call yesterday that the
            U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into how the
            company wrote down its 'Turbo' inventory, without being more
            specific. They said DreamWorks Animation learned of the
            investigation in the second quarter and is cooperating. They
            declined to elaborate further. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, led by co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, has
            struggled to recoup its costs on recent films such as 'Turbo,'
            a 2013 movie that led to a writedown. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The studio's current theatrical film, 'How to Train Your
            Dragon 2,' has generated $424.6 million in worldwide box office
            sales, according to Box Office Mojo, a sum that's shared with
            theaters and the company's distributor, 21st Century Fox Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It will be a highly profitable film for the company,'
            Katzenberg said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interviews/Commentary &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deutsche Bank Reporting System to Be Ready on Time, CFO Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are confident that the program we have in place will
            fully address our regulatory reporting requirements within the
            necessary time frame,' Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) Chief Financial Officer
            Stefan Krause said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He made the comments on an investor call with Bloomberg
            News, responding to media reports on the bank's U.S. regulatory
            reporting system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The architecture of the bank's U.S. compliance system is
            'complex and will take time to complete,' Krause said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sanctions May Pose Risk to BP's Rosneft Dividend, Rainforth Says &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lydia Rainforth, an analyst at Barclays Plc, talked about
            the outlook for OAO Rosneft (ROSN)'s contribution to BP Plc (BP/)'s earnings
            and the possible impact of Russian sanctions on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She spoke from London with Guy Johnson on Bloomberg

        <headline>Microsoft Fails to Block U.S. Warrant for Ireland E-Mail</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost its challenge
            to a U.S. government search warrant ordering the software giant
            to produce e-mails of an unidentified customer stored in a data
            center in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan today
            upheld a federal magistrate's decision requiring the company to
            turn over e-mails in a drug investigation. Preska delayed the
            effect of her ruling to give Microsoft time to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Preska rejected Microsoft's argument that the warrant,
            which requires the company to provide investigators with the
            contents of the customer's MSN.com Web-based e-mail, calls for
            an illegal search and seizure outside the U.S. The nation in
            which the customer lives wasn't disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge delivered her ruling from the bench after a two-hour hearing, endorsing an April decision
            by U.S. Magistrate
            Judge James C. Francis IV. Today's ruling sets up an appeal that
            may help dictate how courts apply legal protections to
            electronic data, particularly information stored by Internet
            service providers outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Congress intended in this statute for ISPs to produce
            information under their control, albeit stored abroad, to law
            enforcement in the United States,' Preska said. 'As Judge
            Francis found, it is a question of control, not a question of
            the location of that information.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stored Communications &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During the hearing, lawyers for both sides argued over the
            reach of the Stored Communications Act, or SCA, part of the
            Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The SCA allows
            law enforcement agents to obtain information through subpoenas,
            court orders or warrants, depending on the records sought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The only issue that was certain this morning was that the
            district court's decision would not represent the final step in
            this process,' Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said in
            a statement after the hearing. 'We will appeal promptly and
            continue to advocate that people's e-mail deserves strong
            privacy protection in the U.S. and around the world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft argued that the
            government should be required to get the e-mails through
            procedures dictated by a law-enforcement treaty between the U.S.
            and Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner told Preska that the
            treaty process, which can be complicated and time-consuming,
            isn't legally required. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Right Here' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We don't need to go to a foreign country to get the
            records,' Turner said. 'The provider is right here.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;E. Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Microsoft, argued that
            the government is seeking to 'conscript Microsoft here in the
            United States to search files abroad.' He said that if other
            countries required Microsoft to provide them with e-mails of
            customers located in the U.S. 'we would consider that an
            astounding infringement of our sovereignty.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That is a very, very dangerous principle that the
            government is articulating,' Rosenkranz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rosenkranz told Preska that officials in China this week
            demanded a password to seek e-mail information in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Mr. Turner, what do you say to that?' Preska asked.
            'It's pretty scary.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Turner said concerns about what other countries may do
            should be addressed 'through political and diplomatic
            channels,' not by ignoring the terms of the SCA. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Company Support &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Preska also heard arguments from lawyers representing ATT
            Inc. (T), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco Systems
            Inc. (CSCO), which supported Microsoft's position. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Today's decision is a major blow not just for Microsoft,
            but for the entire U.S. cloud-computing industry,' Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the
            American Civil
            Liberties Union, said in a statement today. 'If these companies
            wish to regain the trust of their global customers, they must
            embrace security technologies such as cloud cryptography, which
            can provide real privacy protections where the law does not.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of a Warrant to Search a Certain
            E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 13-mj-02814, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Said to Cut Windows for Tablet Prices</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is cutting the price of its Windows software for small tablets, seeking to
            shore up foundering efforts to combat Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the mobile-computing market, people with
            knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using the changes to try and get more
            manufacturers to adopt Windows RT, a version of its flagship software for tablets, said the people, who
            asked not to be identified because pricing is confidential. The price cuts affect Windows RT for small-sized
            tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A year after unveiling the first Windows RT machines aimed at eroding Apple and
            Google Inc. (GOOG)'s lead in the $64 billion tablet market, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
            struggling. Global device makers such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and HTC Corp. (2498) are shunning the
            system, leaving a dearth of RT machines in stores and giving Windows RT less than a percentage point of
            market share in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent for Apple, according to IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You
            need more breadth of equipment manufacturers making the devices, you need lower prices, you need a better
            selection of devices,' said Wes Miller, an analyst at Kirkland, Washington-based Directions on Microsoft.
            That's calling into question 'the long-term viability' of Microsoft's Windows RT strategy, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>GoPro Names Ex-Microsoft Executive Tony Bates as President</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;GoPro Inc., the maker of cameras used
            by surfers, skiers and sky divers to record their adventures,
            recruited former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executive Tony Bates as
            president and added him to the board. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bates, 47, will join as second-in-command at the San Mateo,
            California-based video maker, reporting to GoPro founder and
            Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Woodman, the company said in a
            statement today. Bates left Microsoft in March after he was
            passed over for the CEO job that went to colleague Satya Nadella. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GoPro, which filed preliminary documents for a U.S. initial
            public offering in February and a public prospectus last month,
            plans to position itself as a media company distributing video
            content. Most of its $985.7 million revenue last year was
            derived through cameras and accessories. Bates, a former Cisco
            Systems Inc. executive, ran Microsoft's Skype unit before
            becoming an executive vice president in July, where he ran
            business development and evangelism. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The video and equipment maker also said today that it added
            Dolby Laboratories Inc. Chairman Peter Gotcher to its board,
            bringing the total number of directors to seven. Gotcher co-founded Digidesign Inc., maker of digital-audio

        <headline>Microsoft to Add Outlook to Windows RT After Complaints</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), facing lackluster
            sales of tablets running its software, said it will include the
            popular Outlook e-mail program in a new version of Windows RT,
            after a previous application met with customer complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Outlook 2013 RT will be part of the free Windows 8.1 update
            that will be publicly tested starting June 26 and officially
            released later this year, the company said in a blog posting.
            Users of Windows RT -- Microsoft's software for devices running
            chips with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology -- said the previous e-mail program was more basic and lacked
            many Outlook features. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose executives are speaking today at the
            Computex computer show in Taipei, are trying to jump-start sales
            of Windows RT-based tablets after just 200,000 units were
            shipped in the first quarter, according to IDC. In an effort to
            woo device makers that have avoided using the operating system,
            the company is rolling out price cuts for partners who opt to
            use RT in smaller tablets, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're always listening to our customers,' the company
            said in the blog. 'One piece of feedback was that people want
            the power of Outlook on all their Windows PCs and tablets.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Windows Chief Financial Officer Tami Reller will unveil the
            addition of Outlook as part of a speech at the conference, and
            Antoine Leblond, a Windows vice president, will give the first
            public demonstration of Windows 8.1. The company announced some
            features of the updated software last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ARM Tablets &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Windows RT is a version of Windows 8 for machines running
            chips based on ARM designs. Of five such devices that have gone
            on sale since the program was released in October, only
            Microsoft's own Surface tablet remains widely available, Reller
            said last month. Computer makers such as Acer Inc. (2353) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) have steered clear
            of the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Windows RT already comes with several Office programs,
            including Word and Excel for spreadsheets. Instead of including
            Outlook, which also lets users manage contacts and calendars,
            the company built a new mail app for this version of Windows,
            prompting complaints from customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At least one Microsoft partner also asked the company to
            reconsider. Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang
            has said he wants Microsoft to include a version of Outlook that
            works on RT. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Give me Outlook and I'll use it every day,' Huang, whose
            company makes chips used in Microsoft's Surface RT and other
            devices based on the software, said in May. The executive said
            in March that he was disappointed with sales of RT-based
            tablets. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seeking to position its Xbox One entertainment console as the premium
            living-room choice for gamers as well as families, showed exclusive titles such as 'Halo' and set a price
            that surprised analysts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox One will hit stores in November for $499 in the U.S.,
            Microsoft executives said today at the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. The console will
            have 13 exclusive next-generation games, said Don Mattrick, president of the company's interactive
            entertainment unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using E3 to blunt the perception that the console
            de-emphasizes games in favor of movies, sports and functions like Skype video-calling. The company today
            showed major titles like Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)'s 'Battlefield 4' with some exclusive content, and
            highlighted features that make games more interactive, social and hyper-realistic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'As
            we've been promising, it's all about the games,' Mattrick said from the stage at E3. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            machine, first announced on May 21, uses improved Kinect voice commands and motion sensing to recognize
            users and switch between games, TV shows and Skype calls. The emphasis on other content led to grumbling
            among serious gamers, concerns Microsoft set out to answer today showing the new Xbox's advanced features
            can lift traditional game play as well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next version of 'Halo,' Microsoft's
            top-selling science-fiction game that has anchored the Xbox, will arrive in 2014, the company said. It will
            run at 60 frames per second, more than double the speed of most movies today. 'Plants vs. Zombies,' another
            Electronic Arts game, will be exclusive to Xbox. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Price Tag &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exclusive
            Xbox One titles with advanced graphics also include 'Sunset Overdrive,' from Insomniac Games Inc., and
            Crytek's 'Ryse: Son of Rome.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Analysts said they were surprised at the $499 price tag
            for the console, an upfront cost that could potentially be lowered by contracts for content such as for
            Microsoft's Xbox Live service. The machine will cost 499 euros ($662) in most of Europe and 429 pounds
            ($668) in the U.K., Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It seems expensive,' said Brian Blau, an analyst
            with researcher Gartner Inc. 'It really seems like they are trying to create a different type of premium
            product, like Apple creates a premium product with high-end design, and comes in at a high price. It
            certainly seems Microsoft is putting enough resources behind it to put a lot of games into the ecosystem.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Price Debate &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xbox One will compete against Sony Corp. (6758)'s
            coming PlayStation 4, which also will be selling by the holidays, in addition to consoles, tablets and other
            devices that have eaten away at the traditional video-game market. Nintendo Co. (7974)'s Wii U, released in
            November, sells for about $300 in the U.S. and has missed sales targets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox Live
            service, content partnerships with the NFL, access to Skype video calls and unique features such as the
            SmartGlass app that allows users to switch between screens set Microsoft apart, Mattrick said in an
            interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're overdelivering value against other choices,' Mattrick said. 'Any
            modern product these days, when you look at it, $499 isn't a ridiculous price point.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            Microsoft showed a lot of games, the high price could work against it, Blau said. In the last generation of
            consoles, Sony's PlayStation 3 lost its lead pursuing a similar premium pricing strategy. The Wii sold the
            most units in that generation and the Xbox has sold the most in the past two years or so. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's
            a huge price increase,' Blau said. 'Creating that premium product hasn't really worked in the games
            industry. I'm skeptical.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Loyal Users &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox one will probably
            be subsidized, said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. He said Microsoft is
            probably calculating it can fetch the higher price for the first 10 million units, pulling in an extra $1
            billion, and it can cut the price if it has to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It will come out of the pockets of
            their most faithful,' Pachter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 ranges from about $199 to $299,
            depending on accessories bundled with it, such as Kinect. Microsoft unveiled a new, slimmer version of the
            current-generation machine today at E3. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Special Features' &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xbox
            One titles include 'Forza Motorsport 5,' which takes advantage of the console's social capabilities to
            create an avatar that learns the player's driving habits and stands in for them to keep playing while
            they're away, for example at work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another title called 'Project Spark' allows users to
            create their own games. The company also played up integration with the SmartGlass app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers
            are looking for the first new consoles in almost seven years to pull the video-game industry out of a
            two-year slump in retail sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Our goal is to make sure that we really do take
            advantage of whatever special features the machines are going to bring,' said Tony Key, vice president of
            sales and marketing at Ubisoft SA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After some gamers criticized Microsoft for its lack
            of clarity on used games and how new ones will be played, the company said last week consumers may sell
            their games back to retailers or give them to friends, provided they have approval from the publisher. All
            games must be authenticated at least once every 24 hours to continue playing, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Stock Rise &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Reseburg, a spokesman for Electronic Arts (EA), and Alan
            Lewis, a spokesman for Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO)., declined to comment on whether their
            companies would place limits on used games sales, trade-ins or swaps among friends. A spokeswoman for
            Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), the largest publisher, didn't return a e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 0.6 percent to $35.47 at the close in New York. The
            stock has gained 33 percent this year, compared with an advance of 15 percent for the Standard Poor's 500
            Index. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Sony Unveils PlayStation 4 Console Taking on Microsoft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758) unveiled the PlayStation 4, its first new console in seven years, taking the
            battle to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT) with a lower-priced machine, original content and fresh titles as it
            targets a return to video-game dominance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The PS4 will cost $399 in the U.S., 20 percent
            less than Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony executives said yesterday at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los
            Angeles. The machine, with sharp edges and blue highlights, allows unlimited used-game sales and doesn't
            require an Internet connection, a contrast to two unpopular Microsoft features. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            console is crucial to Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai's plan to turn around Tokyo-based Sony's
            electronics business. A successful PS4 would bolster Hirai's financial resources as he focuses on making
            television manufacturing profitable after nine years of losses. Sony won the first round, according to
            Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We now think Sony and
            its PS4 have the edge over Microsoft's Xbox One,' Thong wrote in a report today. 'The PS4 offers gamers a
            more powerful machine at $100 cheaper than the Xbox One.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To expand sales, Sony and
            Microsoft are looking to broaden their audiences beyond gamers by adding music, films and TV shows, with
            some of that content exclusive. The challenge for both companies is to capture mainstream consumers, who
            would otherwise play on smartphones or tablets, without alienating serious gamers. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sony Outduels Microsoft in First PS4-Xbox One Skirmish</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758)'s PlayStation 4 won the initial skirmish over next-generation video-game consoles
            by exploiting the weak spots in Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s plan for the Xbox One: price and used-game
            policies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In dueling press conferences this week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in
            Los Angeles, Sony and Microsoft each made their pitch to the serious gamers whose opinions set the trend in
            the $37 billion market for console-based video games and hardware. Then customers were able to start
            reserving the new console of their choice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result has been a rapid shift in
            expectations for the two machines, with Sony gaining the upper hand with fans and early sales against
            Microsoft, the console leader for the past two years. The Xbox One will sell for a premium-priced $499 and
            limit users' ability to buy, trade and resell games. Sony, once dominant in the industry, came in $100
            cheaper and won't limit transactions, and has been rewarded with a boom in orders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Sony
            essentially kicked Microsoft's ass,' said Gabe Bethke, 19, a sophomore at Occidental College in Los Angeles,
            who watched online and owns an Xbox 360. 'A lot of people who are hardcore gamers are going to be turned off
            by the Xbox One. It has too many rules and restrictions.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sony Beats Microsoft in U.S. Console Sales for Fifth Month</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758)'s PlayStation 4 beat Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Xbox One in sales of consoles in
            U.S. stores in May, extending its lead for a fifth month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall consumer spending on
            video-game hardware and software jumped 52 percent to $586 million last month, compared with a year earlier,
            with the PS4 retaining its sales lead as the No. 1 platform, NPD Group Inc. said in an e-mailed statement
            today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft last week began selling a lower-priced version of its Xbox One to match
            the $399 price of Sony's PS4. The company had struggled to convince gamers that the $499 price tag of the
            console is justified. Both companies showcased new titles for the machines at the industry's annual E3
            conference earlier this month, as they gear up for the year-end holiday season. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony has
            led Microsoft in U.S. console sales every month since the new devices were released in November. At the E3
            conference in Los Angeles, Microsoft used its entire presentation to focus on hard-core players, who were
            alienated by an Xbox One debut last year focused on non-game entertainment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S.
            hardware sales in May almost doubled to $187 million, while revenue from software excluding titles for PCs
            gained 57 percent to $274 million. The increase in game sales was the first after six months of declines and
            helped overall sales jump the most since June 2008, according to NPD. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Unveils Machine Learning Service for Prediction</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is introducing a new
            Internet-based service that helps companies use data analysis to
            predict behavior, in a bid to gain more customers in the fast-growing field of machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The service lets users more easily build algorithms to
            predict purchasing patterns, electricity usage and more. The
            work and results can be hosted on the Web through Microsoft's
            Azure cloud offering. The new product, dubbed Azure Machine
            Learning, has been in a trial period for about a year and now
            has about 100 customers testing it, said General Manager Eron
            Kelly. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, under new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella,
            is trying to boost its focus on cloud software as more companies
            gravitate to hosting data and other operations on the Web.
            Nadella ran the cloud business before becoming CEO in February.
            The Redmond, Washington-based software maker wants to bolster
            usage of Azure as it tries to narrow the gap with market leader
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)'s Web Services business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Machine learning, which is an artificial intelligence field
            that involves constructing systems that automatically analyze
            and learn from data, has been on the rise. Even as companies
            collect more information, the challenge has been how to extract
            value from it. As a result, the market for analysis software is
            growing about 18 percent a year and will reach $6.5 billion by
            2019, according to Transparency Market Research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Data Scientists &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'One of the challenges is as you create more data -- data
            in and itself isn't all that valuable,' Kelly said. 'It's the
            insights you can create from it, and as the datasets get larger,
            it becomes harder to analyze.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said its new product can be used by full-fledged
            data scientists to speed up their work, as well as by analysts
            who aren't trained in the mathematical underpinnings of the
            field. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's own retail stores are using the software to
            predict fraud, while another unnamed retailer is analyzing past
            customer purchases to decide future inventory, said Kelly.
            Carnegie Mellon University is tracking weather patterns and
            electricity usage in its buildings and has told Microsoft the
            system will enable them to save 30 percent on energy, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will offer a public preview of the service, which
            was code-named Project Passau, in July. It's the product of work
            from the company's research unit and its data platform team,
            helmed by Joseph Sirosh, a machine-leaning executive who
            Microsoft hired from Amazon in July 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Soon machine learning will help to drastically reduce
            wait times in emergency rooms, predict disease outbreaks and
            predict and prevent crime,' Sirosh wrote in a blog post. 'To
            realize that future we need to make machine learning more
            accessible.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most-valuable technology company, received as many as 5,000 requests
            for customer information from U.S. law enforcement authorities amid widening revelations of government data
            collection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 9,000 and 10,000 accounts or devices were specified in the requests
            between Dec. 1 and May 31, the Cupertino, California-based company said in a statement. Facebook Inc. (FB)
            and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said they received thousands of warrants for data from government entities during
            the second half of 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The role of technology companies has come under scrutiny since
            Edward Snowden, a computer technician who did work for the National Security Agency, disclosed this month
            that the NSA is collecting data under a U.S. government program code-named PRISM. The project traces its
            roots to warrantless domestic-surveillance efforts under former President George W. Bush. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Like
            several other companies, we have asked the U.S. government for permission to report how many requests we
            receive related to national security and how we handle them,' Apple said in the statement. 'We have been
            authorized to share some of that data, and we are providing it here in the interest of transparency.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft last week began selling a lower-priced version of
            its Xbox One to match the $399 price of Sony's PS4. The company
            had struggled to convince gamers that the $499 price tag of the
            console is justified. Both companies showcased new titles for
            the machines at the industry's annual E3 conference earlier this
            month, as they gear up for the year-end holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of GameStop Corp. (GME), the largest seller of consoles
            and video-game titles in the U.S., rose 6.8 percent to $40.29 at
            the close in New York. The Grapevine, Texas-based company is
            depending on the new generation of consoles to boost sales in an
            industry that's been hurt as consumers have shifted to playing
            games on social networks and mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Well Positioned' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'GameStop is well positioned to benefit from a renewed
            growth period within the console video game industry driven by
            adoption of the PS4 and Xbox One,' Michael Olson, an analyst at
            Piper Jaffray Cos., said in a note yesterday. Past declines in
            industry software sales 'are largely cyclically driven and the
            industry is poised to grow sustainably in late '14,' said
            Olson, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the retailer's
            shares. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Says Looked at Connecting Search, Shopping</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) recently canceled an
            early stage project looking at ways to combine its Bing Web
            search with shopping, the company said without explaining why
            the effort was abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The project was a small scale incubation effort to enable
            a more direct commerce model between customers and brands and
            merchants,' the largest software maker said in a statement.
            'The project was recently canceled, but we remain committed to
            finding new and differentiated ways to enable a richer, more
            task-oriented approach to e-commerce and online advertising.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Bing search engine, which lags market-dominating rival Google Inc. (GOOG), has
            experimented for several years
            with shopping programs, including an effort that ended in 2010
            which gave customers cash back on purchases. Besides increasing
            search traffic, Microsoft has looked at options for bolstering
            an ailing display advertising business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The project, called Brazil, and its cancellation were
            reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal, which described it
            as effort to compete with online retailer Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and
            Web marketplace EBay Inc. (EBAY) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said in its
            statement that it's 'inaccurate to characterize Project Brazil
            as conceived to compete with Amazon or EBay.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>GameStop Jumps as Microsoft Changes Games Trading Stance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;GameStop Corp. (GME), the largest video-game specialty retailer, rose to its highest price in more
            than
            four years after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reversed a policy that would
            have curbed trading and reselling of used games on its Xbox One
            unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;GameStop, based in Grapevine, Texas, jumped 6.3 percent to
            $40.94 at the close, its highest price since Sept. 12, 2008. The
            stock has risen 63 percent this year compared with an 11 percent
            gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said yesterday it will drop curbs on reselling,
            trading and lending used titles and the need for regular
            Internet connections on its Xbox One in order to play disc-based
            games. Sony Corp.'s rival new PlayStation 4 console doesn't have
            any game transaction limits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Pre-owned games, which GameStop customers trade in for new
            versions, were 31 percent of first-quarter revenue, while new
            ones represented more than 37 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 will go on sale in the
            U.S. in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Joins Merck in Pitch for Tech-Friendly Tax Code</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Merck Co. (MRK) Inc.,
            Amgen Inc. and other technology-focused companies are joining
            forces to seek U.S. tax code changes that wouldn't put at a
            disadvantage income earned from patents and intangible assets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies are part of the newly formed Tax Innovation
            Equality Coalition, whose other members include Xilinx Inc. (XLNX),
            Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) and Netflix Inc. (NFLX) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Washington-based group, which announced its formation
            today, is responding to proposals -- including one from House
            Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp -- that would apply different
            tax rules to income earned from intangible assets. Changes to
            those laws could raise these companies' taxes to pay for lighter
            burdens on the foreign income of all U.S.-based multinational
            corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It only makes sense that any tax reform proposal would
            try to cut the benefits of the members of this coalition,
            because they have the lowest effective tax rates,' said Martin
            Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts in Falls Church,
            Virginia. 'This coalition is playing defense.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Camp, a Michigan Republican, this month endorsed a carrot-and-stick approach that would apply a 15
            percent immediate tax
            to such income regardless of where it's earned. That would give
            the companies a tax increase abroad and a tax cut at home. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;25% Rate &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other corporate income would be subject to a 25 percent
            rate on domestic profits and almost no U.S. tax on foreign
            income. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Companies would feel less pressure to shift income to
            low-tax jurisdictions because that income would be taxed at the
            same rate -- whether it is earned in the United States or
            Bermuda,' Camp said at a June 13 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the current U.S. tax system, companies can move
            intangible assets derived from intellectual property across
            borders and can structure their businesses in ways that minimize
            foreign taxes. They can then avoid U.S. taxes by keeping the
            money overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The TIE Coalition is the latest in a series of groups that
            have formed as Congress considers a rewrite of the U.S. tax
            code. Other groups are focusing on the corporate tax rate and
            changing international tax rules. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The coalition isn't advocating or opposing a particular
            plan, said Mark Nebergall, president of the Washington-based
            Software Finance Tax Executives Council. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'All these proposals, with a few exceptions, seem to pick
            on intangible property,' he said. 'Proposals that do not
            discriminate against intangibles are the ones that deserve the
            most scrutiny.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Tax Credits &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Congress should be careful not to impose tax changes that
            could cost jobs in industries reliant on intellectual property,
            said Matthew Slaughter, a Dartmouth College professor who
            conducted a study for the coalition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'In many ways, tax policy being one, there are literally
            dozens of other countries in the world that are moving
            aggressively to try to build their capacity' in these
            industries, he said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The current U.S. system already gives these companies
            breaks, Sullivan said. They are eligible for the research tax
            credit and can take advantage of the mobility of intangible
            assets, which can be transferred more easily than factories. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's hard to value and it's hard to locate,' Sullivan
            said, 'and so that makes it easy to put a lot of profit into a
            tax haven.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>If Microsoft Builds It, Will They Come? At Cannes Ad Fest, Yes</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Is the house that Windows built reinventing itself as an ad giant? At an advertising industry
            confab in Cannes last week, Microsoft constructed a huge white box on the beach just off the city's
            Promenade de la Croisette boardwalk to woo executives from hundreds of companies, like Coca-Cola and Toyota
            Motor, and ad agencies such as Publicis Groupe. The point was to show off Microsoft's latest technologies --
            and emphasize what great advertising vehicles they make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's the new Xbox One, which
            will hit stores in November. The video-game console uses its built-in camera to detect a person's heart
            rate, whether she's happy, and which muscles are doing the most work during exercise games. And of course,
            Microsoft was quick to point out the ad space available on the home screen where users choose games, films,
            music and television channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second display featured a retail service that lets home
            shoppers see 3-D images of housewares like lamps and sofas in different colors and shapes, which can be
            saved to a wish list. When you enter a store, the application downloads the list of that company's products
            to your phone. And if you're out at the mall while your partner is at home, you can video chat to choose the
            stuff you want. Once you've finally agreed what to buy, you can pay for it using the app.&lt;/p&gt;

            company already provides several of these services. The new
            program will help bring cohesion to the effort, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'By unifying our various efforts, we will give
            entrepreneurs a single point of entry to engage with

        <headline>IPhone Microsoft Office Not Worth Wait: Rich Jaroslovsky</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's long-anticipated Office Mobile app for Apple (AAPL)'s iOS operating system turns out to
            be a total non-event. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever since the iPhone ushered in the era of ubiquitous mobile
            computing -- and especially since the release of the first iPad began a shift away from traditional personal
            computers -- the question has been whether and how Microsoft Office would adapt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's
            the answer: Grudgingly, and not very well. Office Mobile, which slipped into Apple's App Store with little
            fanfare, turns out to be a stripped-down add-on that will leave both Office and Apple users wondering, 'Is
            that all there is?' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Office Mobile is technically free. But it's useless unless you've
            already paid at least $100 for a year of Office 365, Microsoft (MSFT)'s effort to convert its traditional
            shrink-wrapped, purchase-one-time-only software business into a pay-as-you-go subscription model. (By
            contrast, the version of Office Mobile included on devices running Microsoft's own Windows Phone software
            doesn't require an Office 365 subscription.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's just one of the limitations the
            company has imposed on its iOS app. Another is that it's intended only for the iPhone; there's no separate
            version designed to take advantage of the iPad's larger display. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Gets Facebook App for Windows 8</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. (FB) is building an application for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Windows 8, adding one of
            the most popular programs missing from the operating system designed to help the software maker gain tablet
            customers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flipboard Inc., which lets users combine articles into a digital magazine,
            and the National Football League will also create apps for Windows 8, Microsoft Chief Executive Officer
            Steve Ballmer said at a conference today in San Francisco. There are now more than 100,000 apps for Windows
            8. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft commanded just 3.7 percent of the tablet market in the first quarter as a
            lack of some high-profile features, including a Facebook app, limited the appeal of Windows 8 and the
            software maker's Surface tablet. Twitter's app for Windows 8 was released in March. Microsoft is courting
            developers and adding features to Windows 8 to gain share in a tablet market dominated by Apple Inc. and
            Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft today released a test version of its Windows 8.1
            software, which restores some old Windows features, like a start button and rolls out new ones in a bid to
            reignite interest in its flagship operating system. Some customers had complained about the software's
            usability without the familiar start button. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The finished version of Windows 8.1 will be
            available later this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flipboard plans to release its app, and a version for Windows
            Phone, later this year, Eric Feng, chief technology officer for the developer, said in an interview. The NFL
            program is a fantasy football app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares rose 2 percent to $34.35 at the
            close in New York, leaving them up 29 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;-- Editors: Lisa Rapaport,

        <headline>Microsoft Seeks End to Dinosaur-Era Software Upgrade Cycle: Tech</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp (MSFT)., which for decades has refreshed its popular Office corporate software just
            once about every three years, says it will soon switch to weekly updates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's a radical
            shift as Microsoft overhauls its Internet-based programs, seeking to stay in sync with the fast-changing
            technology industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For much of Microsoft's 38-year history, infrequent upgrades made
            sense for businesses seeking predictable improvements. That's changed as nimbler entrants such as Dropbox
            Inc., Box Inc., Jive Software Inc (JIVE) (JIVE). and Google Inc. refine features and deliver automatic
            updates over the Web. That tinkering has helped lure customers and put pressure on margins at Microsoft's
            biggest division, which accounted for $24 billion in sales last year, or a third of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft, on this every-three-year schedule for the massive wave of new products, looks like a
            dinosaur,' said Melissa Webster, an analyst at market-research firm IDC, based in Framingham, Massachusetts.
            'Three years is a lifetime in tech these days.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That message has gotten through. Within
            a year, users of Internet-based versions of Office productivity software, as well as e-mail, telephony and
            collaboration tools, will have parts of their software refreshed weekly, Jeff Teper, an Office vice
            president, said in an interview. Microsoft has been moving toward more frequent updates with other programs,
            including Windows. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>AudioCodes Rides Microsoft Wave to Beat Nasdaq: Israel Overnight</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC), the Israeli company
            whose Internet calling technology is used by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is
            beating the biggest telecommunications companies on the Nasdaq
            market on prospects demand for its products will boost sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of AudioCodes advanced 11 percent in February,
            extending its rally in the past six months to 186 percent and
            making the Lod, Israel-based company the best performer on the
            Nasdaq Telecommunications Index. The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity
            Index (ISRA25BN) of the largest U.S.-traded Israeli equities in New York
            dropped for a third week, led by Allot Communications Ltd. and
            Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AudioCodes, which supplies Internet voice call products to
            Microsoft, is benefiting from plans by the world's largest
            software maker to catch up with Cisco Systems Inc. in the
            Internet telephony and communications market, which Forrester
            Research Inc. (FORR) predicts will reach $14.5 billion in 2015.
            AudioCodes will probably report in 2013 the fastest revenue
            growth in three years, according to Oppenheimer Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The Microsoft people are crazy excited about it, and
            there is a real opportunity here for AudioCodes to make a name
            for themselves,' Andrew Uerkwitz, an analyst at Oppenheimer,
            said by phone from New York on Feb. 28. 'This company really
            had an identity crisis, and once AudioCodes got its strategy
            figured out, investors came back to it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shares of AudioCodes gained 0.1 percent to 15.30 shekels,
            or the equivalent of $4.11, at the close in Tel Aviv today. The
            benchmark TA-25 Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,216.09. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Internet Phones &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;AudioCodes plunged to a three-year low of $1.37 in August,
            as sales slumped for six consecutive quarters. The company's
            focus on Microsoft's Lync communications system has lured back
            investors that had abandoned the stock as its price tumbled 45
            percent during 2011 and 2012, Uerkwitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Revenue from Microsoft's Lync program, which offers
            corporate phone, video and instant messaging services, grew 35
            percent in the second quarter, according to a Jan. 24 earnings
            call. The Redmond, Washington-based company has about 5 million
            Lync users, with revenue from the segment nearing $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales of AudioCodes' Lync products, which range from
            Internet handsets to call recording software, may grow as much
            as 40 percent in 2013, Uerkwitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge retreated 0.3 percent to
            87.26 last week as the TA-25 (TA-25) index increased 0.3 percent to
            1,221.47. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Allot, the Hod Hasharon, Israel-based maker of products
            that track wireless traffic, declined 9.9 percent to $13.09 in
            the week, making it the worst performer on the Bloomberg Israel-
            US gauge. The shares in Tel Aviv dropped 8.4 percent to 48.75
            shekels, or $13.10, today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Stopped Spending' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Procera Networks Inc. (PKT), a U.S. competitor that also helps
            cable companies and mobile operators report on network traffic,
            plunged 32 percent last week as its fourth-quarter earnings and
            revenue missed analysts' estimates. Slumping growth at Fremont,
            California-based Procera may signal a broader slowdown in the
            industry, Wedbush Securities Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The customers have stopped spending temporarily,' Sanjit Singh, a New York-based analyst at
            Wedbush who rates Allot (ALLT)
            shares neutral, said by phone on March 1. 'It's not that the
            projects are going away, we just don't know when they're going
            to land.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mellanox dropped 3.1 percent to $51.19 in its fourth
            consecutive week of declines, while shares traded in Tel Aviv
            slipped 0.4 percent to 191.5 shekels, or $51.39, in the week
            ended Feb. 28. The stock was the worst-performing company on the
            TA-25 Index in the last six months with a 59 percent plunge
            through Friday. Mellanox shares gained 0.1 percent to 191.60
            shekels, or $51.47, in Tel Aviv today. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google, Samsung Said to Express Microsoft-Nokia Concern to China</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) and Samsung Electronics
            Co. (005930) joined Chinese mobile phone makers in expressing concern to
            China that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s bid to take over Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s phone
            business may result in higher patent licensing fees, two
            government officials familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google and Samsung asked China's Ministry of Commerce to
            make sure that the 5.44 billion euro ($7.5 billion) bid doesn't
            result in higher fees on wireless technology patents that will
            remain with Nokia, the two officials said, asking not to be
            identified because the request wasn't made public. They're also
            concerned Microsoft will gain more power over the smartphone
            market and may abuse its patents, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The two companies join domestic vendors including Huawei
            Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. that asked China's regulators to
            set conditions on the deal, according to the officials.
            Microsoft and Nokia announced the deal in September after the
            Finnish company lost ground in the smartphone market to Apple
            Inc. (AAPL)'s iPhone and devices running Google's Android platform. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Microsoft is buying the hardware business
            while leaving most of the wireless patents in Nokia's control.
            Microsoft won European Union approval for the bid on Dec. 4,
            while regulators said they would monitor Nokia's licensing
            practices after the close of the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's Ministry of Commerce is conducting an anti-monopoly
            review and is likely to approve the deal, the officials said.
            The question is whether the ministry will demand the companies
            guarantee that the agreement doesn't result in higher patent
            fees, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Ministry Review &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google spokesman Taj Meadows and Samsung spokeswoman Jini
            Park declined to comment on whether their companies had raised
            any such concerns with regulators in China. Two phone calls
            today to the press office of the Ministry of Commerce in Beijing
            went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This merger application is currently under MOFCOM's
            review and we have no further comment,' Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said in an
            e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ZTE Corp. (763) plans to add Windows Phone devices to its
            offerings, Microsoft said last month. Samsung Electronics Co.
            and Huawei Technologies Co. already make Windows phones. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The portion of mobile phones running Windows is projected
            to almost double to 7 percent in 2018, from 3.9 percent this
            year, Framingham, Massachusetts-based market researcher
            International Data Corp. reported in February. The share running
            Google's Android system will drop to 76 percent, from 78.9
            percent in the same period, IDC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Is Said to Shake Up Staff With Penn's Appointment</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, in an effort to
            reignite growth, is shuffling management and putting former political operative Mark Penn in the new role of
            chief strategy officer, according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tony Bates,
            who was passed over for the CEO job, is leaving the company, with Eric Rudder, the head of advanced
            strategy, taking over his duties, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven't
            been announced. Tami Reller, the executive vice president in charge of marketing, is also leaving and being
            replaced by Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela, the people said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shakeup is the
            most extensive yet for Nadella, who was named CEO in February after a five-month search and is tasked with
            speeding up a turnaround at the world's biggest software maker. He'll be leaning on a former political
            strategist in Penn, who worked on Hillary Clinton's failed 2008 presidential bid. More recently, Penn, 60,
            developed Microsoft's 'Don't Get Scroogled' advertising campaign, a political-style attack on rival Google
            Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'He's aggressive,' Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., said of
            Penn. 'Maybe this will add a little testosterone to the organization to counter the fact that Satya is more
            of a deep thinker.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s newly appointed
            Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, in an effort to reignite
            growth, is shuffling management and putting former political
            operative Mark Penn in the new role of chief strategy officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Tony Bates, who was passed over for the CEO job, is leaving
            the company, with Eric Rudder, the head of advanced strategy,
            taking over his duties on an interim basis, Microsoft said today
            in a memo to employees. Tami Reller, the executive vice
            president in charge of marketing, is also leaving and being
            replaced by Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shakeup is the most extensive yet for Nadella, who was
            named CEO in February after a five-month search and is tasked
            with speeding up a turnaround at the world's biggest software
            maker. He'll be leaning on a former political strategist in
            Penn, who worked on Hillary Clinton's failed 2008 presidential
            bid. More recently, Penn, 60, developed Microsoft's 'Don't Get
            Scroogled' advertising campaign, a political-style attack on
            Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'He's aggressive,' Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford
            C. Bernstein Co., said of Penn. 'Maybe this will add a little
            testosterone to the organization to counter the fact that Satya
            is more of a deep thinker.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Penn's background is in public relations -- he spent six
            years as CEO of Burson-Marsteller. His aggressive style puts him
            at odds with some managers, who were uncomfortable with the
            Scroogled campaign, said people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Super Bowl Ad &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He's also helped develop less controversial ads like
            Microsoft's first national Super Bowl commercial this year. In
            the ad, former football player Steve Gleason, who suffers from
            amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and can't speak, narrated
            using Microsoft technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'His focus on using data to quickly evaluate and evolve
            our campaigns has driven new insights and understanding,'
            Nadella said in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Part of Penn's job will involve helping the company decide
            where to invest, and he will join the product leadership team,
            said a person with knowledge of the change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The overhaul follows last month's announcement that
            hardware group chief Julie Larson-Green will move to the
            applications and services unit. Thom Gruhler, a vice president
            who oversaw Windows and Windows Phone marketing, will lead
            marketing for the applications and services group, people with
            knowledge of the matter said. Reller notified employees of that
            change in an e-mail, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Laggard &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent to $37.78 at the close in
            New York. The stock has risen 3.9 percent since Nadella's
            appointment on Feb. 4, and has trailed the Standard Poor's 500
            Index in three of the past four years. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran, is the company's
            third CEO after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He's charged with
            accelerating expansion at a company that hasn't seen sales
            growth exceed 6 percent since 2011. Microsoft's investments in
            mobile haven't put a dent in Google and Apple Inc.'s control of
            the smartphone market, while cloud applications from competitors
            pose an increasing threat to Microsoft's flagship Windows
            business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Nadella is trying things out,' said Moerdler, who has
            the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft. He said he expects
            additional changes in senior leadership, including possible
            outside hires. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Job Split &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Bates was among the leading internal candidates for the top
            job, along with Nadella and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner. Bates, a former Cisco Systems Inc.
            executive, ran
            Microsoft's Skype unit before becoming an executive vice
            president in July. He doesn't have another job lined up and
            plans to take some time to figure out his next move, said a
            person familiar with his plans. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Reller, who joined Microsoft in 2001, was also promoted to
            executive vice president in July and led marketing for the
            Windows 8 operating system. Capossela had been named chief
            marketing officer back in 2011, though his role was reduced in
            July when Ballmer split marketing between Reller and Penn, with
            the latter taking on advertising strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Penn's ties to the Clintons date back to the 1990s and his
            work in the re-election campaign for President Bill Clinton. He
            worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign until April 2008, when he
            came under fire for his firm's role in promoting trade with
            Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, Penn has a longstanding relationship with
            Ballmer and Gates and advised the company during its antitrust
            case with the U.S. government. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Unveils Office App With Search, Social Features</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is unveiling a new
            Web-based Office application that uses search and social data to
            display a user's most important files and projects, seeking to
            boost sales and fend off competition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The app, code-named Oslo, has versions for Windows 8, the
            Internet and mobile devices, including those based on Apple
            Inc.'s and Google Inc.'s software for smartphones and tablets,
            Jeff Teper, a Microsoft vice president, said in an interview.
            The first Oslo programs, probably for Windows 8 and the Web,
            will be available in the second half of 2014, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft wants to move more customers to cloud-based
            versions of its Office productivity software, which are
            delivered via the Internet, in order to boost growth and fend
            off similar applications. Cloud programs are sold as
            subscriptions, providing more regular sales compared with the
            cycle of customers buying a version of Office every few years,
            said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'On the corporate side, they have a belief they can
            significantly differentiate the Microsoft offering from others
            with search and social features,' Moerdler said. 'They want to
            make Office massively more interactive.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The product incorporates features from two Microsoft
            acquisitions: The 2012 purchase of Yammer Inc., which provides
            social-networking tools for companies, and the acquisition in
            2008 of Norway's Fast Search Transfer ASA, a search technology
            developer. The Oslo code name is a nod to the Norwegian unit's
            team. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Office Graph &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead of opening Outlook, Word or Excel, users of the new
            app will have a dashboard of projects and files they're working
            on, as well as topics they should know about and those popular
            among co-workers. Oslo will also let users search by categories,
            such as 'modified by me,' 'shared with me' and 'trending
            around me.' Clicking on a colleague brings up not just that
            person's manager, peers and direct reports, but others working
            on projects across an entire company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Underlying Oslo is what Microsoft is calling the Office
            Graph, an idea similar to the social graph, a term popularized
            by Facebook Inc. for the depiction of personal relationships,
            said Adam Pisoni, the Yammer co-founder who is now a Microsoft
            vice president. The Office graph would act as a repository of
            data culled from a user's social relationships and actions.
            Microsoft will also open up the data so other business-software
            developers can create apps that can exchange such information
            between Office and their programs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the Office unit now part of the same business as
            Microsoft's Bing search, future versions of Oslo will integrate
            Web-search data from Bing, said Teper. Microsoft is still
            working on pricing and will begin testing the software with a
            few chosen customers in the next month or so, Teper said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Don't think of this as the version of Word you've got on
            your machine,' Teper said. 'It's a really new experience for
            how the office should work.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ballmer Says Microsoft a 'Two-Trick Pony,' Working on Third</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s former Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said he's sorry he didn't
            combine hardware and software development sooner after the company missed out on Apple Inc.'s smartphone
            success. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The thing I regret is that we didn't put the hardware and the software
            together soon enough,' Ballmer said in a talk at Oxford University's Said Business School today. Still, 'if
            you really want to bring a vision to market, it is helpful to be able to conceive and deliver the hardware
            and the software. Our company is in the process of building new muscle.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the
            world's largest software maker fell behind in mobile, Microsoft has had more success than most and is
            building up the capabilities to catch up, he said. Ballmer stepped down from the CEO role at Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft last month, replaced by the company's head of enterprise and cloud services,
            Satya Nadella, after a five-month search. Ballmer remains on the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'You're pretty
            genius in our business if you're a one-trick pony,' Ballmer said. 'In our company, I'm very proud of the
            fact that we've done at least two tricks. Tricks are worth billions and billions of dollars.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Those two tricks were the invention of the modern personal computer, with its Windows operating
            system and Office software, and bringing microprocessor technology into data centers, he said. For the next,
            Ballmer agreed to a $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit in September, accelerating
            Microsoft's expansion into hardware. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Excessive Price? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a note
            today, credit-ratings company Fitch Ratings called the price Microsoft is paying for Nokia's handset
            business 'excessive.' The firm cited a deterioration in the user base for Windows-based phones and said
            Microsoft may incur significant future severance costs from the deal, though it also said the acquisition is
            'a function of strategic necessity.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer said it's also tricky to measure success at
            new technology companies. He pointed to Facebook Inc.'s $19 billion deal for the messaging platform WhatsApp
            Inc. as an example of how difficult it can be to value increasingly cheap-to-build startups. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If
            your goal was to sell the company, they had the right goal set -- low cost to 450 million, or whatever the
            heck number of users, and sell for $19 billion,' Ballmer said. 'Is it a fad? Well, probably not. I don't
            know whether they'll be successful or not, but you do have to really sit there and say, what's my goal? Will
            that asset ever be worth anything?' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cost of starting up companies for cloud-based
            services is becoming cheaper, and companies should look beyond user numbers to measure success. WhatsApp
            will ultimately be deemed successful when they convert their user base into something that generates 'enough
            revenue to pay off.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft's Nadella Manages Legacy of Ballmer-Board Split</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;As Satya Nadella puts his stamp on Microsoft Corp., he's coming to grips with the tug of war over
            strategy and the clash of personalities that marked Steve Ballmer's final years at the helm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella,
            who succeeded Ballmer one month ago, took a step this week by unraveling part of a restructuring his
            predecessor put in place in one of his last acts as chief executive officer. Nadella appointed onetime
            Democratic political operative Mark Penn to the just-invented post of strategy chief and shuffled other
            executives to resolve an unwieldy setup Ballmer had established in the marketing department. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            new CEO is seeking to reshape a company whose main businesses are losing steam as efforts to expand on the
            Web and in mobile devices have been thwarted by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) Nadella will also
            exert his influence on the push into hardware, a strategy shift that fueled some of Ballmer's fiercest
            arguments with the board. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related: Ballmer Says Microsoft a 'Two-Trick Pony,' Working on

            exasperated they talked about how they might ease him out, including by hiring someone he admired, Ford
            Motor Co. CEO Alan Mulally, to succeed him, according to people with knowledge of the matter; Mulally later
            fell out of favor when members viewed him as behaving as though the job should be handed to him without so
            much as a formal interview, according to the people, who weren't authorized to speak publicly about the
            situation. A spokeswoman for Mulally declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Fined $731 Million by EU Over Browser Accord</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was fined 561
            million euros ($731 million) by European Union regulators for
            violating the terms of a settlement to give users a choice of
            web browsers aside from its Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Today's fine -- about 1 percent of the company's 2012
            revenues -- brings to 2.24 billion euros the penalties imposed
            on Microsoft in its EU antitrust clashes over the past decade,
            including an initial 899 million-euro fine for failing to obey
            an order to share data with competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker agreed in 2009 to offer
            access to other browsers as a part of a settlement to repair its
            relationship with the bloc's regulators. The company said last
            July it only learned that month that it didn't offer its browser
            choice software on some 28 million computers running Windows 7
            Service Pack 1, or 10 percent of the computers that should have
            received it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a big fine, but it's a big company and a
            sophisticated company that made a commitment and they failed to
            honor it,' said Charles Whiddington, a lawyer at Field Fisher
            Waterhouse LLP in London. 'Commitments are really important to
            the commission because they lubricate the efficiency of its
            policing of the rules.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft took 'full responsibility for the technical
            error that caused this problem and have apologized for it,' the
            company said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Candid Assessment' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We provided the commission with a complete and candid
            assessment of the situation, and we have taken steps to
            strengthen our software development and other processes to help
            avoid this mistake -- or anything similar -- in the future,'
            Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company fell 1.3 percent to
            $27.98 at 12:02 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer's yearly
            bonus was cut last year to $620,000, partly as a result of the
            company's browser problems with the EU and also due to the
            disappointing performance of its online services unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft ended more than 10 years of EU antitrust
            investigations with its 2009 pledge to give consumers who bought
            personal computers using its software a choice of the 12 most
            widely used browsers to install in addition to, or instead of,
            Internet Explorer. The company told regulators in December 2011
            that it was complying with its commitment to display a browser-
            choice screen to Windows operating system users. The new fine
            marks the first time a company has been sanctioned for failing
            to stick to the terms of a legally binding settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Think Twice &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said regulators
            were 'more naive than today' in letting Microsoft monitor its
            own compliance. In the future, the EU will detail what they
            expect from a trustee appointed to monitor a settlement and
            check reports more carefully, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I hope this decision will make companies think twice,'
            Almunia told reporters today. 'We trusted in the reports about
            the compliance.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) is negotiating its own settlement with EU
            regulators to end a probe into claims it discriminates against
            competitors in its search results. Microsoft, the operator of
            the Bing search engine, is one of several companies that have
            complained about Google's behavior. Almunia said last month that
            an accord could be finalized later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Fourth Penalty &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The penalty is the fourth levied on Microsoft since it was
            fined 497 million euros in 2004 for abusing its position as the
            world's largest supplier of desktop software to hinder rivals
            for server and media programs. It was fined 280.5 million euros
            in 2006 and another 899 million euros in 2008 for not supplying
            interoperability information to server rivals on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 899 million-euro penalty was reduced to 860 million
            euros by the EU's General Court last year. That fine is only
            exceeded by a 1.06 billion-euro sanction against Intel Corp.
            which is also being challenged in court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Mozilla Corp. General Counsel Harvey Anderson said in an
            October blog post that daily downloads of his company's Firefox
            browser fell by 63 percent prior to Microsoft fixing the
            browser-choice issue and that the company may have lost as many
            as 9 million potential downloads as a result of the glitch. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft was also warned by the EU last year to modify how
            it presents Internet Explorer in Windows 8 to avert another
            antitrust clash. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google's Chrome was the most popular web browser globally
            in February, with 37 percent of market share, according to
            statistics from web analytics firm StatCounter. Microsoft's
            Internet Explorer followed with 30 percent, while Mozilla's
            Firefox accounted for just over a fifth of users. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The event will be Nadella's first public appearance at a product rollout since he was appointed

            software remains a mainstay on personal computers, is trying to catch up in the mobile-software market.
            Microsoft released a paid version of Office for the iPhone last year and has various iPad applications, yet
            is grappling with how to balance helping Windows succeed on devices while selling software for rival
            products that dominate the market. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Ex-Microsoft Employee Charged With Trade Secret Theft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) employee
            was charged with stealing the software maker's trade secrets,
            including code for a program to protect against copyright
            infringement, and leaking them to a blogger in France. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alex Kibkalo, a Russian national, was arrested yesterday
            and ordered held without bail, according to federal court
            filings in Seattle. He admitted to Microsoft's investigators
            that he provided the confidential information to the blogger,
            according to the criminal complaint filed by U.S. prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft was alerted to the theft in 2012 by an
            individual, who asked that his identity wouldn't be disclosed
            and who had been contacted by the blogger to help examine code
            for the Microsoft Activation Server Software Development Kit, a
            product developed for internal Microsoft use only, according to
            the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's internal investigation traced the leaked
            information to Kibkalo, a seven-year employee who was working as
            a software architect in Lebanon, prosecutors said. He has been
            working for another U.S. technology company after he returned to
            Russia, according to the criminal complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Malicious Insiders' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Center for Responsible Enterprise Trade, a
            Washington-based advocacy organization headed by former
            Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Pamela Passman, in February
            released a study on the economic effects of trade-secret theft.
            The study identified 'malicious insiders' as one of five
            categories of potential misappropriators of trade secrets. The
            others were nation states, competitors, transnational organized
            crime and what the report's authors called 'hactavists.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nokia Says Completion of Microsoft Deal Delayed Until April</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), working to complete the
            sale of its mobile-phone division to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), said the
            5.44 billion-euro ($7.5 billion) transaction will be delayed
            until next month as Asian regulators review it. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is buying the
            business and licensing some patents to challenge Apple Inc. and
            Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)'s dominance of the smartphone market.
            Espoo, Finland-based Nokia is selling the unprofitable unit to
            try to stem losses by focusing on wireless-network equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The companies had previously projected a completion by the
            end of March. The transaction is pending approvals from
            'certain antitrust authorities in Asia,' and the companies
            remain committed to the deal, Nokia said today. In a blog
            posting, Microsoft said the regulatory approval process is
            nearing the final stages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rival mobile-phone makers including Huawei Technologies Co.
            and Samsung have expressed concern to China that the deal may
            result in higher patent licensing fees, government officials
            familiar with the matter said this month. China's Ministry of
            Commerce is conducting an anti-monopoly review and is likely to
            approve the deal, the officials said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Unveils Office for IPad in Mobile-App Push</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he will 'hold nothing back' to get the
            company's programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker's longtime focus on its
            Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At his first public speech since taking the CEO job last
            month, Nadella unveiled Office software for Apple Inc.'s iPad, the first time Microsoft is putting the
            popular productivity programs onto the tablet. Nadella also said the company's goal is to get its
            Internet-based Office 365 service on any gadget, even if it reduces sales of Windows-based personal
            computers or other products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's not a tradeoff, because it's about going where
            customers are going,' Nadella said after the company event in San Francisco. 'It's not about today's share
            position based on today's form factors, because in the full arc of time there will be many new platforms
            that will require Office, from small screens to large screens.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella is presiding
            over Microsoft's shift to a more open approach. While former CEO Steve Ballmer kept more of a focus on
            Windows, including pushing the operating system onto smartphones, Nadella is indicating that he proactively
            wants to get Microsoft software onto Apple's iOS and Google Inc.'s Android-based gadgets. Since Apple and
            Android devices dominate in mobile, Microsoft risks having its software locked out if it can't sell its
            programs for those platforms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New Sheriff &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There is a new sheriff
            in town,' Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets Co., wrote in a note about Nadella's presentation.
            'We believe the Office for iPad was a major positive step in the right direction and signals a strategic
            change at Microsoft.' Ives has the equivalent of a hold on the stock. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares
            fell 1 percent to $39.36 at the close in New York. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Office for iPad, which now includes
            Word, PowerPoint and Excel, also heralds a new business model for the software, which has been a paid
            product. Now users will be able to view their Office documents for free on their iPad, though to edit or
            create documents they will need to pay $99 a year for a subscription to Office 365. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last
            year, Microsoft released paid versions of Office apps for the iPhone, which required a subscription to
            Office 365. That product cost $99.99 a year for a home version that works on five devices and $69.99 for a
            version that works for just one computer and one tablet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We're excited that Office is
            coming to iPad ' now part of the more than 500,000 apps designed specifically for iPad,' said Trudy Muller,
            a spokeswoman for Apple. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile, Cloud &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On his first day as CEO,
            Nadella emphasized the Redmond, Washington-based company's focus on devices and Web-based cloud services and
            said those priorities would 'define Microsoft going forward.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the event today,
            Nadella reiterated that the intersection of mobile and cloud is the 'most critical,' though he added that it
            was just 'one aspect of our overall strategy.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also rolled out technology to enable
            developers to create what he called a 'cloud for everyone on every device.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadella said
            Windows remains 'a massive agenda for us' and the company plans to innovate with the operating system. The
            CEO said Microsoft will unveil more of its strategy as soon as next week at its Build developer conference
            in San Francisco, where Windows will be front and center. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bigger Opportunity &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft is in the process of migrating the lion's share of its business to the cloud and
            subscription,' Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Co., wrote in a note to clients last week.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The iPad version of Office, a suite of software that includes Microsoft's Word, Excel,
            Outlook and other programs, may add $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue a
            year, Moerdler said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is taking a risk by asking people to pay $99 a year to
            edit, rather than just look at, their documents, said Milind Gadekar, CEO of CloudOn Inc., which makes a
            free mobile application that lets users access and edit their Office documents on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Consumers expect editing to be free,' he said. 'You have to find other advanced features to charge
            for.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milind said that while Microsoft is becoming more open, its new strategy still
            requires Office 365 users to use its OneDrive online storage system, rather than popular alternatives such
            as Dropbox, Box.net and Evernote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Productivity Programs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still,
            consumers are spending more than twice as much time using mobile productivity apps than they did a year ago,
            according to research measuring usage between January and March by Flurry, a mobile analytics firm which
            tracked usage on both phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft's announcement of Office for iPad
            couldn't be more timely,' the company said in a blog post. 'In fact, it can define Microsoft and its newly
            appointed CEO's tenure in the post-PC world.' The study included phones and tablets with both iOS and
            Android. 'This growth rate eclipsed all other categories including Messaging, Games and News.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Asked if selling Office on other devices would cause big changes in sales of Windows-based PCs,
            phones and tablets, Nadella said at the event, 'I would leave it to Wall Street to do the analysis, but we
            are going after huge opportunities that are ahead of us.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft's Nadella Makes Management Changes Before Build</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) New Chief Executive
            Officer Satya Nadella announced new leadership roles for Scott Guthrie and Phil Spencer, adding to
            management moves aimed at
            rebooting growth in cloud and devices at the world's largest
            software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nadella, who took over as CEO last month, wrote in an e-mail to employees that he had appointed
            Guthrie to lead
            company's cloud and enterprise organization. Spencer will run
            the Xbox business and former Nokia Oyj CEO Stephen Elop will
            join as executive vice president of the devices group when
            Microsoft completes its acquisition of Nokia's handset unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The CEO earlier this month named a chief strategy officer
            and disclosed the exits of several top executives. Nadella, who
            was promoted to replace Steve Ballmer, is lining up his
            leadership team as he seeks growth in devices and cloud
            services. Nadella is also replacing executives who've left after
            Ballmer's management overhaul in July and Nadella's own
            appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes among executives show 'how we're continuing to
            evolve and tune our organization for maximum focus and impact,'
            Nadella wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Guthrie, who has been named a new executive vice president,
            has been the acting head of the cloud unit for the past two
            months, replacing Nadella. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Spencer, who had previously overseen the company's video
            game and television studios, will add Xbox software and the Xbox
            Live online service and report to operating systems chief Terry Myerson. Marc Whitten, who left Microsoft
            this month, had
            previously been responsible for Xbox software and Xbox Live. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;CEO Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elop's role was initially announced in September when
            Microsoft unveiled the Nokia acquisition and initially included
            oversight of games and TV studios. Xbox hardware remains in
            Elop's group. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft holds its developer conference, called Build, in
            San Francisco this week. Last week, Nadella made his first
            public appearance since taking on his CEO job when he unveiled
            Microsoft Office software for Apple Inc.'s iPad. At the event,
            the CEO said he will 'hold nothing back' to get the Redmond,
            Washington-based company's programs across all devices, in a
            clear departure from the software maker's longtime focus on its
            Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Apple Can't Top Microsoft in $17 Billion Sale: Corporate Finance</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) paid higher interest rates
            on a record $17 billion bond sale than Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) did a
            week ago as the iPhone maker's slowing growth overshadowed
            annual cash flow that's more than twice the amount of the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Apple matched an unprecedented low coupon of 0.45
            percent for corporate three-year debt yesterday, investors
            demanded higher yields for the fixed-rate portions of five, 10-and 30-year securities relative to U.S.
            Treasuries than similar-maturity notes Microsoft issued on April 25. Apple, which gets
            more than half of its sales from the iPhone, plans to use the
            money to help finance $100 billion in dividends and buybacks
            after its shares plunged 44 percent in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Apple is probably seen as a marginally higher risk,'
            said Alan Shepard, an analyst and money manager at Madison
            Investment Advisors Inc., which oversees about $16 billion in
            Madison, Wisconsin, and owns the company's debt as well as that
            of Microsoft. 'They sell a premium product, but revenues aren't
            diversified enough.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As Apple transformed itself from a near-bankrupt personal-computer also-ran into the world's
            largest technology company,
            the Cupertino, California-based maker of iPad computer tablets
            and iPod music players has posted annual sales growth that's
            been about 10 times that of the Windows 8 designer over the past
            four years. For bondholders, Morningstar Inc. says competition
            from lower-cost mobile devices still makes Apple riskier than
            Microsoft, the world's largest software company. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft's Skype Infringed Patents, New York Firm Claims</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;A New York technology development
            company said it sued Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) over allegations the
            software maker's web-conferencing service, Skype, infringed
            encryption-related patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CopyTele Inc. (COPY) said it filed a complaint today in federal
            court in Brooklyn, New York, alleging that Skype infringed two
            patents for technology that helps maintain secure Web-based
            communications. CopyTele is seeking unspecified damages,
            according to a copy of the complaint provided by the firm. The
            filing couldn't be immediately confirmed in court records. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'These encryption patents are a prime example of the
            enormous, untapped potential at CTI,' CopyTele's Chief
            Executive Officer Robert Berman said in a statement. The patents
            have 'tremendous value' that was 'masked' under the previous
            management, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jimmy Knodel, a spokesman for Microsoft who works for
            Waggener Edstrom Worldwide, declined to comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Berman, formerly the chief operating officer of Acacia
            Research Corp. (ACTG), a publicly-traded intellectual property holding
            firm, said in an interview today that he was hired by CopyTele
            to turn the technology developer into a similar business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Acacia, based in Newport Beach, California, controls patent
            portfolios, licenses them to corporate users and sues companies
            that are alleged to have infringed the patents. The company says
            it controls rights to about 250 patent portfolios. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In January, CopyTele sued AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) in federal
            court in San Francisco, alleging the company stole patented
            technologies developed for e-readers. The case is pending. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CopyTele expects to acquire additional patents and file
            more lawsuits in the future, Berman said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft acquired Skype from an investment group for
            $8.5 billion in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Acer Says Microsoft Could Catch Up to Google, Apple in Mobile</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s operating system for mobile devices could become a serious competitor to
            Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. software in the next year, Acer Inc. (2353) President Jim Wong said today.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main thing holding the platform back is a lack of applications -- a failing that
            Microsoft is working to solve, Wong said in an interview after introducing a new line of Acer products in
            New York. Acer, the fourth-largest personal-computer maker, sells a range of PCs and tablets with Windows,
            though it doesn't offer any phones with Microsoft software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Windows for now is still a
            leader in the productivity field,' he said, referring to Microsoft's dominance in PCs and office software.
            Within the next year, the mobile version of the software is poised to mount a real challenge, he said. 'We
            have high hopes.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the PC industry in decline, Acer has an interest in its partner
            Microsoft making the transition to mobile devices. Global PC shipments tumbled 14 percent last quarter, the
            fourth straight period of decreases, according to research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, Microsoft
            hasn't made much of a dent in either smartphones or tablets. Windows accounted for less than 4 percent of
            tablet shipments in the first quarter, compared with 40 percent for Apple's iOS and almost 57 percent for
            Google's Android, according to IDC. In smartphones, Microsoft had 2.7 percent of the market at the end of
            last year. Android and Apple combined controlled more than 90 percent of shipments, IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the New York event, Acer unveiled four computing products, including a 7.9-inch Android
            mini-tablet and a convertible tablet that pairs with a keyboard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and ATT Inc. (T) are
            among U.S. borrowers selling the most bonds in Europe since the
            start of 2008, taking advantage of record-low borrowing costs
            that outstrip dollar rates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;American issuers raised 17.2 billion euros ($22.5 billion)
            from bond sales this year, nine times the amount for the same
            period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
            average yield on investment-grade euro corporate bonds fell to
            an unprecedented 1.75 percent yesterday, or 89 basis points
            below comparable dollar notes, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
            indexes show. That's the biggest discount since June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank cut its benchmark interest rate
            to a record 0.5 percent yesterday as it tries to lift the euro-
            region out of recession, encouraging companies to take advantage
            of cheap funding. In the U.S., where the economy is expanding at

            reduce its monthly bond buying in the fourth quarter as it
            begins to scale back its record stimulus, according to
            economists in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'U.S. companies will issue where they think they can
            borrow cheaply and where there's significant demand,' said
            Craig Veysey, the head of fixed income at Sanlam Private
            Investments Ltd. in London, part of the Sanlam Group, which
            oversees $72 billion of assets. 'The huge drop in yields we've
            seen over the last month, in particular in Europe, would have
            meant that it's easy for U.S. issuers to get their deals away.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft to Warn Users of Government Requests for Information</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will start giving
            users more information about government requests for data,
            seeking to provide greater transparency and reassure consumers
            about how their activities are being monitored. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft is updating its policy to expand routine
            notification of users about government requests for data, unless
            specifically prohibited by law,' Kathy Roeder, a spokeswoman
            for the Redmond, Washington-based company, said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Technology companies are changing their policies to offer
            more disclosure amid growing government demands for information
            about what people do online. Concerns over security increased
            after Edward Snowden last year leaked information that Internet
            companies are being compelled under court orders to give the
            U.S. National Security Agency information about citizens and
            other users. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. hasn't changed its policy and is reviewing
            the matter, according to Jodi Seth, a Facebook spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are committed to transparency, and providing notice
            about government requests is an important part of being
            transparent,' Seth wrote in an e-mailed statement. 'We are
            always working to improve our notification process as the law
            permits.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg earlier
            this year blasted President Barack Obama over how the government
            handles user data, saying it threatened the future of the
            Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google said it makes efforts to tell users about on legal
            requests. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;User Notification &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We notify users about legal demands when appropriate,
            unless prohibited by law or court order,' the company said in
            an statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In January, Google, Apple Inc. and other technology
            companies won U.S. permission to disclose more about government
            orders for customer data. Companies are permitted to say broadly
            how many accounts are covered by government requests and whether
            the content of users' communications was sought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Washington Post reported May 1 that the companies
            'updating their policies to expand routine notification of
            users about government data seizures.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, didn't respond to
            a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Takes On BlackBerry, Android in South Africa</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to find growth
            markets for its mobile products, is projecting that rising
            demand in South Africa will help it pass BlackBerry and Android
            and pave the way for further gains on the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company, working with hardware partners such as Nokia
            Oyj (NOK1V) and HTC Corp. (2498), plans to become South Africa's No. 1
            smartphone provider by 2016, Gustavo Fuchs, who runs its Windows
            Phone business in Africa and Middle East, said in an interview.
            The company plans models across a range of prices to lure users
            in the continent's biggest economy, where the average household
            income is about $13,500 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Africa will be the fastest-growing market by wireless
            subscribers over the next five years, according to consulting
            firm A.T. Kearney. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
            seeking areas of growth for its mobile business, which lags far
            behind Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc.'s Android that combined
            account for about 90 percent of the global smartphone market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'With a low-smartphone-penetration market, Windows Phone
            has a bigger chance to be the first smartphone for users,'
            Fuchs said in a phone interview from Johannesburg. 'The
            smartphone snowball effect has started.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Readies Windows Update as PC Sales Slump</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is preparing an update for Windows 8 as new licensing figures indicate the
            new operating system isn't fueling enough demand to reverse a slump in personal-computer sales. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 100 million Windows 8 licenses sold since the software's debut in October are in the 'general
            ballpark' with the previous version during a similar period, Tami Reller, chief financial officer of the
            Windows division, said in an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft completely overhauled its
            flagship operating system to make it more appealing to users amid a shift to mobile, touch-based computing.
            Still, Windows 8 has failed to reignite the ailing personal-computer market, where shipments plummeted by
            their largest margin on record in the latest quarter, according to market-research firm IDC. While Microsoft
            said it's planning to update Windows 8 to address customer feedback, updates won't quickly turn the PC
            industry around. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The changes will help some but there are some serious challenges that
            the PC industry is facing that I'm not sure can be easily fixed,' said Bob O'Donnell, an analyst at IDC who
            is based in San Mateo, California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O'Donnell also questioned whether the licensing
            milestone accurately reflects the number of operating systems in use. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer has attempted unsuccessfully to unravel a
            10-year search-advertising pact with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in favor of a deal with Google Inc. (GOOG),
            according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mayer began the effort to end the
            agreement soon after becoming Yahoo CEO in July, and she has met with resistance from Microsoft CEO Steve
            Ballmer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the meetings were private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's
            agreement to provide the technology for Yahoo Web searches hasn't met estimates, prompting Mayer to seek
            alternatives, the people said. The pact, which expires in 2020, was reached in 2009 by Ballmer and former
            Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a consolation for the poor performance of its search ads,
            Microsoft agreed to pay revenue guarantees to Yahoo through March 2014. That extends an arrangement between
            the companies that expired last month, Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo said in a regulatory filing
            yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mayer also has met with representatives of Google, her former employer, who
            have agreed verbally upon an alternate search-ad partnership should the arrangement with Microsoft end, one
            of the people said. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt said in October that the company would consider a search
            deal with Yahoo if the Web portal inquired. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company's application
            20140121539, published May 1in the database of the U.S. Patent

            &lt;p&gt;According to the application, the device can measure
            biometric parameters of the user with an optical sensor. The
            heart of the device is removable so that it can be recharged at
            a docking device and data can be downloaded. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft filed its application in October 2012. Sony

            Electronics Co. (005930) all have smartwatches, and Apple Inc. (AAPL), which has
            not yet produced one, has applied to register 'iWatch' as a

            &lt;p&gt;In a May 5 complaint, VBConversions LLC claims that the

            unauthorized use of its VB.NET to C# Converter software by one
            of PG's computer programmers. According to court papers,
            VBConversions used a tracking program to identify a PG
            unauthorized user who allegedly copied the program without

            PG's counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VBConversions, based in Santa Monica, California, asked the

        <headline>Barnes &amp;amp; Noble Surges on Report Microsoft Planning Nook Bid</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Barnes Noble Inc. (BKS) jumped the most in a year following a report that Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
            (MSFT) is planning to offer $1 billion to buy the Nook Media unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares surged 24
            percent to $22.08 at the close in New York for the largest one-day gain since April 30, 2012. It's also the
            bookseller's highest closing price since May 3, 2010. Microsoft fell 1 percent to $32.66. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            plan sees Microsoft gaining preferred units in Nook Media, which also includes a college book business,
            Techcrunch reported yesterday, citing internal documents. Nook Media also intends to discontinue its
            Android-based tablet business by the end of its 2014 fiscal year to begin using applications on unnamed
            'third-party' devices, Techcrunch said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for New
            York-based Barnes Noble, declined to comment on the report in an e-mail. A spokeswoman for Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April 2012, Microsoft announced a
            $300 million investment in the newly formed Nook Media subsidiary, and the shares surged 52 percent.
            Microsoft's 18 percent stake valued Nook Media at $1.7 billion. Publisher Pearson Plc (PSON) then announced
            an investment of $89.5 million in December in the unit, which gave Nook Media a valuation of $1.79 billion.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barnes Noble created Nook Media with an eye to separating it from the retail stores and
            website to boost its value. Investors have undervalued the company and dividing it up could alleviate that,
            Barnes Noble has said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Riggio Offer &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 25, Barnes Noble
            Chairman Leonard Riggio said he would offer to buy the company's 677 retail stores and website. Three days
            later, Barnes Noble reported that Nook sales in the fourth quarter sank 26 percent. Excess Nook devices
            forced the company to discount the tablets and writedown other inventory it couldn't sell. That led to a net
            loss in what is typically its most profitable period. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nook Media had an operating loss
            of $190.9 million and sales of $2.18 billion in the three quarters through Jan. 26. The division has been
            losing money as it spends on marketing and developing devices to compete in the tablet market with Apple
            Inc. (APPL), Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barnes Noble announced a partnership with
            Google on May 3 that will put Google Play, its online application and content store, and other applications
            such as Gmail on Nook tablets. Google's Nexus and Microsoft's Surface compete with each other as well
            against Nook. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft didn't have to sign off on the deal with Google, despite it
            owning 18 percent of Nook Media, Barnes Noble Chief Executive Officer William Lynch said in an interview on
            May 3. He said he didn't know what Microsoft thought about Barnes Noble partnering with one of the software
            maker's largest rivals. The bookseller is also using Google's brand in its marketing for Nook, including
            signs in its stores. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            with Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Sony Corp. (6758) to buy for $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At a trial that began today, U.S., Canadian and European
            creditors are fighting over how to divide cash raised through a
            series of auctions after what was once North America's largest
            telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European creditors, including British pensioners, said
            the Canadians are seeking 82 percent and the Americans are after
            73 percent of the $7 billion under their respective proposals.
            The division of the $4.5 billion raised in the patent sale has
            been a key sticking point. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The U.S.-Canada fight on the patents will be the main
            part of the trial,' Kevin Starke, a senior analyst with CRT
            Capital Group Inc. in Stamford, Connecticut, said in a phone
            interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian creditors, including Nortel's pension system,
            said that because the company was based in Ontario and owned the
            patents, it deserves the cash that was paid for them by the
            technology company group, according to Starke. Canada is seeking
            everything from the patent sale and 90 percent of all IP
            proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Licenses &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. creditors, including bondholders seeking full
            interest payments, said U.S. businesses held licenses for the
            patents, so they deserve the money. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Judges in Wilmington, Delaware, and Toronto are presiding
            over the video-linked proceeding. The tech companies that now
            own the patents said they fear valuable secrets may accidentally
            leak out during 25 days of testimony and argument and want the
            court to shield information concerning license agreements,
            potential litigation targets and other matters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nortel's U.S. unit contributed about $5.3 billion in assets
            to the bankruptcy sales, said Sheila R. Block, a lawyer for the
            U.S. estate speaking in Toronto. That unit also contributed
            about 70 percent of revenue from 2001 to 2009. As of 2001, every
            unit had a fully paid up license for the patents in their
            geographic region in perpetuity, said James L. Bromley, a lawyer
            for the U.S. unit in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Administrative Simplicity' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European group dismissed Canada's bid for sole right to
            the patent proceeds, saying the parent held legal ownership only
            for 'administrative simplicity,' according to Bill Maguire, a
            lawyer for the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The proper way to make distributions is based on each
            unit's financial contribution in creating the patents, Maguire
            said. Investments in research and development are used to
            establish economic ownership of the intellectual property, which
            is how Nortel calculated distributions when it sold assets to
            Alcatel-Lucent in 2006, according to Maguire. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You reap what you sow,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. creditors would get about 73 percent of the $7
            billion under their approach, with Canada getting about 11
            percent and Europe the rest, according to an exhibit presented
            by the European creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canada's model would give its creditors more than 82
            percent, while the U.S. and European creditors would get about
            14 percent and 4 percent, respectively. The European model would
            give U.S. creditors 50 percent, the Canadians about 32 percent
            and its own creditors the remainder. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1,000 Documents &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 1,000 documents may be used that Nortel's U.S.
            attorneys say potentially contain confidential information. As
            the papers are presented to witnesses, they might become public
            as part of the court record. And while other documents may be
            safe to disclose in public, the patent holders still want to be
            able to review them before they are introduced. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Canadian and U.S. creditors have said that without
            clear rules, the trial could be disrupted by the need to keep so
            many documents secret. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross has agreed to allow
            sensitive material to be blacked out. With so many documents
            involved, however, decisions on what to keep secret may have to
            be made while court is in session. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the joint venture that Microsoft, Apple and
            Sony formed to buy the patents in 2011, Rockstar Consortium
            Inc., will be following the trial along with Ericsson AB, which
            bought Nortel's wireless unit for $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Show Why &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gross said that on certain patent-related documents, he
            would defer to Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and the other
            companies about whether something should be kept secret. Anyone
            challenging the need to keep a document confidential would have
            to show why it should be made public, Gross said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nortel filed for bankruptcy after losing almost $7 billion
            since 2005. At its height in 2000, it reported $30 billion in
            annual revenue, had a market capitalization of $250 billion and
            employed almost 93,000 people, the company said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Today it's every debtor for itself making a territorial
            grab' for the sale proceeds, said Brian E. O'Connor, a lawyer
            representing about 36,000 U.K. pension claimants. 'While they
            fight like jackals over the decaying carcass,' the pensioners
            are being harmed, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-bk-10138, U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft to Offer Lower-Priced Xbox One Without Kinect</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a lower-priced option for its Xbox One, seeking to take back the
            lead in
            video-game console sales from Sony Corp. (6758) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new version, which will cost $399 and won't include the
            Kinect motion-sensing camera, will be available on June 9 in all
            markets where Xbox One is available, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move reverses a controversial decision by Microsoft to
            bundle Xbox One with Kinect, increasing the price of the console
            to $499, or $100 more than Sony's PlayStation 4. Although
            Microsoft had insisted it needed Kinect to convince game
            developers to write software for the motion sensor, Sony's big
            lead is prompting Microsoft to change its strategy. The
            PlayStation 4 outsold Xbox One consoles in the U.S. in March,
            holding the lead for a third month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The vision we have had for Xbox One continues, and that
            is that the premium experience is with Kinect,' Yusuf Mehdi,
            Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an
            interview. 'We did get a lot of customer feedback since launch
            from people saying 'I'd like more choices,' and for some people
            $399 is an important price point,' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also start giving users more access to
            entertainment applications such as YouTube, Netflix and HBO GO,
            changing another policy that annoyed customers. The company had
            required users to pay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription to use
            such apps. Starting in June, anyone with an Xbox One and Xbox
            360 can use those apps. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google to Microsoft Face User-Request Overload in Europe</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Deleting personal information online
            is costly and time-consuming for Web companies. Those
            difficulties are now set to be magnified in Europe for Google
            Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and others. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The European Union's top court yesterday ruled citizens
            have a 'right to be forgotten' online, meaning people may ask
            search-engine owners to remove personal information and request
            that a court or data-protection authority step in if a company
            doesn't comply. The EU decision doesn't spell out what types of
            information must be removed and doesn't provide exemptions for
            data that are true or from a reputable source. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;All of that is set to create new headaches for U.S. Web
            companies, which have businesses based on handling tremendous
            amounts of data that often aren't touched by humans. The ruling
            opens the way for European users to flood the firms with Web
            takedown requests, adding costs and time to what they already do
            in content removal. Many of the companies already deal with
            compliance for different data laws in various geographies,
            subjecting requests to shed content to thorough legal analyses
            before making the information unavailable. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's just such a mind-bogglingly impossible decision,'
            said Fred Cate, distinguished professor at the Indiana
            University Maurer School of Law. 'Courts aren't responsible for
            the practical implications of rulings but this really staggers
            the imagination.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Predicts Eurovision (Yup, you heard that right). The Winner Will Be Denmark</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;To win Eurovision, the annual pan-European song contest that launched the careers of Abba and
            Celine Dion, you've got to have style, a killer song and enough charm to convince judges from rival
            countries to vote for you. For the 2013 finals, aired across the region this weekend, the odds are on
            Denmark, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does a big tech company -- that's a big tech company
            that didn't invent iTunes, by the way (remember the Zune? Didn't think so) -- know about a kitschy European
            songfest? Microsoft Research economist David Rothschild has a project called PredictWise that sifts through
            zillions of data points scooped up from the Internet to predict outcomes of various public events like
            Eurovision, the Academy Awards, and elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PredictWise used its "big data" aggregation
            to correctly predict the U.S. Presidential election results for every state except Florida. And it got 19
            out of 24 categories correct in the 2013 Oscars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its Eurovision predictions take odds from
            gambling sites such as PaddyPower and Betfair, as well as Youtube views and mentions in social media,
            Rothschild says. Those, he said on his blog, are predictors of the votes of judges drawn from the dozens of
            countries competing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method works "particularly well for Eurovision, firstly, because
            the markets are extremely robust, and secondly, because the collective wisdom of the users includes the
            unique politics of the Eurovision voting blocs," Rothschild wrote on his blog. "This means that an American
            like me -- with detailed knowledge of markets, but little ' knowledge of Eurovision -- can make meaningful
            predictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His prediction, as of the time this blog was published: Denmark's Emmelie de
            Forest, singing "Only Teardrops," has a 50 percent chance of winning. Norway and Ukraine are next with 9.8
            percent and 8.4 percent odds respectively. The odds are sure to keep changing until Saturday, when some 125
            million viewers will tune in for the Eurovision finals in Malmo, Sweden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year,
            Sweden won in Baku, Azerbaijan, with "Euphoria" by Loreen, followed by a gang of Russian grandmothers called
            Buranovskiye Babushki, who got a standing ovation for the dance song, "Party for Everybody."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great
            Britain has just a 0.9 percent chance of finishing first, according to Rothschild's data. That won't sit
            well with Britons, who grumble that without a win since 1997 ("Love Shine a Light," by Katrina and the
            Waves), the contest must be rigged against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To end the drought, the country is
            putting forward Bonnie Tyler, a veteran Welsh hitmaker who topped the charts with "It's a Heartache," "Total
            Eclipse of the Heart" and "Holding Out for a Hero" in the '70s and '80s. She'll ask viewers -- and more
            important, judges -- to "believe in things that your eyes can't see" with her song "Believe in Me." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If
            they don't? Well, let's just say the Brits will always have the Beatles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Sony Beats Microsoft in Console Sales for Fourth Month</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. (6758)'s PlayStation 4 beat Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Xbox One to first place in U.S.
            console sales, extending its lead for a fourth month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'PlayStation 4 was the No. 1
            platform for hardware sales in April,' followed by Xbox One, Liam Callahan, an analyst at NPD Group Inc.,
            said in an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Customers continue to snap up the newest generation
            of consoles, according to Port Washington, New York-based NPD. The gain in hardware revenue in April boosted
            overall U.S. video-game sales even as software sales dropped. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will start
            selling a cheaper version of its Xbox One in June, shaving $100 off the $499 price to match Sony's
            PlayStation 4, as it tries to claw back the Tokyo-based company's lead. For the Sony, the success of the PS4
            is a bright spot for the company that forecast its sixth annual loss in seven years this week as it contends
            with slumping sales of TVs and PCs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. hardware sales in April rose 76 percent to
            $192.8 million from a year earlier, while software excluding titles for PCs fell 10 percent to $227.9
            million, as consumers held out for games for the new machines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold 115,000
            Xbox One machines in April, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a separate e-mail. Sony didn't
            release its monthly sales figure, saying in an e-mail only that it has sold 'over 7 million' PlayStation 4s
            worldwide, reiterating a statement last month. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Former Senator John Breaux said
            tennis taught him 'how to handle winning and losing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last night, Breaux, now senior counsel at Patton Boggs LLP,
            was honored for his contributions to the sport, along with
            former tennis ace Chris Evert, during the Geico Champions
            Celebration dinner at the residence of Swedish Ambassador Jonas Hafstrom. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hafstrom's wife, Eva, filled in as host as he was in his
            home country with Secretary of State John Kerry. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Breaux, who has been involved with a number of charity
            tournaments through the years, started playing the sport as a
            boy in Louisiana. He said his first court was asphalt with
            'cracks so big you could break your ankle.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;His game has progressed but remains modest compared to
            Evert's: 'She's won 18 Grand Slam Championships. I've won
            none.' Evert joked that his 'grip was a little dodgy.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dinner raised about $170,000 for the Junior Tennis
            Champions Center and its Game On program, which sends the
            center's players and coaches into inner-city schools. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other guests included Mark Ein, owner of the Washington
            Kastles tennis team and chief executive of Venturehouse Group

            &lt;p&gt;Matt Gelman, senior director of congressional affairs at
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), practiced his swing at last night's Home Runs
            for Horton's Kids at Nationals Park. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He was joined in the batting cage by congressional staff
            members, other lobbyists and their children. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This really is Washington at its best. Everybody
            leverages their contacts and pitches in,' said Ivan Zapien,
            vice president for federal relations at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) The
            event, now in its fifth year, helps the needy children of
            Washington's Ward 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Wal-Mart were among the grand slam sponsors,
            helping bring in more than $350,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Jeanne Wolak, senior director for legislative and
            regulatory strategy for Southern Co., wasn't too confident about
            her batting ability, but 'it's fun,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis, Wyoming Republican, was
            raring to get behind the plate, even in her red suit, after a

            chairman of Oceana Energy Co. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It seemed the appropriate thing to do as Nasr is the dean
            of the Paul Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at
            Johns Hopkins University. The younger Nitze and the school share
            the name of the late secretary of the Navy and acclaimed Cold

            deviled eggs, artichoke fritters and smoked bacon bites, and

        <headline>Google to Microsoft Face Rise in Removal Requests, Watchdog Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;France's privacy watchdog said more
            citizens are asking for help getting their personal information
            removed from search engines such as those run by Google Inc. (GOOG) and
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), less than a week after the European Union's top
            court ruled on a 'right to be forgotten' online. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;France's CNIL and Europe's other privacy watchdogs will
            discuss in a June meeting how they can enforce the ruling,
            President Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin said today in a conference.
            The EU's top court last week said citizens may ask search-engine
            owners to remove information and request that a court or data-protection authority step in if a company
            doesn't comply. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We've already received complaints citing the court
            decision,' Falque-Pierrotin said. 'The idea that companies
            like Google are too powerful to respect European rules -- we've
            proven that idea wrong. It's prompting citizen reactions.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While it's too early to say how the court ruling will be
            enforced, more users may ask CNIL to intervene, Falque-Pierrotin
            said. Complaints relating to the 'right to be forgotten' made
            up about a third of the requests received last year, she said.
            CNIL dealt with 5,640 complaints and 92,351 broader requests
            last year, according to its annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;CNIL has asked the French government to increase the
            maximum amount it can fine for privacy violations, which
            currently run from 150,000 euros ($206,000) to 300,000 euros for
            repeated offenses, Falque-Pierrotin said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the past year, Google has faced privacy problems in
            Germany and Italy. France's CNIL has been among the region's
            more vocal authorities in getting international Internet players
            to respect local and European privacy laws. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lead Role &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The French watchdog took the lead role for EU authorities
            debating measures directed at companies that violate privacy
            laws. It fined Google 150,000 euros in January for failing to
            give people enough details about how and why it uses their
            personal data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Privacy regulators want to play a bigger role beyond
            punitive intervention, she said. CNIL and other European
            regulators are in talks with Google on a possible accord over
            its privacy policy, with details to be announced 'before
            summer,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Updates Xbox as Apple to Facebook Gain in Games</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp (MSFT) (MSFT). is revamping the Xbox to fend off a breed of competitors ranging from
            Apple Inc (AAPL) (AAPL). to Facebook Inc. (FB) Those companies were nowhere in gaming when the software
            maker debuted its last version five years ago. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now these newcomers -- along with the
            likes of Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) -- are posing a threat by introducing their own
            software and devices that let consumers access an array of games and entertainment on smartphones, computers
            and home electronics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where once Microsoft's Xbox had only to contend with Sony Corp.
            (SNE)'s PlayStation and Nintendo Co.'s Wii, there's now a plethora of devices boasting robust graphics and
            computing power, capable of downloading games from the Internet and connecting TVs in the living room to
            gadgets throughout the house. That's putting pressure on Microsoft to make the new Xbox -- to be unveiled
            tomorrow at an event in Redmond, Washington -- capable of delivering more programming, entertainment and
            services, moving it further beyond the gaming realm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This has to last them in the
            living room for four to 10 years,' said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in San Francisco. 'They have
            to think about what's coming in five years and compete against the two generations of tablets which will
            come out during that time.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Said to Back Off Plans to Debut Smaller Surface</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), struggling to break
            into the tablet market, backed off plans to introduce a smaller
            version of its Surface tablet based on Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) processors,
            people with knowledge of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella and
            Executive Vice President Stephen Elop decided that the product
            in development wasn't different enough from rivals and probably
            wouldn't be a hit, said one of the people, who asked not to be
            identified because the plans weren't public. Engineers had been
            working on the device and had planned to unveil it as early as
            today at an event in New York, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead, the company removed any references to Surface
            devices based on Qualcomm's processors from the event and
            unveiled Surface Pro 3, an upgraded version of its pricier
            Windows-based tablet, which uses chips from Intel Corp. (INTC) and
            features a larger 12-inch screen. Microsoft is still working on
            smaller versions, Panos Panay, who runs the Surface business,
            said in an interview after the event. Panay declined to provide
            details on future products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Surface had just 1.3 percent share of the
            market in the first quarter, while smaller-size tablets
            accounted for 53 percent of sales in the period, according to
            researcher IDC. Nadella has said he wants to turn the Redmond,
            Washington-based company into one that focuses on 'mobile
            first, cloud first.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Unveils New Version of Surface Pro Tablet</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a larger-screen Surface tablet that is thinner and faster than
            the previous Surface Pro model, its latest attempt to gain share in the market dominated by Google Inc. and
            Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is the tablet that can replace your laptop,' Panos Panay, Surface vice
            president, said at an event in New York to unveil the new device. The product has a 12-inch screen, up from
            the previous version's 10.6 inches, and runs an Intel Corp. processor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Surface had
            1.3 percent of the tablet market in the first quarter, according to researcher IDC. The device hasn't made
            significant inroads in the 20 months since Microsoft introduced its first computer-hardware product, as
            consumers opt for Apple's iPad and tablets based on Google's Android software. Another challenge facing
            Microsoft is slowing growth in the touchscreen-device market, which IDC predicts will grow 19 percent this
            year, compared with 52 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'They need to clear up their messaging, they
            need to unify their apps so you can have the same apps run across multiple devices and form factors,' said
            Jitesh Ubrani, an analyst at Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. 'These are all things they are working on
            but not fast enough. There's also a certain level of beauty and polish on the iPad and the Surface isn't
            quite there yet.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google's Android, which powers tablets such as Samsung Electronics
            Co.'s Galaxy and Amazon.com Inc.'s Kindle Fire, ran 63 percent of the tablets sold in the first quarter,
            according to IDC. Apple's iOS had 33 percent share. Windows, which includes Surface and tablets from
            companies like Dell Inc., had 4.5 percent. Dell, Toshiba Corp. and others have already released smaller
            tablets running Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile, Cloud &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since taking the helm as
            chief executive officer in February, Satya Nadella has said he wants to turn the Redmond, Washington-based
            company into one that focuses on 'mobile first, cloud first.' His initial efforts have included rolling out
            its Office productivity software for Apple's (AAPL) iPad and updating Windows Phone mobile software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Fewer consumer purchases in developed markets are behind slowing growth in the tablet market,
            according to IDC. The slowdown is already being seen -- Apple said iPad sales fell 16 percent, the largest
            drop on record, in the quarter that ended in March. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Microsoft is counting on
            tablets and mobile computing for growth amid a persistent decline in the personal-computer market, where
            about 90 percent of machines run on the company's software. In April, IDC said first-quarter PC shipments
            fell 4.4 percent worldwide. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft still has room to gain ground in tablets, Ubrani
            said, though the company will need to connect with customers soon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's tough to say
            how many chances they will have,' he said. 'But they are certainly running out of time.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>VMware Public Cloud Software Challenges Amazon, Microsoft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;VMware Inc. (VMW) is debuting a service
            that lets customers use the Web to access information and
            programs stored in its data centers, an effort to challenge
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Early testers of the vCloud Hybrid Service include News
            Corp. (NWSA)'s Fox Broadcasting and the state of Michigan, VMware Chief
            Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger in an interview. The product
            will be more widely available in the third quarter, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VMware, the biggest provider of software that lets
            computers run multiple operating systems, is expanding in cloud-computing to bolster sales as U.S. customers
            trim technology
            spending. With the new product, VMware is entering the
            fastest-growing part of the cloud market, according to Gartner
            Inc., which estimates that sales of so-called infrastructure-as-a-service will surge by an average 38
            percent annually to
            $30.6 billion by 2017 from $6.17 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Customers are asking for it -- clearly the whole public
            cloud service area has been growing and maturing,' Gelsinger
            said. While he declined to provide pricing information, he said
            VMware's service will be more expensive than similar offerings
            from Amazon, the market leader, and Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gelsinger said VMware's new offering can command a premium
            because it lets users easily move applications between so-called
            private clouds, where software and services are run on customers'
            own machines, to public ones on VMware's servers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cloud Partners &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft rolled out an infrastructure-as-a-service product
            last month along with a pledge to match Amazon's prices on certain
            offerings. While 71 percent of public-cloud customers said they
            use Amazon in a Forrester Research Inc. (FORR) survey, about 20 percent
            said they used Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VMware will announce partnerships with Tibco Software Inc. (TIBX)
            as well as Pivotal -- a spinoff of VMware and its parent company
            EMC Corp. (EMC), according to Gelsinger. Those agreements will let
            customers run the applications they purchase from those
            companies in VMware's data centers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also allow vCloud Hybrid Service customers
            to use Microsoft's e-mail and database software running in the
            VMware cloud, Gelsinger said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;VMware is set to announce its new cloud product at an event
            today at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, California. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Unveils New Xbox in Bid to Lead Home Entertainment</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) (MSFT) unveiled its first new Xbox in almost eight years, seeking to
            position the console at the center of games and home entertainment against a growing roster of competitors
            that includes Apple Inc. (AAPL) (AAPL) to Facebook Inc. (FB) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The device is called Xbox
            One, Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment division, said today in Redmond,
            Washington, where he unveiled the product. The player, set to go on sale later this year, will use voice
            commands and motion sensing to recognize users and let them switch seamlessly between games, live TV and
            Skype video calling. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the top seller in U.S. consoles for more than two years,
            faces fresh competition from Sony Corp. (6758)'s PlayStation 4, also set for release near year-end, and
            Nintendo Co. (7974)'s Wii U, introduced last November. It must fend off Apple, Facebook (FB), Google Inc.
            (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), which all now offer an array of entertainment services, software and
            products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new machine marks the first time Microsoft 'has not introduced a console
            that is first and foremost about gaming,' said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. Exclusive
            content deals could help the company sell more players even as the traditional game audience fragments onto
            mobile devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To underscore the broader approach, Microsoft said it will
            produce a live-action TV show based on its best-selling 'Halo' alien shooting game. Director Steven
            Spielberg, famous for films such as the 'Indiana Jones' series and 'Jaws,' will have a role in the
            production, the company said, without providing details. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fantasy Football &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also struck a deal with the National Football League, letting the company develop
            applications like fantasy football games for use on the Xbox and mobile devices. The NFL will give players
            and coaches Microsoft products such as the Surface tablet for use on-field. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Team Xbox
            is on a new mission: design and build an all-in-one system to light up a new generation of games, TV and
            entertainment,' Mattrick said. 'It's the one system you're going to use and love every day, the place where
            your games and entertainment come alive.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company calls the new features
            'intelligent TV.' Prices won't be revealed today, according to David Dennis, a spokesman. Games from the
            current model, which sells for $180 at Amazon.com, won't work on the new Xbox, Dennis said. The company will
            allow trade-ins and resales of games for the new player. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kinect Included &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Kinect controller will be included with each Xbox, the company said, allowing Microsoft and
            developers to create products around the device's motion, voice and visual recognition capabilities. The
            Kinect will recognize users and show them a customized TV guide and a dashboard with the last five things
            they've done on the device. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kinect has been improved to operate better in low light, the
            company said. It uses a custom chip developed in Microsoft's Mountain View, California, office and employs
            technology the company calls 'time of flight' that works by tracking the speed of photons bouncing off the
            user to a sensor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new machine is black and horizontally oriented. It is eight to 10
            times more powerful than the Xbox 360 and will run on an 8-core system-on-a-chip processor from Advanced
            Micro Devices Inc (AMD). The Xbox One will include 8 gigabytes of random access memory and a Blu-ray disc
            player, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 0.7 percent to $34.85 at the close in New York.
            The stock has risen 30 percent this year, compared with a 17 percent gain for the Standard Poor's 500 Index.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mobile Market &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shifts in the market, especially in mobile, are
            pressuring Microsoft to make the new Xbox capable of delivering more entertainment and services, moving
            further from video games. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;U.S. retail sales of packaged video games fell 21 percent last
            year to $8.9 billion, according to researcher NPD Group, while revenue from games downloaded to computers
            and mobile devices rose 16 percent to $5.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This has to last them in the living
            room for four to 10 years,' said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in San Francisco. 'They have to
            think about what's coming in five years and compete against the two generations of tablets which will come
            out during that time.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Activision Blizzard Inc. (ATVI), the largest U.S. game producer,
            provided a first look at 'Call of Duty: Ghosts,' the next version of its top-selling game franchise.
            Downloadable content for the game will be available on Xbox first. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fresh Titles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also announced a strategic partnership with Electronic Arts Inc. (EA), the second-largest
            U.S. video-game maker. The Redwood City, California-based game publisher will supply exclusive content from
            its soccer, football, basketball and fighting titles next year, Andrew Wilson, executive vice president of
            EA Sports, said at the briefing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to offer 15 exclusive games in
            the first year, including eight completely new titles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Xbox is one of Microsoft's
            better-performing businesses. Sales in the entertainment and devices unit, including Xbox, rose 56 percent
            in the quarter that ended March 31. Operating income totaled $342 million, compared with a loss a year
            earlier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fiscal 2012, the entertainment unit saw sales increase 7.6 percent, while
            revenue in Microsoft's Windows division dropped 3.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Industry leadership is no
            guarantee of future success. In November 2005, when Microsoft took the wraps off the Xbox 360, Sony led in
            console sales, only to came up short with the PlayStation 3 after Nintendo's Wii upended the market with a
            motion-activated controller. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;U.S. Sales &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nintendo has sold 41.2
            million of its first-generation Wii players in the U.S., compared with 39 million Xbox 360 consoles and 24.2
            million Sony PlayStation 3s, according to NPD Group Inc., the Port Washington, New York-based researcher.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time Xbox comes in with 28 months of market-leading sales in the U.S., according to
            NPD, outgunning Sony and the Wii-U, which is selling below Nintendo's projections. Microsoft has sold 76
            million Xbox 360 consoles worldwide and has 46 million subscribers to the Xbox Live online service. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Worldwide the video game industry generated hardware and software sales of $37.4 billion last year,
            according to Gartner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Works With China After Windows 8 Exclusion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest
            software maker, said it's working with China's government to
            evaluate its Windows 8 operating system after the software was
            excluded from a government purchasing order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which continues to provide Windows 7 to
            government customers, was 'surprised' to learn Windows 8 was
            shut out of China's purchase of energy-efficient computers,
            Joanna Li, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Microsoft, said in an
            e-mailed response to questions. The company learned of the
            decision in a notice from the China Central Government
            Procurement Center yesterday, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The notice from the procurement center gave no reason for
            excluding Windows 8, yet China's official Xinhua News Agency
            yesterday reported it was 'a move to ensure computer security'
            after the company ended support for Windows XP. Microsoft
            stopped support for XP, which has a 70 percent market share in
            China, on April 8, Xinhua reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft has been working proactively with the Central
            Government Procurement Center and other government agencies
            through the evaluation process to ensure that our products and
            services meet all government procurement requirements,' Li
            said. 'At the same time we are working on the Windows 8
            evaluation with relevant government agencies.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason for the exclusion order is concerns over
            Internet safety, Xinhua reported, without citing anyone. The
            news agency said that China must be careful after reports of
            U.S. spying. Microsoft and other software makers have been
            contending with customer concerns following leaks about the U.S.
            National Security Agency's data-collection programs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Hacker Threat &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Windows XP users in China are concerned about the threat
            from hacker attacks following the end of Microsoft support for
            the XP system, Xinhua reported. China's Ministry of Industry and
            Information Technology said last month the end of Windows XP
            support brought risks to the nation's communications networks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has encouraged XP users to upgrade to Windows 7
            and Windows 8. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China's decision to exclude Windows 8 was announced in a
            statement dated May 16. Procurements are often not immediately
            posted online. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), the world's largest maker of personal
            computers, will see no impact from China excluding Microsoft's
            Windows 8 from government procurement as the company has other
            software options for customers, Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing said on a conference call today.
            Lenovo, which has its
            headquarters in Beijing and Morrisville, North Carolina, has no
            plan to make its own operating system, Yang said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. indicted five Chinese military officials for
            allegedly hacking into the computer networks of U.S. companies
            to steal trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Following the indictments, China's Defense Ministry accused
            the U.S. of 'hypocrisy and double standards on the issue of
            network security.' China also suspended its involvement in a
            cybersecurity working group with the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft to Add Several Thousand Workers in China, Ballmer Says</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest software
            maker, will hire several thousand workers in China to support
            new cloud computing services and smartphones using its Windows
            operating system, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The workforce expansion, from a current base of 4,000
            staff, will take place during the next year, Ballmer said
            yesterday at a press conference in Shanghai that was streamed
            live on the Internet. He didn't provide a specific number for
            new workers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;China has become the fastest growing market for the
            company's smartphone operating system, Ballmer said. The
            Redmond, Washington-based company will start a public preview of
            its Windows Azure service in the country next month, making
            Microsoft the first multinational to offer public cloud
            computing in the nation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I visited China last about one year ago in May and it is
            remarkable to me how much has changed,' Ballmer, 57, said. 'At
            Microsoft this is an incredibly exciting time.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is counting on Azure and Internet-based business
            programs to bolster growth as a global personal-computer slump
            erodes demand for its software installed on desktop machines.
            Shipments of PCs dropped 13.9 percent in the first three months
            of this year, the steepest quarterly decline ever, International
            Data Corp. reported last month. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft's Xbox Not Blocked From Import in Google Loss</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Xbox video-gaming
            system won't be blocked from entering the U.S. after a trade
            panel found it doesn't infringe a patent owned by Google Inc. (GOOG)'s
            Motorola Mobility unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. International Trade Commission yesterday in
            Washington found the Xbox doesn't infringe Motorola's patent for
            a way to establish communication between the gaming-system and
            accessories, such as the controllers, ending a case filed in
            November 2010. The agency upheld a March ruling that cleared the
            Xbox, which is made in China, of the infringement claim. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is part of a global dispute between the companies
            over who is using whose patented inventions. Microsoft wants
            Motorola Mobility to pay royalties on smartphones running on
            Google's Android operating system. Google claims Microsoft owes
            Motorola Mobility royalties on the Xbox and Windows operating
            system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has argued that,
            even if it violates the Motorola patent, banning the Xbox would
            be an extreme remedy that would reduce consumer choice and hurt
            game developers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a win for Xbox customers and confirms our view
            that Google had no grounds to block our products,' Microsoft
            Deputy General Counsel David Howard said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Matt Kallman, a spokesman for Google, said the company was
            disappointed and evaluating its next steps. The case can be
            appealed to a court that specializes in patent law. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Top Seller &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Xbox has been the top-selling U.S. game console for
            more than two years. Microsoft's entertainment unit, which
            includes the Xbox, generated $9.6 billion in sales last year, or
            13 percent of the company's revenue, according to data compiled
            by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft unveiled a new version, called Xbox One, earlier
            this week that employs voice commands and motion sensing to
            recognize users and let them switch seamlessly between games,
            live television and Skype video calling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The system is scheduled to go on sale later this year as
            part of Microsoft's strategy to fend off competition from Sony
            Corp. (6758)'s PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Co.'s Wii U, as well as new
            devices from Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft won a trade commission case last year limiting
            Motorola Mobility's ability to include on its phones a feature
            called ActiveSync, which lets users coordinate schedules between
            their phones and personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Patent Disputes &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, and Microsoft
            also have patent disputes in Germany and Seattle. Microsoft and
            Apple have also filed complaints in the U.S. and Europe accusing
            Motorola Mobility of demanding unfair royalty rates for some
            patents that relate to widely used technology like Wi-Fi
            connections or video transmission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other patents that originally were part of the Xbox case
            fell into that category. Two patents that were part of the
            original complaint were on standard technology for video
            decoding, and led to accusations by Microsoft and regulators
            that Motorola Mobility was misusing patents to thwart
            competition. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility dropped those two after Google reached an
            agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over the use of
            standard-essential patents. Two other patents were dropped
            because they are expiring this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement with the FTC also covered a review of the
            company's search business. Google is facing a new antitrust
            probe by the FTC into whether the company is using its
            leadership in the online display-advertising market to illegally
            curb competition, people familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Gaming and Entertainment
            Consoles, Related Software and Components Thereof, 337-752, U.S.
            International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) sued rival mobile-phone
            maker HTC Corp. for selling products in the U.S., including the
            HTC One handset, that allegedly infringe three of its patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patents pertain to 'terminal, method and computer
            program product for interacting with a signaling tag,'
            according to the complaint Nokia filed May 23 in federal court
            in San Diego. The Espoo, Finland-based company seeks a court
            order halting the alleged infringement and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia, which lost its 14-year title as world's biggest
            seller of mobile phones to Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. in
            2011, is trying to expand revenue from its patent portfolio. The
            company last year sued Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC in the U.S. and
            in Germany over alleged patent infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Upon receiving the official document, HTC is to consider
            all legal options to protect our rights,' the Taiwanese company
            said in an e-mailed statement May 23. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 7,775,432, 8,306,065, and 8,366,000. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Nokia Oyj v. HTC Corp. (2498), 13-1231, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of California (San Diego). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Actavis Sale of Generic Pulmicort Blocked by Appeals Court &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Actavis Inc. (ACT)'s sales of a generic form of AstraZeneca PLC (AZN)'s
            Pulmicort pediatric asthma treatment were cut short after a May
            24 order from a federal appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sales were to have begun April 1, following a trial court
            ruling that Parsippany, New Jersey-based Actavis didn't infringe
            AstraZeneca's patent 7,524,834, and that a second patent at
            issue -- 6,598,603 -- wasn't valid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trial court issued a temporary ban on sale of the
            generic version of the drug on April 2, to give AstraZeneca a
            chance to go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
            Circuit, a Washington-based court that hears appeals of patent
            cases. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The appeals court issued its temporary order May 24, saying
            that London-based AstraZeneca had established it was entitled to
            that protection during the course of the appeal. AstraZeneca is
            required to post a $72 million bond within 7 days of the ruling,
            according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the appeals court granted a request from
            Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. to file a friend
            of the court brief. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is AstraZeneca LP v. Breath Ltd., 2013-1312-1352,
            U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The lower court
            case is AstraZeneca LP v. Breath Ltd., 1:08-cv-01512-RMB-AMD,
            U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;TopShop Ltd., the London-based clothing retailer, was sued
            by pop singer Rihanna, who claims the chain sold T-shirts
            without authorization that bear her image, the U.K.'s Telegraph
            newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;She had been in negotiations with the chain for more than a
            year over the shirts, according to the Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The newspaper reported that Rihanna is seeking $5 million
            in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Although TopShop has some U.S. outlets, the allegedly
            infringing product wasn't sold there, according to the
            Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Copyright Infringement Claim Rejected by Russian Court &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s copyright infringement complaint against
            the joint German-Russian venture Autobahn was rejected by the
            Moscow Region Commercial Court, the Russian Legal Information
            Agency reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the world's largest
            software company, claimed unauthorized copies of its software
            were found on Autobahn computers during an inspection by Russian
            law enforcement officials, according to RAPSI. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court found fault with the protocol under which the
            inspection was conducted and said that Microsoft didn't provide
            adequate evidence to defeat Autobahn's claims that the
            inspection didn't take place at the address specified in court
            documents, RAPSI reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Autobahn, founded in 1995, is a joint venture between a
            group of Russian road construction companies and Windhagen,
            Germany's Wirtgen GmbH, according to the news agency. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Chinese Researches at NYU Arrested, Charged in Espionage Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Three Chinese researchers at New York University were
            charged with falsification of records and commercial bribery in
            an industrial espionage case. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The scientists are accused of providing information to a
            Chinese medical-imaging company that flows from their research
            at the university funded by grants from the National Institutes
            of Health, according to the complaint filed May 19 in federal
            court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government alleged in court papers that Yudong Zhu, an
            associate professor in radiology at NYU, provided false
            statements regarding his affiliation with a Chinese government-sponsored research institution, a Chinese
            medical-imaging
            company, and about his application for and ownership of a patent
            related to NIH-funded research. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zhu's patent 8,319,495 B1 was issued in November 2012, and,
            according to the complaint, the university became aware of it
            only in connection with its own investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Additional allegations are related to photographs taken of
            lab equipment, and e-mails to the Chinese company. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Zhu is represented by Robert M. Baum of Federal Defenders
            of New York Inc., who didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed
            request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. A v. ZHU, 11:13-mj-01309-UA, U.S. District
            Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sheppard Mullin Richter Hampton LLP hired Scott J. Palmer
            for its IP practice group, the Los Angeles-based firm said in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Nadella Touts New Opportunities to Lead</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
            Officer Satya Nadella said he will seek to focus on businesses
            where the company can lead, rather than harp on missed
            opportunities in areas like tablet computers and hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The question is, what is the next thing that is going to
            make us better?' Nadella said in a keynote interview yesterday
            at Re/code's Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
            'It's the hunt for what is it that is the inflection point that
            matters more than what caused us to miss.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Nadella's first public interview since replacing Steve Ballmer as CEO in February, he also said
            he doesn't plan to
            change Microsoft's plans for Xbox or sell off the Bing search
            engine. The company will continue to span both enterprise and
            consumer markets, he said. He highlighted Microsoft's focus on
            products that run on any device, as well as the areas of Web-based cloud computing, mobile and business
            software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As part of that effort, the Redmond, Washington-based
            company also used the conference to unveil a new Skype product
            that translates Web-conference conversations in real time. Set
            for a test release later this year, the Skype translator was
            demonstrated in a conversation between Gurdeep Singh Pall, who
            oversees Skype, and a German speaker. The product provides both
            a spoken and text translation and will initially be available as
            a stand-alone offering before being combined into the Skype
            application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;'Global Product' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Skype is a very global product -- it's all about
            connecting people that are separated by distance,' Pall said in
            an interview. 'One of the biggest barriers that still remains
            is really the language barrier.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't sure how many languages will be included
            initially, Pall said. The company will release new languages as
            they meet the bar for translation quality. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The software relies on work by Microsoft's research arm, as
            well as the Bing search unit, which has its own translation
            product for Web pages and Internet content, he said. The Skype
            service needs to use speech recognition to understand the
            speaker, machine learning for the translation, and text-to-speech technology to send the translation to the
            listener. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since taking over, Nadella has sought to focus the world's
            largest software maker on mobile and cloud products. He has
            signaled a desire to shift attention to producing software for
            rival operating systems like Apple Inc.'s iOS and Google Inc.'s
            Android and has shuffled management in areas like marketing,
            business development and the Xbox game console. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Tablet Event &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A company event earlier this month to release a new Surface
            tablet was noteworthy for what the CEO chose not to unveil.
            While Microsoft showed a larger model of its Surface Pro, a
            planned smaller tablet failed to meet with the approval of
            Nadella and his executives and was pulled from the event, people
            familiar with the matter said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At the session in New York, Nadella didn't discuss the
            missing device and noted that Microsoft won't seek to develop
            hardware to compete with its partners and will instead focus on
            areas where it can develop something unique. His comments
            suggest a more selective approach to building devices rather
            than going for the largest number of offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In Nadella's first quarter as CEO, Microsoft posted better-than-projected profit as cloud
            initiatives and cost controls
            begun under Ballmer boosted results. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest
            software company, is seeking a patent on a technology that
            rewards viewers for watching commercials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Application 20130125161, published in the database of the
            U.S. Patent and Trademark Office May 16, covers a method of
            increasing interactive viewing by tying achievement to specific
            content. Viewers who meet certain set goals will receive an
            award, which may be physical or virtual, according to the
            application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In some situations, the award may be tied to an avatar,
            Microsoft said. Such awards could include the avatar itself, new
            vehicles for the avatar, new homes for the avatar, virtual money
            to purchase different avatar items, including clothes for the
            avatar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft applied for this patent
            in November 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Louboutin Sues California Company Over Knockoff Red Shoe Soles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Christian Louboutin Sarl, the Paris-based maker of shoes
            that sell for as much as $6,400 per pair, sued a California shoe
            distributor for trademark infringement and is seeking more than
            $2 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alba Footwear LLC of City of Industry, California, is
            accused of importing shoes that infringe Louboutin's red-sole
            trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigators for Louboutin have bought Alba-supplied shoes
            that featured red soles, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The French shoe company asked the federal court in
            Manhattan to order Alba and its co-defendants' to halt their
            acts of infringement. Additionally, Louboutin is seeking an
            order for the recall and destruction of infringing products and
            promotional materials and for awards of money damages, attorney
            fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alba didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
            comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Christian Louboutin SAS v. Alba Footwear LLC,
            1:13-cv-03536-PAC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
            York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Maasai Tribe May Seek Trademark Protection for Name, Images &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Africa's Maasai tribe may consider seeking protection for
            its intellectual property by registering trademarks, the BBC
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Light Years IP, a Washington-based non-profit that works on
            IP issues with producers in developing countries, told the BBC
            that if the Maasai brand were owned by a corporation, it might
            be worth more than $10 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 80 companies worldwide use either the Maasai name or
            an image of the tribe, including LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
            Vuitton SA (MC), which uses it for a line of beach towels, hats,
            scarves and duffle bags, and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc's
            Land Rover unit, which uses the term for a series of accessories
            for its vehicles, the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Arbitron Sues Saga for Unauthorized Use of Audience Rating Data &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arbitron Inc. (ARB), the media and marketing research firm, sued
            Saga Communications Inc. for allegedly making unauthorized use
            of Arbitron's audience estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saga, based in Gross Pointe Farms, Michigan, is accused of
            using the audience estimates without permission, beginning in
            September 2010, according to the complaint filed May 23 in
            federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. Saga owns and operates
            radio and television stations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arbitron, of Columbia, Maryland, accuses Saga of using the
            data for a variety of purposes, including setting advertising
            rates for its radio stations, and making programming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These ratings were also factored into a formula used to
            determine employee compensation, Arbitron said. This was such a
            common practice, Arbitron claims, that employees' bonuses were
            known as 'Arbitron bonuses,' based on how well a particular
            radio program fared in Arbitron audience estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arbitron is asking the court for awards of damages of at
            least $150,000 per act of infringement, in addition to attorney
            fees and litigation costs. The company also asked for extra
            damages aimed at punishing Saga for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saga didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
            comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Arbitron Inc., v. Saga Communications Inc. (SGA),
            1:13-cv-00923-UNA, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
            (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Taiwan's Music Industry Seeks Blockage of Infringing Websites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taiwan's Recording Industry Foundation, a music-industry
            trade group, is calling for amendments to that nation's
            copyright laws, the Taipei Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The industry favors legislation enabling the blocking of
            foreign websites that infringe, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taiwan's Intellectual Property Office said it will ask
            Internet services providers to block access to domain names and
            Internet protocol addresses that infringe, the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cheng Kuo-wei, who heads the Association of Digital Culture
            Taiwan's Department of Media and International Cooperation
            cautioned that what he deemed excessive expansion of IP rights
            could obstruct chill the development of culture-oriented
            business, according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Lionsgate Entertainment Accused of Anticompetitive Use of IP &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lionsgate Entertainment Corp. and its Summit Entertainment
            unit were accused of using their copyright policy in an anti-competitive fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Los Angeles-based Between the Lines Productions LLC,
            creator of 'Twiharder,' a feature-length parody of Summit's
            'Twilight' series of films, accused Lionsgate of 'ridiculous-to-insane overreaches of intellectual property
            law.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed yesterday in federal court in
            Manhattan, Between the Lines said that Summit's copyright-enforcement actions have been conducted 'by a high
            degree of
            disregard for this nation's copyright and trademark law.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lionsgate and Summit are accused of seeking to monopolize
            the conversation in adjacent markets in which speech content is
            used to comment on or criticize the 'Twilight' films. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Between the Lines said its film was marketed 'with
            complete transparency' as a parody, and it used none of the
            actual content of Summit's 'Twilight' products. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The maker of the parody film says after it received a
            cease-and-desist notice from Lionsgate, distributors revoked
            their offers to do business with Between the Lines, effectively
            excluding it from the market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It asked the court for a declaration that its 'Twiharder'
            film doesn't infringe Lionsgate's copyrights and awards of $500
            million in damages. It also requested that some of the profit
            from the Twilight films to be placed in a public trust 'to fund
            an expedient and legitimate effort to re-codify' copyright
            law's 'fair use' provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company also asked the court to cancel some of the
            Twilight-related trademark registrations and to declare sections
            of U.S. copyright law dealing with parodies as overboard. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lionsgate didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request
            for comment on the lawsuit. The Santa Monica, California-based
            company acquired Summit in January 2012 for $412.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the complaint, Between the Lines claims that the five
            'Twilight' films grossed $4.34 billion in worldwide theatrical
            release. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Between the Lines Productions LLC v. Lionsgate
            Entertainment Corp., 1:13-cv-02584, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;U.K. Court Approves Extradition in Industrial Spying Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A U.K. court ordered extradition of an Indian citizen
            accused of industrial espionage under India's Official Secrets
            Act, the Times of India reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ravi Shankaran, who was accused of leaking confidential
            military information to arms dealers, has argued that the
            evidence against him was fabricated and that the lengthy delays
            in the Indian judicial system would violate his human rights,
            according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Shankaran said they will appeal the extradition
            ruling from the Westminster's Magistrate Court in London, the
            Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's Central Bureau of Investigation, which began
            investigating the case in 2006, sent a two-member team to London
            to assist authorities at the extradition trial, according to the
            Times. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft-Skype Merger Approval Was Careless, Cisco Tells Court</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) challenged
            European Union regulators' approval of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s 2011
            takeover of Skype Technologies SA, telling judges the deal
            created so many competition concerns there should have been an
            in-depth probe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft should never have been allowed to 'buy its way
            to monopoly' in the market for communications that combine
            instant messaging, voice and video calls, Cisco told the EU
            General Court in Luxembourg today. Cisco wants the court to rule
            whether the EU was able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
            that the merger didn't trigger competition problems, without an
            in-depth examination. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This was a very serious case and there were many factors
            to show that there could be serious harm for consumers,'
            Alfonso Lamadrid, a lawyer for Cisco told the court today. 'The
            commission brushed off these concerns. Its assessment was, with
            all due respect, careless.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft won unconditional approval from the EU in October
            2011 to buy Skype, the world's most popular international
            calling service, for $8.5 billion. EU regulators said the deal
            wouldn't harm competition because the market was growing and
            they faced 'numerous players, including Google.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The commission used 'flawed reasoning' that conflicted
            with its approach in previous cases, said Cisco, the largest
            maker of computer-networking equipment. The combination of the
            companies would give them a combined market share of 80 percent
            to 90 percent in the market for video calls on Microsoft's
            Windows-based computers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Eliminate Incentive &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It would 'reinforce' the new company's dominant position
            and 'eliminate any incentive' to offer interoperability with
            other products, Cisco said, according to a court summary of the
            San Jose, California based company's written arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The market share hasn't 'put off' other participants,
            such as Viber Media Inc., from entering the market, said
            Nicholas Khan, a lawyer for the commission. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Cisco pretends to seek interoperability, but what it
            actually seeks is that it wants Microsoft to change its
            products,' Georg Berrisch, a lawyer for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, told the three-judge panel.
            Microsoft bought
            Skype 'to expand its offerings on the consumer market.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Luis Ortiz Blanco, another lawyer for Cisco, said the EU
            failed to show that users will be able to easily switch from one
            platform to another. The commission failed to understand that
            people communicate in interconnected groups and as such would be
            less willing to switch. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If you can already reach everybody on Skype, why should
            you switch to different applications,' said Ortiz Blanco. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is: T-79/12, Cisco Systems and Messagenet v.
            Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft, Louboutin, Maasai, Arbitron: Intellectual Property</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest
            software company, is seeking a patent on a technology that
            rewards viewers for watching commercials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Application 20130125161, published in the database of the
            U.S. Patent and Trademark Office May 16, covers a method of
            increasing interactive viewing by tying achievement to specific
            content. Viewers who meet certain set goals will receive an
            award, which may be physical or virtual, according to the
            application. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In some situations, the award may be tied to an avatar,
            Microsoft said. Such awards could include the avatar itself, new
            vehicles for the avatar, new homes for the avatar, virtual money
            to purchase different avatar items, including clothes for the
            avatar. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft applied for this patent
            in November 2011. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Louboutin Sues California Company Over Knockoff Red Shoe Soles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Christian Louboutin Sarl, the Paris-based maker of shoes
            that sell for as much as $6,400 per pair, sued a California shoe
            distributor for trademark infringement and is seeking more than
            $2 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alba Footwear LLC of City of Industry, California, is
            accused of importing shoes that infringe Louboutin's red-sole
            trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Investigators for Louboutin have bought Alba-supplied shoes
            that featured red soles, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The French shoe company asked the federal court in
            Manhattan to order Alba and its co-defendants' to halt their
            acts of infringement. Additionally, Louboutin is seeking an
            order for the recall and destruction of infringing products and
            promotional materials and for awards of money damages, attorney
            fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Alba didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
            comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Christian Louboutin SAS v. Alba Footwear LLC,
            1:13-cv-03536-PAC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
            York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Maasai Tribe May Seek Trademark Protection for Name, Images &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Africa's Maasai tribe may consider seeking protection for
            its intellectual property by registering trademarks, the BBC
            reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Light Years IP, a Washington-based non-profit that works on
            IP issues with producers in developing countries, told the BBC
            that if the Maasai brand were owned by a corporation, it might
            be worth more than $10 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;About 80 companies worldwide use either the Maasai name or
            an image of the tribe, including LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
            Vuitton SA (MC), which uses it for a line of beach towels, hats,
            scarves and duffle bags, and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc's
            Land Rover unit, which uses the term for a series of accessories
            for its vehicles, the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Arbitron Sues Saga for Unauthorized Use of Audience Rating Data &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arbitron Inc., the media and marketing research firm, sued
            Saga Communications Inc. (SGA) for allegedly making unauthorized use
            of Arbitron's audience estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saga, based in Gross Pointe Farms, Michigan, is accused of
            using the audience estimates without permission, beginning in
            September 2010, according to the complaint filed May 23 in
            federal court in Wilmington, Delaware. Saga owns and operates
            radio and television stations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arbitron, of Columbia, Maryland, accuses Saga of using the
            data for a variety of purposes, including setting advertising
            rates for its radio stations, and making programming decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These ratings were also factored into a formula used to
            determine employee compensation, Arbitron said. This was such a
            common practice, Arbitron claims, that employees' bonuses were
            known as 'Arbitron bonuses,' based on how well a particular
            radio program fared in Arbitron audience estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Arbitron is asking the court for awards of damages of at
            least $150,000 per act of infringement, in addition to attorney
            fees and litigation costs. The company also asked for extra
            damages aimed at punishing Saga for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Saga didn't respond immediately to an e-mailed request for
            comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Arbitron Inc. (ARB), v. Saga Communications Inc.,
            1:13-cv-00923-UNA, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
            (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Taiwan's Music Industry Seeks Blockage of Infringing Websites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taiwan's Recording Industry Foundation, a music-industry
            trade group, is calling for amendments to that nation's
            copyright laws, the Taipei Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The industry favors legislation enabling the blocking of
            foreign websites that infringe, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Taiwan's Intellectual Property Office said it will ask
            Internet services providers to block access to domain names and
            Internet protocol addresses that infringe, the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cheng Kuo-wei, who heads the Association of Digital Culture
            Taiwan's Department of Media and International Cooperation
            cautioned that what he deemed excessive expansion of IP rights
            could obstruct chill the development of culture-oriented
            business, according to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;U.K. Court Approves Extradition in Industrial Spying Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A U.K. court ordered extradition of an Indian citizen
            accused of industrial espionage under India's Official Secrets
            Act, the Times of India reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ravi Shankaran, who was accused of leaking confidential
            military information to arms dealers, has argued that the
            evidence against him was fabricated and that the lengthy delays
            in the Indian judicial system would violate his human rights,
            according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Shankaran said they will appeal the extradition
            ruling from the Westminster's Magistrate Court in London, the
            Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;India's Central Bureau of Investigation, which began
            investigating the case in 2006, sent a two-member team to London
            to assist authorities at the extradition trial, according to the
            Times. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Xbox One TV Focus Has Core Gamers Seeking More</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) crammed the new Xbox One with something for everybody. One constituency says
            it got short shrift: the die-hard players who tend to spend most on high-end action-packed titles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That's stepping up pressure on Microsoft, now preparing for E3, the gaming industry's annual
            conference in Los Angeles, to introduce a lineup better suited for the gamers who help fuel the $67 billion
            video-game market. Facing new competition from Apple Inc. (AAPL), Google Inc. (GOOG) and Amazon.com Inc.
            (AMZN) for consumers' time in the living room, Microsoft will also have to deliver titles that can contend
            with new software and consoles from longtime rivals Sony Corp. (6758) and Nintendo Co. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It
            is critical for Xbox One to attract hard-core gamers,' said Liam Callahan, an analyst at NPD Group Inc.
            based in Port Washington, New York. 'While Microsoft clearly focused on what Xbox One can do outside of
            gaming, they are using E3 to speak to the hard-core audience.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the first
            Xbox event held at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters was focused on the machine's broad entertainment
            capabilities, including personalized programming recommendations for families and a fantasy-football
            application for gridiron fans. The bulk of new games will debut at E3, which runs from June 11 to 13,
            Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It will be clear on June 10 that Xbox One is going to be the home to
            the biggest and best games of the current and next-generation platforms,' Letty Cherry, a spokeswoman for
            Microsoft, said in an e-mailed statement. Game companies usually unveil their top offerings ahead of the
            annual expo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Serious Machine &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stuart Bridson, a resident of
            Manchester, U.K., who owns an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3, is just the kind of audience Microsoft needs to
            wow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'll be watching E3 intently, as Microsoft needs to quell the public pressure by
            demonstrating some actual games,' Bridson said. 'Above all else, they need to show some games to show that
            the One is a serious gaming machine, and not just a multimedia device which happens to play games.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sony focused more on games at a February event to unveil the PlayStation 4. While the machine's
            specifications and features appealed to game developers and hard-core gamers, it also left Sony open to some
            criticism that the company wasn't pushing far enough in the wider entertainment space, according to Brian
            Blau, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither Sony nor Microsoft have
            announced prices for their new consoles. The current Xbox sells for $200 to $300. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Entertainment
            Hub &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's good reason for Microsoft and its peers to broaden the appeal of their
            consoles, targeting families and the consumer-entertainment market. Sales of packaged games are declining in
            the U.S., and there's growing competition from casual games played on the Web and on mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;At an event May 21, Microsoft showed how Xbox One can control live television, allow users to view
            programs and rapidly switch applications, games and shows using voice commands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            machine's Kinect sensor recognizes users and loads recommendations and the last five things they were doing.
            Users can see what shows and games are popular and what their friends are doing. Xbox One includes a
            custom-built eight-core processor by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD), with 8 gigabytes of memory to speed
            up functions, and a combined graphic chip. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xbox One reflects a focus on building the
            best machine for gaming, Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft's interactive entertainment business, said in
            an interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'We thought, 'OK, clean sheet of paper, new architecture, what are you
            going to design?'' he said. 'We want to make the best hard-core gaming box, great, how do you do that?' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Independent Developers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of hard-core gamers is about 10 million,
            according to Peter Molyneux, a veteran game developer who worked for Microsoft after the software company
            purchased his Lionhead Studios. That's eclipsed by hundreds of millions of people playing games on mobile
            devices, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft needs to show that beyond sequel titles and its own new
            games, it can woo independent developers to deliver games that appeal to a wide audience, said Kevin Wong, a
            gamer in his second year at the University of Southern California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'A lot of the
            movement in the industry, though, is toward independent developers and that's going to be key to the success
            of this generation of consoles,' Wong said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's also some consternation among gamers
            about the ability to buy and sell, or share, used games. Microsoft issued a statement last week saying it's
            'designing Xbox One to enable customers to trade in and resell games' and that more details would be shared
            later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early Adopters &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As demand for personal computers wanes, the
            Xbox is one of Microsoft's better-performing businesses. Sales in the entertainment and devices unit,
            including Xbox, rose 56 percent in the latest quarter to $2.53 billion. Underscoring the changing fortunes
            for companies at the intersection of software and consumer electronics, Microsoft shares have risen 24
            percent over the past five years, compared with Sony's 58 percent slump. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fanatical
            gamers matter because they're vocal, Blau said. As early adopters, they buy consoles as soon as they come
            out. While many will eventually buy a second console later in the cycle, which one they buy first matters
            for game sales and in setting trends. Such consumers spend 140 percent more on games than the average buyer,
            according to NPD Group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exclusive Titles &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm a real believer that
            first, second and third areas of focus are about the game,' John Riccitiello, who was CEO of Electronic Arts
            Inc. (EA) until March, said in an interview earlier this month. 'At least for the console business, the
            gamer is what carries the industry, and that the gamer needs to be well supported, because they've been left
            without a hardware choice for nearly a decade.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans 15 exclusive
            titles in Xbox One's first year, with eight of those from new franchises. The company has already shown two
            -- a sequel to the Forza Motorsport franchise and a new game called 'Quantum Break.' Games made only for one
            console are critical because, if they're successful, they can boost hardware sales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The
            only thing that really matters is that gamers are happy when they can actually go out and buy one of these
            things,' said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among
            sports titles, Electronics Arts said there would be exclusive content for Xbox. Activision Blizzard Inc.
            (ATVI) gave the first look at the new 'Call of Duty: Ghosts,' the latest in a franchise that's the top
            seller on Xbox. Downloadable content for that game will also come to Xbox before PlayStation 4, Activision
            said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Games First &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which entered the console market in
            2001, has proved before that it can appeal to hard-core gamers. The company challenged Sony's PlayStation 2
            with titles such as 'Halo' and Ubisoft Entertainment SA (UBI)'s 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.' Microsoft was
            a pioneer in hardware and services that let players connect to the Internet and interact amid play. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft in the past has been first and foremost about gaming and satisfying that core audience,'
            said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Microsoft pledges to show
            games at E3 that are equally appealing to frequent gamers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'If Microsoft doesn't deliver
            on its promise, the negative sentiment that started will only get louder,' Blau said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Salesforce.com
            Inc. (CRM) agreed to make some of their business-software products
            work better together, signaling a thaw between two longtime
            rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Salesforce's customer-management programs will become
            available for Microsoft's Windows and Windows Phone operating
            systems, and will work with Office 365 online productivity
            software, the companies said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The agreement marks a shift in what has sometimes been a
            fractious relationship. In 2010, Microsoft sued Salesforce for
            patent infringement, setting off a countersuit before the
            companies settled later that year. Microsoft in 2005 also
            announced plans to 'give Salesforce a very effective run for
            their money' with a competing product and in 2010 ran an anti-Salesforce ad campaign with the tagline 'Don't
            Get Forced.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, Redmond,
            Washington-based Microsoft has been looking to bolster its
            Internet-based cloud software and corporate programs. Software
            makers are looking for more ways to let applications, even from
            rivals, work together as customers seek to use multiple products
            and share information. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This announcement is really about putting our customers
            first,' Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            The companies are also talking about integrating data from Salesforce products into Microsoft's Office

        <headline>Microsoft Updates Windows Software After Complaints</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is restoring some old
            Windows features and rolling out new ones in a bid to reignite
            interest in its flagship operating system, after customers
            complained about the software's usability. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Windows 8 debuted in October for tablets and personal
            computers with a tile-based layout for selecting programs,
            replacing a desktop design that let users start programs from a
            button. An update later this year will restore the start button,
            while adding search capabilities and other features, said Jensen
            Harris, director of program management for Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which redesigned its main product to appeal to
            users switching to mobile, touch-based computing, has failed to
            jump-start growth in the ailing PC market with Windows 8. While
            tweaking designs and adding features will help, Microsoft needs
            more applications running on Windows and a greater variety of
            low-cost machines to stem the defection of consumers to tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I'm not sure this helps them restore demand by itself,'
            said Wes Miller, an analyst at Kirkland, Washington-based
            Directions on Microsoft. 'Bringing people back to Windows is a
            question of apps and a device-cost question -- right now you
            have to pay a premium price in general.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The update will let users set their machines to run the
            previous desktop design as a default, rather than the new tiled
            layout, Harris said. Windows 8.1 will also offer greater
            flexibility to tweak the start screen's tiles, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said it will
            release a test version of the Windows update on June 26. The
            company will ship the final product later this year as a free
            update for Windows 8 customers, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Interim Upgrade &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Users who are unfamiliar with the new design of Windows 8
            had complained about the removal of the start button and menu,
            and that Windows 8 machines only booted up to the new tiled
            design. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the update, the start button is visible when users touch
            or move a mouse at the screen's bottom-left corner. Previously,
            Microsoft had a small image in that corner which also brought up
            the start screen. The latest changes to Windows represent a move
            forward rather than a retrenchment, said Antoine Leblond, vice
            president of Windows program management. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is anything but a U-turn,' Leblond said in an
            interview. 'There's no question that our view is this modern
            world is the future, and we want more apps developed on this
            part of the platform.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Features &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Windows 8 allowed users to run two programs side by
            side, the update will add the ability to adjust how much of the
            screen is given to each one. For larger displays, the software
            will let users open as many as four applications at once. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new software, code-named Blue, adds new search features
            that return a wider variety of types of results. A search for
            Marilyn Monroe lists her page in Windows 8's Wikipedia app,
            songs in various music apps, movie clips in other apps, as well
            as web results. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lock screen for Windows 8.1 will feature a slide show
            of photos, and users will be able to answer Skype Web-based
            calls without unlocking the machine. The automatically updating
            tiles come in new sizes, from a small one to fit more apps on
            the screen to a very large format that can show several recent
            e-mails or appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;PC Slump &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The changes are being introduced as Microsoft faces a
            second straight year of shrinking PC shipments, according to
            IDC. While tablet shipments are projected to climb 59 percent
            this year and outpace PCs in 2015, sales of Surface, the
            Microsoft's tablet computer featuring Windows 8, are off to a
            slow start, falling short of predictions, people familiar with
            the matter said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One issue, particularly for tablet customers, has been the
            lack of applications for Windows 8, compared with more than
            350,000 apps for Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPad. Windows now has about 79,000
            apps, according to MetroStore Scanner, a website that tracks how
            many apps are in the Windows store. Microsoft has added a new
            health and fitness program, as well as a recipe one that can be
            controlled with gestures to enable users who are cooking to keep
            dirty fingers off the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the Windows 8 update is a concession by Microsoft
            that the new operating system may have turned off some
            customers, the software maker isn't backing away from its new
            design, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'That's not giving in -- that's just changing it to be
            more usable,' Miller of Directions on Microsoft said. 'People
            need to realize Microsoft isn't just going back to the way
            Windows 7 was.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Salesforce.com
            Inc. (CRM) plan to announce an agreement that will enable customers of
            Microsoft's cloud-computing service to use Salesforce's
            enterprise software, said people familiar with the talks,
            signaling a thaw between two longtime rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The partnership will make Salesforce's customer-management
            programs available on Microsoft's Azure service, said the
            people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
            are confidential. Salesforce will also commit to using Azure to
            host some of its own applications and will integrate data from
            Salesforce products into Microsoft's Office programs, the people
            said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;An agreement would mark a shift in what has sometimes been
            a fractious relationship between the two companies. In 2010,
            Microsoft sued Salesforce for patent infringement, setting off a
            countersuit before the companies settled later that year.
            Microsoft in 2005 also announced plans to 'give Salesforce a
            very effective run for their money' with a competing product
            and in 2010 ran an anti-Salesforce ad campaign with the tagline
            'Don't Get Forced.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nortel European Units Seek Slice of Asset Auction Cash Hoard &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)'s defunct units in the U.K. and
            Europe deserve part of the bankrupt telecom company's $7.3
            billion cash hoard because of their technology researchers' past
            work, an investment banker said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Paul Huffard, a senior managing director at Blackstone
            Group LP called to testify by the European units, argued May 28
            in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, that the best way to
            split the cash is based on the research and development by
            Nortel's regional units. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Using that method, disputed by Nortel's defunct U.S. and
            Canadian components, the U.K. and European units deserve about
            18 percent of the cash, Huffard said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The contingents are in the third week of a six-week trial
            over how to divide money raised in auctions after what was once
            North America's largest telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt
            in 2009. The money includes proceeds of a patent sale that
            raised $4.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The units are arguing on behalf of creditors including
            bondholders in the U.S. and pensioners in the U.K. and Canada.
            Each group is trying to convince a U.S. bankruptcy judge and a
            Canadian judge that its method for dividing the money is best. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Nortel Networks Inc., 09-bk-10138, U.S.
            Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Sanrio's Hello Kitty, Comic Book Hero Items Seized in Singapore &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sanrio Co. (8136)'s Hello Kitty items were among counterfeit
            merchandise seized in a raid by Singapore Customs May 20. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Enforcement officers from the customs service found a 40-foot container containing toys, water
            bottles and accessories
            with unauthorized Hello Kitty, Batman, Captain America, Spider-Man, Superman, Transformers, Barney and Care
            Bears marks, the
            service said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The goods came from Shenzhen, China, and the customs
            service said it found more infringing merchandise in the office
            of the importer who was bringing in the container. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;HR Block Settles Suit Over 'Peace of Mind' Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;HR Block Inc. (HRB) of Kansas City, Missouri, and a competing
            tax-preparation service settled their trademark dispute,
            according to a May 19 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit involved Fast Cash Taxes LLC's alleged
            unauthorized use of HR Block's 'Peace of Mind' trademark. HR
            Block sued Fast Cash, of Doraville, Georgia, in Atlanta federal
            court on March 28, seeking a court order barring unauthorized
            use of the mark and awards of money damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court filing didn't disclose terms of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is HRB Innovations Inc. v. Fast Cash Taxes LLC,
            14-cv-00903, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia
            (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;More than 1.3 Million Copyright Alert Notices Sent, Center Says &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Center for Copyright Information, an advocacy group
            comprising copyright holders and Internet service providers,
            issued a report on the 'six strikes' copyright alert system in
            place in the U.S. since February 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;More than 1.3 million notices were sent to consumers in the
            past year, with 70 percent sent at the first stage of what can
            be an escalating alert and mitigation system, according to the
            report. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under a policy set up when the system was put into place,
            the American Arbitration Association reviews challenges filed by
            consumers who say the notices were erroneous. In the past year,
            only 265 requests were filed, according to the center. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), creator of the world's most-used Internet
            search engine, backed down on its claims that numbers reflecting
            the ethnic and gender makeup of its workforce were a trade
            secret. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In a report published on the Mountain View, California-based company's official blog May 28, Google
            said that it was in
            the wrong when it refused to release the data. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company revealed that 70 percent of its employees are
            male and 61 percent are white. Only 2 percent of its workforce
            is black, Google said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Valve Lines Up Console Partners in Challenge to Microsoft, Sony</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Valve Corp., the largest online
            retailer of games downloaded to PCs, is working with 'more than
            a dozen' partners, including computer makers, to begin selling
            consoles that take on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Sony Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The closely held company, maker of the 'Half-Life'
            titles, will introduce the companies in early January at the
            Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, said Greg Coomer, one of
            the lead designers. They plan to produce and sell the consoles
            next year using variations of Valve's prototype design,
            controller and Steam operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'There's different categories of partner,' Coomer said in
            an interview. 'Some of them will be able to serve millions of
            Steam customers, some of them are boutique shops.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valve is taking the offensive as its own market is invaded
            by Microsoft, Sony and others, banking on global base of
            personal-computer gamers to seize some of the $15 billion market
            for home consoles. Microsoft and Sony (6758), which are introducing new
            machines for the holidays, have started their own Internet
            portals to duplicate Steam's success selling games, as have Wii
            U maker Nintendo (7974) and Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The SteamOS machines will sell for different prices and
            configurations, the Bellevue, Washington-based company said.
            Depending on those, some Steam games may not play on each
            device. This month, the company plans to test the devices with
            300 users to polish features before next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valve also is working with music and movie services to
            deliver streamed entertainment to the machines, Coomer said.
            With Internet access, game consoles have evolved into
            entertainment hubs, providing movies, TV shows and music from
            Netflix Inc. (NFLX) and Pandora Media Inc. (P) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Market Share &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valve captures 75 percent of the global market for digital
            PC games through its Steam store, researcher IHS Screen Digest
            has estimated. While the company doesn't disclose sales, digital
            distribution of PC games this year will comprise $5.5 billion of
            the $21.4 billion computer games market, according to DFC
            Intelligence, another researcher. IHS estimates Valve generated
            $1.1 billion in 2012 from full-game downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To get developers to go along, Valve is passing up the
            licensing fees that competitors charge for access to their
            systems. Valve plans to hold a developers conference in January,
            according to company officials. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The main goal of Steam has always been to increase the
            quality of the user's experience by reducing the distance
            between content creators and their audience,' Gabe Newell,
            Valve's co-founder, said in an Oct. 30 statement. 'In the
            coming year, we plan to make perhaps our most significant
            collaborations with both communities through the Steam Dev Days
            and the Steam Machines beta.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wooing Developers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steam's business is also threatened by the console makers'
            plans to include games compatible with Unity Technologies, which
            offers a game-development engine to create products for
            different platforms. Valve is trying to woo the same developers
            by promising they can post updates and fixes immediately,
            without waiting for the usual approvals required by big brands. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SteamOS adds features to the Steam service across all
            platforms, including family sharing, and in-home streaming.
            Because it's based on the Linux operating system, developers
            must create games using that software. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft CEO Candidate Elop Said to Mull Windows Shift</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stephen Elop, a candidate to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft Corp.'s chief executive officer,
            would consider breaking with decades of tradition by focusing the company's strategy around making the
            popular Office software programs like Word, Excel and PowerPoint available on a broad variety of smartphones
            and tablets, including those made by Apple Inc. and Google Inc., said three people with knowledge of his
            thinking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elop would probably move away from Microsoft's strategy of using these
            programs to drive demand for its flagship Windows operating system on personal computers and mobile devices,
            said the people, who asked not to be identified because the 49-year-old executive hasn't finalized or
            publicly discussed his analysis of the business. Most of Microsoft's software has been tied to running on
            Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft became the world's largest software provider under Ballmer and
            co-founder Bill Gates by making Windows-based PCs running Office applications an industry standard. When the
            Redmond, Washington-based company failed to come up with hit Windows-based phones and tablets, that left it
            with little role in the mobile market. Its refusal to adapt Office for Apple and devices based on Google's
            Android operating system hasn't helped its software usage. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
            Stephen Elop resigned as Nokia's CEO when the sale was announced, and said he would become head of a new
            Microsoft devices unit responsible for hardware such as the Surface tablet and Xbox game console. Close

        <headline>Microsoft Patent Chief to Join Shook Hardy: Business of Law</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft Corp. chief patent
            counsel Bart Eppenauer is joining Shook, Hardy Bacon LLP as a
            partner and will be the managing partner of the firm's new
            Seattle office, opening Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eppenauer, who was chief patent counsel at Microsoft
            starting in 2003, led the patent group in the legal and
            corporate affairs department, where he developed Microsoft's
            portfolio of more than 35,000 issued patents worldwide, the firm
            said. He also managed a team of more than 100 patent
            professionals and worked closely with government and judicial
            officials, academics and industry leaders on IP policy issues. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Eppenauer was an associate for three years in Shook's
            intellectual property practice before leaving to join
            Microsoft's legal team in 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We are extremely excited to be opening a Seattle office
            and to have Bart rejoining the firm,' Shook Chairman John
            Murphy said in a statement. 'Bart's legal and business
            experience is unparalleled and this was a truly unique
            opportunity for us to open an office in a region in which we
            already have a substantial footprint from a practice
            standpoint.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Shook is among Microsoft's 'premier provider' firms for
            legal services, the firm said. The firm's intellectual property
            group includes 58 attorneys, 42 of whom are registered to
            practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I have worked closely with Shook's intellectual property
            group for more than a decade in my role at Microsoft and I am
            very pleased to be rejoining them,' Eppenauer said in a
            statement. 'Shook is a standout, forward-looking firm in terms
            of delivering creative, efficient and highly effective legal
            services to their clients.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Seattle office will be Shook's ninth in the U.S. and
            11th worldwide. The firm has more than 440 attorneys. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It will be a smaller office at the outset, but offer the
            highest quality in terms of experience and service to our
            clients,' Murphy said. 'That has been a successful blueprint
            throughout the history of our firm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Latham Environmental Lawyer Nominated for Interior Post &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Obama will nominate Janice Schneider, a partner
            in law firm Latham Watkins LLP, to be assistant secretary for
            land and minerals management in the Interior Department,
            Bloomberg BNA's Alan Kovski reports, citing a White House
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If confirmed, Schneider will oversee the Bureau of Land
            Management, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of Safety
            and Environmental Enforcement, and Office of Surface Mining
            Reclamation and Enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Schneider, a partner in Latham's Washington office, is
            global co-chairman of the firm's energy and infrastructure
            project siting and defense practice and local department
            chairman of the environment, land and resources department. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Before joining Latham in 2001, Schneider worked for the
            U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Justice Department
            and was counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the Interior,
            according to her firm biography. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;New York Lawyer Wells to Lead NFL's Workplace Probe of Dolphins &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell said
            there's no time limit for an independent probe into alleged
            harassment in the Miami Dolphins' workplace, which will be led
            by New York attorney Ted Wells. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells, a senior partner in the law firm of Paul Weiss
            Rifkind Wharton Garrison LLP, will direct 'a thorough and
            objective' investigation and submit a report to Goodell, the
            NFL said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ted Wells will have full authority to investigate as he
            deems appropriate,' Goodell said. 'Consistent with doing a
            thorough investigation, we have not imposed a specific timetable
            on him.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Dolphins asked the NFL to investigate allegations that
            harassment led Jonathan Martin to leave the team. Fellow
            offensive lineman Richie Incognito was indefinitely suspended. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I am committed to creating a professional environment for
            all of the members of the Dolphins family,' Dolphins owner
            Stephen Ross said in an e-mailed statement. 'Once the review is
            completed and I have all of the facts, we will respond
            accordingly.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ross said the Dolphins will be 'fully cooperating with the
            review,' while Miami coach Joe Philbin said the team will take
            'all necessary steps' to correct anything that Wells finds
            amiss. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ESPN reported that Incognito, 30, asked Martin, 24, to
            contribute financially to an unofficial team trip to Las Vegas
            that Martin didn't attend. The network also said the Dolphins
            and the NFL have a copy of a voice message from April in which
            Incognito used a racial slur and threatened Martin's life. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;David Dunn, Incognito's agent, hasn't responded to multiple
            e-mails and a message left at his office seeking comment on the
            ESPN reports. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Billy Hunter's firing in February as head of the National
            Basketball Players Association came after an audit of the union
            overseen by Wells. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The review concluded that, while Hunter did nothing
            illegal, he failed to manage conflicts of interest, lacked
            proper corporate governance and didn't disclose that his $3
            million-a-year contract wasn't properly ratified. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wells also was involved in an internal investigation into
            the men's basketball program at Syracuse University, where
            federal prosecutors in November 2012 dropped a yearlong probe
            into former assistant coach Bernie Fine, saying there wasn't
            enough evidence against him to support allegations of sexual
            abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'My task is to assemble the facts and present my findings
            to the commissioner,' said Wells, whose report for Goodell will
            be made public. 'I will do so fairly and comprehensively so
            that Commissioner Goodell can address this matter properly. I
            will begin my work immediately and report my findings to the
            commissioner as soon as practical.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Deals &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cravath Represents Toll Brothers on Shapell Acquisition &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cravath, Swaine Moore LLP represented Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)
            on its agreement to buy Shapell Industries Inc.'s homebuilding
            business for about $1.6 billion, gaining 5,200 lots in the Los
            Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas as buyer demand for housing
            rises. Gibson Dunn Crutcher LLP advised Shapell. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Cravath team included partners Eric L. Schiele, mergers
            and acquisitions; Stephen L. Gordon, tax; and Kevin J. Grehan,
            real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Gibson Dunn's team is co-led by Los Angeles real estate
            partners Michael Sfregola and Dhiya El-Saden and includes the
            following partners: Paul Issler, tax; Patrick Dennis, co-chairman of the environmental litigation and mass
            tort practice
            group; Maurice Suh, litigation; and Sean Feller, benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toll, the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, will pay for
            Beverly Hills, California-based Shapell with debt and a share
            offering, the companies said yesterday in a statement. The deal
            will more than double the number of California lots controlled
            by Toll to about 9,200, with most in coastal markets where
            vacant land is hard to come by, Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Developers are stocking up on land as U.S. home values
            climb at their fastest pace in seven years. Earlier this week,
            Barry Sternlicht's Irvine, California-based Tri Pointe Homes
            Inc. agreed to buy the homebuilding division of Weyerhaeuser Co.
            for $2.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the Shapell deal, 10 percent to 15 percent of the
            purchase price will be covered by issuing new Toll shares, and
            Toll plans to sell about $500 million of land from the Shapell
            portfolio. The Horsham, Pennsylvania-based builder also stands
            to make money immediately by selling homes in Shapell's backlog. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Toll will keep about 150 Shapell employees. Others with the
            company will continue to work for the family's commercial real
            estate division, which wasn't sold to Toll. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Litigation &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Police Found Blunkett Voice Mails in News Corp. Lawyer's Safe &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Recordings of voice mails left by former Home Secretary
            David Blunkett on the phone of a woman he was having an affair
            with were discovered in the safe of News Corp. (NWSA)'s U.K. lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Police found the tapes and a draft News of the World
            article about Blunkett's three-year relationship with Kimberly
            Quinn in Tom Crone's safe at News Corp.'s U.K. unit, Andrew
            Edis, a prosecution lawyer, told the jury yesterday. The
            prosecution said the story, which was published in 2004, was the
            result of phone hacking. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive officer of News
            Corp.'s U.K. unit and Andy Coulson, a 45-year-old former editor
            of the now defunct News of the World, are among eight people
            standing trial for a string of offenses stemming from wrongdoing
            at News Corp. U.K. tabloids. Crone, the company's former lawyer,
            isn't accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rupert Murdoch, the company's chairman, closed the News of
            the World tabloid in July 2011 in a bid to defuse a scandal over
            revelations journalists had hacked the phone of a missing
            teenager, Milly Dowler, who was later found murdered. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The messages related to Blunkett were 'deeply personal and
            intrusive,' Detective Constable Tim Hargreaves told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Edis played a recording of a conversation in which Coulson
            confronted the lawmaker before the story was published. Coulson
            refused to reveal his sources and said he was 'sure it was
            right.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'I wouldn't be exposing myself in this way unless I
            believed the story to be true,' Coulson, who later became a
            media adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, said to Blunkett.
            'I am confident.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The other defendants include Stuart Kuttner, the 73-year-old former managing editor of the News of
            the World, and Ian Edmondson, a 44-year-old former news editor, who are both
            accused of phone hacking. The newspaper's one-time royal
            reporter, Clive Goodman, 56, is charged with conspiring to
            commit misconduct in a public office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Brooks's husband, her former assistant Cheryl Carter, and
            the U.K. unit's former head of security, Mark Hanna, face

            &lt;h2&gt;Stop-And-Frisk Judge Removed, Fights Back &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last month, a federal appeals court panel put a hold on
            changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk
            practices and created a controversy by removing Judge Shira
            Scheindlin, who had ordered the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The panel said Scheindlin ran afoul of judicial ethics
            rules by encouraging lawyers to bring the stop-and-frisk case,
            which she would hear as 'related' to others on her docket, and
            by speaking to reporters while the case was under way. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many lawyers have come to the judge's defense. Nancy
            Gertner, a former federal judge says that the panel, not
            Scheindlin, violated the rules since no party had moved to
            disqualify her. &lt;/p&gt;

            were cleared of privacy violations related to the U.S. spying
            scandal by a Luxembourg regulator that said the companies didn't

            &lt;p&gt;The regulator conducted the investigation because the

        <headline>Google Joins Microsoft in U.K. Efforts to Block Child Porn</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron
            will introduce laws to force search engines' to cooperate if new
            efforts to curb child pornography online fail, he said today
            while lauding efforts by Google Inc. (GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron credited the two with making 'significant
            progress' in helping prevent such content from proliferating,
            in a statement ahead of today's meeting of Internet companies,
            the National Crime Agency and charities on curbing child porn. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Child abuse 'highlights the depths to which humanity can
            sink,' Google Chairman Eric Schmidt wrote in Britain's Daily
            Mail newspaper today. 'While society will never wholly
            eliminate such depravity, we should do everything in our power
            to protect children from harm.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In July, Cameron detailed his effort to stop child
            pornography and better protect children from pedophiles by
            enlisting help from companies and the law-enforcement agency.
            Since then, U.K. Internet providers have been installing home
            filters so parents can help prevent their children from being
            targeted and the largest Wi-Fi networks have activated so-called
            family-friendly filters in public areas where children may
            access the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cameron cited a 20 percent drop in Internet users searching
            for illegal content thanks to efforts by Cupertino, California-based Google. Cameron also unveiled a
            U.K.-U.S. taskforce to
            identify trans-Atlantic criminals and said the Internet Watch
            Foundation -- an industry group that identifies and removes
            illegal content -- will expand operations and recruit new
            analysts. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Bill Gates Met With 'a Lot' of Microsoft CEO Candidates</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said he and other directors have met with 'a lot of CEO
            candidates' to replace Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board convened
            yesterday to discuss some of the candidates, Gates said at the company's annual shareholder meeting in
            Bellevue, Washington, Ballmer's last before he steps down. Gates said he wouldn't give a timeline for the
            decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker is going through its biggest transition in
            decades, seeking a new leader while it adopts a new corporate structure focused on devices and services.
            Microsoft is also buying Nokia Oyj's handset unit, its largest acquisition by number of employees. The new
            CEO will have to keep pace with a shift among consumers and businesses to mobile devices and Web-delivered
            software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a complex role to fill,' Gates said. He thanked Ballmer and choking up,
            said that 'we share a commitment to make sure the next CEO is the right person for the right time for the
            company we both love.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company's directors, including Ballmer, were re-elected by a
            majority. Shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis had recommended withholding votes for lead independent
            director John Thompson, who is also leading the CEO search committee. Glass Lewis expressed concern that
            Thompson is the CEO of startup Virtual Instruments Inc., which received $2.3 million from Microsoft in
            fiscal 2013 for software and equipment. Glass Lewis considered this a conflict of interest. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Bill Gates should serve as Microsoft Corp.'s chief executive officer for a year as the software
            company he co-founded seeks a replacement for Steve Ballmer, according to Charles Schwab. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            world's largest software maker is seeking a new leader after Ballmer said in August that he would retire
            within a year. The management change is happening as Microsoft adopts a new corporate structure focused on
            devices and services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates should return to revamp Microsoft's culture, Schwab said.
            Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and confidant of the software maker's
            chairman, has ruled out the possibility of a return, and Gates isn't being considered for the role, people
            with knowledge of the matter have said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;'I think it would behoove Gates to go back for at least a year,' Schwab, the chairman of Charles
            Schwab Corp., said today at The Year Ahead: 2014 conference hosted by Bloomberg LP in Chicago. 'He's the
            only guy who can really reshape the cultural aspects. Otherwise the organization will spit anybody out,
            anybody coming in.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates, who was Microsoft's CEO until Ballmer took over in 2000, said
            at a shareholder meeting yesterday that he and other directors have met with 'a lot of CEO candidates.' The
            board is aiming to narrow the list of CEO candidates to three to five, a person with knowledge of the matter

        <headline>Microsoft Claims Acacia Patent Suits Breach Licensing Pact</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., (MSFT) the world's largest
            software maker, filed a lawsuit today claiming patent-licensing
            firm Acacia Research Corp. breached a contract between the two
            companies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The complaint was filed today under seal in federal court
            in Manhattan and a public copy wasn't available. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Acacia, which buys patents to generate a profit from
            licensing revenue, filed seven lawsuits last month against
            Microsoft in Delaware, Illinois and Texas. In the past, the two
            companies have reached agreements, including a 2011 deal over e-mail messaging and one in 2010 over patents
            for smartphone
            technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Acacia's lawsuits are the worst kind of abusive
            litigation behavior, attempting to extract payment based on
            litigation tactics and not the value of its patents,' Microsoft
            Deputy General Counsel David Howard said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Acacia, which reported $115.5 million in sales for the
            first three quarters, doesn't sue in its own name, though it has
            filed hundreds of lawsuits. Instead, it forms a unit to handle a
            specific portfolio and then the unit -- named for the technology
            it covers -- files the suits. In its annual report, the Newport
            Beach, California-based company said it had 143 'technology
            licensing programs.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The lawsuits filed in October against Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft include one for
            light-emitting panel assemblies
            and another for a way to control the use of licensed software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Adam Handelsman, a spokesman or Acacia, had no immediate
            comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Troll Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Government Accountability Office found that 19 percent
            of all patent lawsuits filed between 2007 and 2011 were by
            companies often derided as trolls, whose sole business is to buy
            up patents and then demand royalties. With changes in
            legislation that limited the number of defendants in a single
            suit, that number increased even more in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Congress is considering proposals that would limit some
            litigation practices by patent-licensing firms. The provisions
            being considered include a requirement that patent owners
            provide more details about both what the patent covers and how
            its infringed, disclose who benefits financially from the
            litigation, and make the loser in a case pay the winner's legal
            costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Acacia Research Corp. (ACTG), 13-cv-8275, U.S. District Court,
            Southern District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft to Take Over Nokia's Landmark Headquarters</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. will take over Nokia
            Oyj (NOK1V)'s glass-walled headquarters, one of Finland's best-known
            buildings, once the software giant's deal to buy the Finnish
            company's mobile-phone business is completed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia will move to a location further away from central
            Helsinki, to a campus where its network-equipment business is
            based, James Etheridge, a spokesman for the Finnish company,
            said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft gains occupancy of a landmark complex whose
            construction in the 1990s symbolized Nokia's rise into Finland's
            first major global corporation. The building, just outside
            Helsinki in Espoo, is by the shore and offers expansive views to
            the Baltic Sea from its meeting rooms. It is situated on a busy
            highway between Finland's two biggest cities and is seen by tens
            of thousands of commuters every day. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Karaportti campus, where Nokia will move, is further
            inland in Espoo and resembles more of a traditional industrial
            estate. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia's shareholders agreed this week to sell its device
            unit to Microsoft in a 5.44 billion-euro ($7.3 billion) deal.
            The majority of workers in the current head office, which Nokia
            sold last year and leased back to cut costs, work for the unit
            to be acquired by Microsoft. Nokia is renovating a building at
            the Karaportti campus for its future use, Etheridge said. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. said it sold more than 1 million Xbox One video-game consoles in less than a day
            after the new machine went on sale in 13 countries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tally surpassed first-day sales
            for the predecessor Xbox 360 and set a record for Microsoft, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
            yesterday in a statement. The Xbox One went on sale in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany,
            Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, the U.K. and U.S. after the company cut eight countries from the
            initial sales list, citing production issues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sony Corp. said on Nov. 17 that it sold
            more than 1 million PlayStation 4 consoles in North America in the first day of release, topping initial
            sales for the predecessor PlayStation 3 in 2006. The PS4 goes on sale Nov. 29 in 30 countries in Europe and
            Latin America, followed by Japan on Feb. 22. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two companies are competing for the
            attention of gamers and trying to revive a console market that shrank 32 percent to $13.3 billion from 2008
            to 2012, according to market researcher NPD Group. Both are offering machines with upgraded graphics and
            more entertainment tie-ins. The Xbox One sells for $499, while the PlayStation 4 is offered for $399. &lt;/p&gt;

            considered less likely to be offered the job, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
            deliberations are private. Preferences remain fluid and other people are being considered and could emerge
            as front-runners, said one of the people, without identifying any. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board is aiming
            for a quick replacement for longtime CEO Steve Ballmer, who said in August that he will retire within the
            next 12 months. The Redmond, Washington-based company has seen its software leadership decline amid a
            shrinking of the personal-computer market, which was its core business. Microsoft is shifting strategy to
            focus more on hardware and Internet-based services and away from its software roots as it competes with
            Apple Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank Shaw, a spokesman at Microsoft, declined to comment or

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden succeeded where President Barack
            Obama couldn't -- getting Microsoft Corp., Google Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. to upgrade computer security against
            hackers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The companies are adopting harder-to-crack code to protect their networks and
            data, after years of largely rebuffing calls from the White House and privacy advocates to improve security.
            The new measures come after documents from Snowden revealed how U.S. spy programs gain access to the
            companies' customer data -- sometimes with their knowledge, sometimes without -- and that's threatening
            profits at home and abroad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'These companies actively fought against numerous mechanisms

            price.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Facebook Inc. provide data to the government
            under court orders, they are trying to prevent the NSA from gaining unauthorized access to information
            flowing between computer servers by using encryption. That scrambles data using a mathematical formula that
            can be decoded only with a special digital key. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Case Against Google's Motorola Partly Revived</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won't be able to seek
            a second import ban against some handsets made by Google Inc. (GOOG)'s
            Motorola Mobility, though it can get damages under a ruling
            issued by a U.S. appeals court today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A U.S. trade agency was wrong to say some of Motorola
            Mobility's products didn't infringe one Microsoft patent, while
            there was no violation of three others, the U.S. Court of
            Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington said in an opinion
            posted on its website today. The remaining patent expires in
            December, so there won't be enough time for a trade agency to
            block the devices from being imported into the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The ruling does give Microsoft ammunition to seek cash
            damages from Motorola Mobility in a U.S. district court. Both
            sides declared victory, with Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
            saying it bolsters its efforts to get royalties from devices
            running on Google's Android, the world's most popular operating
            system. Motorola Mobility is one of the biggest holdouts of a
            program started three years ago, Microsoft has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're pleased the court determined Google unfairly uses
            Microsoft technology and once again call on Google to join the
            rest of the Android ecosystem in licensing our patents,'
            Microsoft Deputy General Counsel David Howard said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which was bought by Mountain View,
            California-based Google after the case was filed in 2010,
            focused on the findings regarding the other three patents and
            the court finding that Motorola Mobility designed around the one
            that was infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Today's favorable opinion confirms our position that our
            products don't infringe the Microsoft patents,' said Matt Kallman, a Motorola Mobility spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;79 Percent &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Had Motorola Mobility lost on any of the three other
            patents, it would have faced another possible import ban. as
            each has at least three years left on their terms, according to
            the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court didn't rule on Google's appeal of a separate
            patent in the dispute before the U.S. International Trade
            Commission. In that case, the ITC issued an import ban against
            some Motorola Mobility phones. Microsoft has sued U.S. Customs
            and Border Protection, claiming it hasn't enforced the order. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Android had 79 percent of the global market in the second
            quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft's
            operating system was third with 3.6 percent, with Apple Inc.
            having 13.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patent claim that was revived against Motorola Mobility
            involves a digital interface that presents relevant choices when
            a user selects a computer resource, such as a picture file. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;ActiveSync Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit said the ITC erred in its
            interpretation of a key term in that patent. It sent the case
            back to determine the type of infringement by the main group of
            Motorola Mobility products and what, if any, the appropriate
            remedy would be. Other devices that designed around the patent
            were cleared of infringement by the appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel affirmed a finding that Motorola
            Mobility doesn't infringe a patent for synchronizing data. That
            patent is similar to one involved in the infringement ruling
            Google is appealing, relating to syncing calendar items between
            mobile devices and computers. It involves Microsoft's ActiveSync
            software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The court also upheld the ITC's determination that
            Microsoft hadn't established that it was using the technology
            covered by the other two patents, a requirement that's unique to
            the trade agency. The panel didn't address the ITC's finding
            those patents weren't infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Xbox Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A Motorola Mobility case against Microsoft, seeking to
            block imports of the Xbox video-gaming system, failed at the ITC
            and is on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In connection with that case, Microsoft has accused
            Motorola Mobility of demanding unreasonable fees on fundamental
            technology used in many electronics. Microsoft won a trial last
            week on its claims that Motorola Mobility breached obligations
            to license its standard-essential patents on fair terms. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case that was ruled on is Microsoft Corp. v. ITC,
            12-1445, while the pending case is Motorola Mobility LLC v. ITC,
            12-1535, both U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
            (Washington). The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile
            Devices, Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744,
            U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Said to Ask HTC for Windows on Android Phones</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is talking to HTC
            Corp. (2498) about adding its Windows operating system to HTC's
            Android-based smartphones at little or no cost, people with
            knowledge of the matter said, evidence of the software maker's
            struggle to gain ground in the mobile market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft's operating systems unit,
            asked HTC last month to load Windows Phone as a second option on
            handsets with Google Inc. (GOOG)'s rival software, said the people, who
            asked not to be identified because the talks are private.
            Myerson discussed cutting or eliminating the license fee to make
            the idea more attractive, the people said. The talks are
            preliminary and no decision has been made, two people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Its willingness to add Windows as a second operating
            system underscores the lengths to which Microsoft will go to get
            manufacturers to carry its software. HTC, the first company to
            make both Windows and Android phones, hasn't unveiled a new
            Windows-based handset since June and has no current plans to
            release any more, said one person. Microsoft, with 3.7 percent
            of the market, is finding it necessary to make concessions after
            agreeing to acquire Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit, which competes
            with other smartphone makers. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;SmartMetric Loses Patent Ruling in Visa, MasterCard Case &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) don't infringe a patent owned
            by SmartMetric Inc., a company that had sought as much as $13.4
            billion for alleged use of its technology in 'smart' debit and
            credit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald in Los Angeles,
            affirmed his earlier tentative decision from a Sept. 25 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The parties here are comparing apples and oranges,' the
            judge said in an Oct. 2 written ruling. 'The piecemeal
            similarities that SmartMetric has identified in support of its
            claims do not change the fact that claims 1 and 14 of the '464
            patent are simply not practiced by defendants, and no reasonable
            jury could conclude otherwise.'' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SmartMetric sued Visa and MasterCard two years ago,
            claiming they infringed its patent for a system for automatic
            connection to a network. The company claimed it was entitled to
            a royalty of 25 percent of the anticipated savings Visa and
            MasterCard would receive from a drop in credit and debit-card
            fraud by the introduction of so-called EMV cards in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The EMV cards, which are already used in Europe, include a
            microchip instead of a magnetic strip to access a payment
            system. The SmartMetric patent pertains to the process by which
            the payment system selects a network for a card transaction,
            Patrick Bright, the company's lawyer, said at the Sept. 25
            hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;SmartMetric said in a statement yesterday it will appeal
            the non-infringement ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is SmartMetric Inc. (SMME) v. MasterCard International
            Inc., 11-cv-07126, U.S. District Court, Central District of
            California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Government Shutdown Forces Cancellation of Inventors' Meeting &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled its 18th
            annual Independent Inventors Conference set for Oct. 11-12 in
            Alexandria, Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to a notice on the patent office website, the
            office will stay open notwithstanding the government shutdown
            that began Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patent office said that it had to make ''difficult
            decisions to ensure core patent and trademark operations are
            maintained for as long as possible.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The office, which operates on user fees, said it is should
            be able to stay open for about four weeks using previous year's
            fee reserves. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the world's largest e-commerce company,
            applied to register the term 'Firetube' as a trademark,
            according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The application, filed Sept. 25, indicates that the
            Seattle-based company plans to use the mark for a wide range of
            services, including online social-networking, a mobile software
            application, and the dissemination of advertising via the
            Internet and other communications networks. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other uses for the mark, Amazon says, are the provision of
            non-downloadable pre-recorded content via wireless networks,
            communication through portable electronic devices, electronic
            mail services and graphic design services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Kentucky Restaurant Successful in Defense of 'Derby Pie' Mark &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kern's Kitchen Inc., a Kentucky restaurant that's been in
            business for more than 50 years, won a trademark battle against
            a restaurant that was started by the founder of the Kentucky
            Fried Chicken chain. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The dispute was over a pie that is associated with the
            Kentucky Derby horse race. According to the database of the U.S.
            Patent and Trademark Office, Louisville, Kentucky-based Kern's
            Kitchen began using the name 'Derby Pie' in 1964, and
            registered it as a U.S. trademark in October 1969. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company said on its website that the pie, which has
            chocolate chips and walnuts among its ingredients, is a secret
            recipe and 'no one has ever been able to duplicate our special
            filling and delicate crust.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That hasn't stopped many people from trying. A Google
            search for the terms 'Derby Pie' and 'Recipe' yields more
            than 48,000 hits. Kern's Kitchen has successfully filed other
            trademark suits related to the pie's name. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Kern's Kitchen objected to the use of the term 'derby
            pie' to describe a dessert served at Claudia Sanders Dinner
            Houses Inc., of Shelbyville, Kentucky, and filed an infringement
            suit in federal court in March. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;According to the Dinner Houses website, the restaurant was
            founded in 1968 by Harland Sanders, and originally known as
            'The Colonel's Lady.' Sanders sold his Kentucky Fried Chicken
            company to a group of investors in 1964, and the chain is now a
            unit of Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) He and his wife Claudia, inspired by
            their 'knowledge of Southern Recipes and their natural leaning
            toward the restaurant,' then opened The Colonel's Lady. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sanders died in 1980 at the age of 94, and his widow died
            in 1996, at the same age. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In its complaint, Kern's Kitchen said that it renewed its
            trademark in 2009 and didn't authorize the mark's use by the
            defendant. It asked the court for an order barring further
            infringement and damages of $335,000 together with awards of
            attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 1 a federal court in Frankfort, Kentucky, issued an
            order permanently barring Dinner Houses' use of 'Derby Pie,'
            and dismissing all other claims. The court said each party must
            pay its own attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Dinner Houses' menu lists a dessert containing chocolate
            chips and pecans that is now named 'Claudia's Kentucky Pie.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Kern's Kitchen Inc. v. Claudia Sanders Dinner
            Houses Inc., 3:13-cv-00013-GFVT, U.S. District Court, Eastern
            District of Kentucky (Frankfort). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Pennsylvania Theater Sued Again by Broadway Copyright Holders &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Entertainment Theatre Group, which does business as
            American Music Theatre, was sued for the second time in two
            weeks for infringing copyrights of Broadway musicals. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The first suit was filed in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Sept.

            &lt;h2&gt;Canada Defense Department Move May Be Security Risk &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canada's Department of National Defense is taking a second
            look at plans to move into facilities previously occupied by the
            now-defunct Nortel Networks Corp. after listening devices were
            discovered there, the Ottawa Citizen reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Internet and communications provider was the target of
            industrial espionage beginning in 2000 and security analysts say
            bugs and other devices from the Nortel era may still be found at
            the site, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Department of National Defense hasn't revealed whether
            the bugs found were new or dated from Nortel's occupancy, the
            newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Canada's federal government, which has dedicated almost
            $1 billion Canadian ($968 million) to the purchase and the
            renovation of the site, has said it may consider having other
            departments move there rather than the defense department,
            according to the Citizen. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft's $7.2 Billion Nokia Bet Not Luring Apps</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s $7.2 billion pairing with Nokia Oyj (NOK)'s handset business is failing to
            win over the software developers who are crucial to its success. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider Tommy Palm and
            Jeff Smith. Palm, who oversees development at smartphone-game maker King.com, and Smith, who runs
            music-application maker Smule Inc., have long avoided building apps for devices using Microsoft's Windows
            Phone software. Closer ties with Nokia haven't swayed them. Both say even after the acquisition closes,
            Microsoft still won't have enough users to make it worth the time and money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'With or
            without Nokia, Microsoft needs to demonstrate that they can capture a material segment of the mobile
            market,' Smith said in an interview. 'We will wait and see.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has
            struggled to lure developers since Windows Phone debuted in 2010, the plight has taken on new urgency since
            Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer announced the acquisition of Nokia's handset unit last month.
            Microsoft, which had close ties with Nokia through a 2011 partnership, is counting on the deal to boost its
            share of the $280 billion smartphone market and to lure makers of games, productivity tools and other apps,
            who view the company's mobile software as an afterthought compared with Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iOS and Google
            Inc. (GOOG)'s Android. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Board Said to Work on Hiring New CEO This Year</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s board is working toward having the successor to Chief Executive Officer
            Steve Ballmer in place by the end of this year and is winnowing a list of candidates, said people with
            knowledge of the discussions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The board is narrowing its choices amid preliminary
            interviews, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Some candidates
            have declined to be considered, including EBay Inc. (EBAY) CEO John Donahoe, said two people. The board has
            also solicited advice from Silicon Valley veterans such as Charles Giancarlo, a former Cisco Systems Inc.
            executive and now a managing director at private-equity firm Silver Lake, said other people with knowledge
            of the matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Board members have already spoken with candidates such as Ford Motor Co.
            (F) CEO Alan Mulally; former Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) CEO Stephen Elop, who will join Microsoft when its $7.2
            billion acquisition of Nokia's handset unit closes; former Microsoft No. 3 executive Paul Maritz, who is now
            CEO of cloud venture Pivotal; and Microsoft business development and evangelism chief Tony Bates, said the
            people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The precise timing of a CEO announcement will depend on negotiations over
            matters like compensation and, in the case of an external candidate, departure from their current company,
            said the people. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Weeks before Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief
            Executive Officer Steve Ballmer announced plans to retire, lead
            independent director John Thompson spelled out the board's
            responsibility in an on-campus interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Ours is not a role where we devise the strategy,'
            Thompson told Microsoft's internal Channel 9 site on Aug. 7.
            'Our role is really to say, 'Here's what we think about what
            we've heard, here's what we like, quite frankly, here's what we
            don't like.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;During Thompson's almost 20 months on Microsoft's board,
            directors were frank about what they didn't like about the
            company's performance under Ballmer, regulatory filings show.
            The board, in annual reviews, rebuked the CEO for poor results
            in Windows and tablets machines, even as it lauded areas such as
            server software and expense cutting. They paid him less than his
            maximum possible bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Thompson combined candor with his experience as a 42-year
            technology industry veteran to lead the board's discussion of
            company strategy, helping to create an environment that sped
            Ballmer's decision to retire, according to people with knowledge
            of the matter. Thompson, 64, listened to each board member and
            made sure Ballmer heard them, improving lines of communication
            and making strategy talks more productive, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled Windows Phone software for smartphone-tablet hybrids as well as
            more powerful chips as the company plays catchup to Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) in mobile
            devices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bigger start menu with higher-resolution displays will enable the software to
            run on phones with five- and six-inch screens for the first time, Microsoft said today in a blog post. The
            update to Windows Phone 8 will roll out to developers tomorrow and customers in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;After losing out in smartphones and tablets to Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS
            software, Microsoft is trying to appeal to consumers in the middle. Global shipments of so-called phablets
            will more than double to 60.4 million this year, research firm IHS predicted in January. That's a fraction
            of the more than 1 billion smartphones researcher IDC expects to be shipped. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj
            (NOK1V), which is selling its handset unit to Microsoft for $7.2 billion, released a promotion for its Oct.
            22 Nokia World event, featuring an image of a phablet. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is acquiring
            the business in a bid to jumpstart its phone efforts while also trying to lure other manufacturers to its
            mobile operating system. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Asked by EU Privacy Watchdogs to 'Improve' Policies</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was asked by
            European Union data-protection regulators to tweak policies for
            its Internet products including Hotmail and Bing search engine
            as part of a formal probe into possible privacy issues. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Data regulators 'identified a number of areas where
            improvements are required,' the EU group said in a statement.
            'Microsoft was asked to send its response very shortly,
            explaining how and when it would implement' the
            recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Updates to Microsoft's services agreement, which took
            effect last year on Oct. 19 have been formally reviewed by EU
            regulators, with the data-protection commissions for Luxembourg
            and France leading the investigation. Google Inc. has also come
            under fire by the 28 EU data-protection regulators, who work
            together in the so-called Article 29 Data Protection Working
            Party. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The authorities 'are confident that an agreement will soon
            be found,' Gerard Lommel, head of the Luxembourg regulator,
            said in an interview today. The Luxembourg and French 'have
            appreciated the transparent cooperation of Microsoft,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Data protection is currently policed by separate regulators
            across the EU. As part of an overhaul of the union's 18-year-old
            rules on the issue, its executive body wants to simplify the
            system so companies deal with only one regulator in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Strong commitment to privacy is a key differentiator for
            Microsoft so we'll always carefully review any feedback we
            receive,' Robin Koch, a spokesman for Microsoft, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The group of EU data watchdogs wrote to Google Chief
            Executive Officer Larry Page a year ago, saying the company
            'empowers itself to collect vast amounts of personal data about
            Internet users' without demonstrating that this 'collection
            was proportionate,' and asking the company to bring its policy
            in line with EU rules. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), in its first product
            introduction since agreeing to sell its handset business to
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), showed a tablet and smartphones that give a
            glimpse of how the merged businesses will try to revive demand. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Lumia 2520, Nokia's first tablet, runs Microsoft's
            Windows RT 8.1 software and has a 10.1-inch display. It costs
            $499 before taxes and carrier subsidies and will start selling
            this quarter, initially in the U.K., Finland and the U.S. by
            carriers including ATT Inc. (T) Nokia also showed two smartphones
            with six-inch screens, a category often dubbed phablets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The products expand the Windows mobile-device lineup and
            signal the type of features that Microsoft will bet on in its
            hardware push after its first products failed to win over users.
            Its $7.2 billion deal for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia's devices
            unit, set to be completed next quarter, are part of the
            company's plan to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics
            Co.'s dominance of the tablet and smartphone markets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We talk a lot about Lumia and Nokia and Microsoft talks
            about Microsoft and Windows Phone. As we market our products you
            get a cacophony of different brands,' Stephen Elop, head of the

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said Bill Gates's focus on
            philanthropy makes it impossible that the Microsoft Corp. co-founder will return to the company as chief
            executive officer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The chances of that are zero,' Buffett told Bloomberg Television's
            Betty Liu in an interview today. 'He is doing exactly what he wants to do in life, and he's doing it well
            and it takes his full-time energy.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is searching for a new CEO after Steve
            Ballmer said he would step down from the world's largest software maker. Gates, 57, is chairman of Microsoft
            and serves on the board of Berkshire. In 2006, Buffett committed a majority of his wealth to the foundation
            run by Gates and his wife, Melinda. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gates is 'flying around the world a very significant
            percentage of the time, and he is engaging governments in his efforts,' said Buffett, 83. 'He has got more
            than a full-time job at the Gates Foundation, and obviously cares about Microsoft, but he's not going back.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buffett appeared today alongside his son and grandson, both named Howard, to promote a
            new book, '40 Chances: Finding Hope in a Hungry World.' The text describes lessons the billionaire's son
            learned from his years working to improve food security around the world. The elder Buffett has also given
            funds to foundations overseen by his three children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. reported first-quarter sales and profit that exceeded analysts' projections as the
            company, which is looking for a replacement for Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, relied on corporate
            software demand to make up for weak consumer personal-computer purchases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Net income in

            a year earlier, Microsoft said today in a statement. Sales climbed 16 percent to $18.5 billion. Analysts on
            average had predicted profit of 54 cents on $17.8 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by
            Bloomberg. The shares jumped in late trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker is
            undergoing unprecedented changes, conducting its first-ever CEO search and starting an organizational
            overhaul aimed at bolstering sales by focusing on devices and services. Demand for Microsoft's Office
            productivity software has helped compensate for declining consumer purchases of PCs running Windows, and the
            company has been cutting costs to shore up profit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Business has been driving the
            train,' said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York, who recommends holding the shares.

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is weathering slumping personal-computer sales by focusing on Xboxes,
            business software and cloud services, as departing Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer seeks to make the
            company less dependent on its Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft reported fiscal
            first-quarter sales and profit yesterday that topped analysts' average estimates on demand for Office
            programs and database servers. The company's revenue forecast for the current quarter was also ahead of
            projections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker is undergoing unprecedented changes,
            conducting its first-ever CEO search and starting an organizational overhaul aimed at bolstering sales by
            focusing on devices and services. Companies are snapping up products such as Web-based cloud services and
            the Lync instant messaging and voice software, bolstering sales even as consumers purchase fewer PCs running
            Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's good revenue growth, but the question going forward with these new
            initiatives is, will they generate the billion-dollar numbers we need to drive the top line number and to
            say Microsoft is really invigorated,' said Daniel Morgan, a fund manager at Synovus Trust Co. in Atlanta,
            which owns Microsoft shares. &lt;/p&gt;

            First-quarter sales from devices and consumer hardware, including Surface tablets and Xbox game consoles,
            increased 37 percent to $1.49 billion, more than the $1.14 billion average estimate. Close

        <headline>BYD Leads Gains by Nokia's Asian Suppliers After Microsoft Offer</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;BYD Electronic International Co. (285) and
            Compal Communications Inc. (8078) led gains of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s Asian
            suppliers after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) offered to pay 5.44 billion
            euros ($7.2 billion) for the Finnish company's handset business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;BYD, which supplies keypads and casings to Nokia, surged
            7.5 percent in Hong Kong to HK$3.71 as of 1:55 p.m. local time,
            headed for the biggest one-day gain since June 26. Compal
            Communications, which provides Nokia with design and assembly
            services, closed 6.9 percent higher in Taipei, its biggest gain
            since July 11. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia's devices
            unit and 1.65 billion euros for patents, the companies said in a
            statement today. Nokia is coping with cash-flow challenges as
            its phones lose market share to handsets from Apple Inc. and
            manufacturers using Google Inc.'s Android operating system. The
            Espoo, Finland-based company has lost more than 5 billion euros
            in nine quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia had the largest share of the handset market until it
            was overtaken by Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) in 2012, according to
            data compiled by Bloomberg. Samsung Electronics fell as much as
            1.9 percent while LG Electronics (066570) dropped as much as 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Other Asian suppliers to Nokia that rose include FIH Mobile
            Ltd., which climbed as much as 6.8 percent. Compeq Manufacturing
            Co. (2313) gained as much as 4.4 percent and Catcher Technology Co. (2474)
            increased as much as 4.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Today marks a moment of reinvention,' Microsoft Chief
            Executive Officer Steve Ballmer and Nokia Chief Executive
            Officer Stephen Elop said in joint blog post. 'With the
            commitment and resources of Microsoft to take Nokia's devices
            and services forward, we can now realize the full potential of
            the Windows ecosystem, providing the most compelling experiences
            for people at home, at work and everywhere in between.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The devices and services business generated about 50
            percent of Nokia's net sales during 2012, worth an estimated 15
            billion euros, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft's Ill-Starred Nordic Adventures</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Almost 14 years ago, Microsoft announced a major joint venture with a global leader in mobile
            communications, a company headquartered in a small Nordic country. The goal, according to Chief Executive
            Officer Steve Ballmer, was to get all 30 million users of Microsoft's e-mail platform to use the company's
            software on their mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The partner company was called Ericsson, and it was a
            major producer of mobile handsets. My first mobile phone, bought in Russia in 1998, was an Ericsson. It had
            a 3-inch antenna, and it did not fit in my jeans pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson Microsoft Mobile Venture
            AB fell apart in 2001. Microsoft never even paid for its 30 percent stake. Having tried working with
            Microsoft, Ericsson elected instead to team up with Sony to make mobile phones that looked more like
            consumer products than like telecommunications devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, that partnership, too,
            came to an end, with Sony buying Ericsson out for $1.5 billion. The partnership had garnered only a 5
            percent share of the global smartphone market, in part because its phones ran Symbian and Windows Mobile,
            both dead-end systems that lost out to Apple's iOS and Google's Android. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before
            Ericsson sold its share in the business, Sony Ericsson moved to Android. In the 2013 financial year, Sony
            Mobile -- the renamed former joint venture -- was still losing money but hoping, after some serous
            cost-cutting, that its Xperia range would carry it into the black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ericsson, for its part,
            has never regretted moving away from handsets to concentrate on mobile network equipment. It boasts that 40
            percent of the world's mobile traffic runs through networks that it supplied. In 2012, it made a profit of
            almost $900 million. The consumer business is forgotten like a bad dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By selling its
            mobile phone business to Microsoft, another Nordic company, Nokia, is following in Ericsson's footsteps.
            There is little doubt that the Finns can repeat their Swedish neighbors' success. Nokia recently bought
            Germany's Siemens out of their joint venture, Nokia Siemens Networks, another global leader in network
            equipment, focusing on mobile broadband. The business lost money last year, but only because of large
            restructuring charges. In the second quarter of 2013, it showed a profit of about $10 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
            terms of importance to Nokia, the infrastructure business, with 2012 sales of $18.2 billion, comes a close
            second to handsets, which generated $20.7 billion. The phone division, however, lost almost $1.5 billion
            last year. Along with the growing but risky smartphone business, Microsoft has bought the Finnish company's
            rapidly deteriorating line of "feature phones" -- cheap outdated devices with actual buttons. Last year, the
            unit sales of these Nokia phones decreased 20 percent compared to 2011, and the decline continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's
            role is similar to that of Sony's in the Ericsson deal, except it is paying almost five times as much for a
            smaller, 3.3 percent share of the smartphone market. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, who once worked for Microsoft
            and will return to the Redmond company to run the new mobile phone division, has done a great job for the
            Finnish company's shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Sony, Microsoft is not a consumer-products
            company. It has been most successful selling its products to businesses, from computer manufacturers to
            corporate clients buying licenses for Microsoft Office software. Instead of betting on the most successful
            operating system, Android, it is intent on pushing its own Windows Phone, ignored by many application
            developers because of its tiny market share. Ballmer has locked his successor into a money-losing business
            with a headcount of more than 32,000 people, operating in a highly competitive market where Microsoft is the
            underdog. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Nokia, it can breathe a sigh of relief. Gone are the (recent) days when
            its sales equaled 20 percent of Finland's gross domestic product. Also gone are the losses, offloaded on
            Microsoft with its $70 billion in cash. Let he who can afford it play the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Leonid

        <headline>Microsoft to Buy Nokia's Devices Unit for $7.2 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is spending 5.44 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s
            handset unit so it can gain ground on Apple Inc. and Google (GOOG) Inc. in a smartphone market it let get
            away -- gaining a possible new chief executive officer in the process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia's devices
            and services unit, which accounted for half of the company's 2012 revenue, along with 32,000 employees, will
            transfer to Microsoft, the companies said. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, 49, will return to Microsoft after a
            three-year stint running the Finnish manufacturer. The move stoked speculation he may be a successor to CEO
            Steve Ballmer, who said last month he'd retire within 12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is deepening
            a push into hardware as dwindling computer sales sap demand for the programs that made it the world's
            largest software maker. Nokia shares jumped as much as 48 percent in Helsinki as the sale removes a
            money-losing handset business and lets it focus on higher-margin networking gear. Even combined, the
            companies have less than 4 percent of the smartphone market, leaving them far behind Apple and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The question is whether combining two weak companies will get you a strong new competitor -- it's
            doubtful,' said Paul Budde, a telecommunications consultant in Sydney. 'Both Nokia and Microsoft really
            missed the boat in terms of smartphones, and it is extremely difficult to claw your way back from that.'
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Market-Share Decline &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland, racked up
            losses of more than 5 billion euros over nine quarters as Elop's comeback efforts failed to eat into the
            dominance of Apple (AAPL) and Google's Android platform in the smartphone market. The stock has lost more
            than 80 percent in the five years through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shares rose 34 percent to 3.97
            euros in Helsinki, valuing Nokia at 14.9 billion euros. The shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
            fell 4.6 percent to $31.88 at the close in New York, wiping out more than $12.6 billion in market value. The
            company's market capitalization is now about $265.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement,
            Microsoft will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia's devices division and 1.65 billion euros for patents,
            according to a statement from the companies. The all-cash transaction, subject to Nokia investors' approval,
            is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. JPMorgan Chase Co. advised Nokia on the
            transaction, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. worked with Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;'Big Transformation'
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia said it will book a gain of 3.2 billion euros, with the sale 'significantly'
            accretive to earnings. It also said it aims to return its debt, which is ranked junk by all three major
            rating companies, to an investment grade. Chairman Risto Siilasmaa, who will become Nokia's interim CEO,
            said the company may return excess capital to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a big transformation,
            but that's what you've got to do in the tech business to move forward,' Ballmer told Tom Keene on Bloomberg
            Television's 'The Pulse.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it is confident of getting the deal approved by
            early next year. The transaction will shave 12 cents a share off earnings in the current fiscal year, or 8
            cents excluding some items, the company said. In 2015, the cost will be 6 cents based on generally accepted
            accounting principles. Excluding some costs, the deal will add to profit that year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft
            also expects to get more profit for every device sold -- more than $40 a unit for smartphones, compared with
            the less than $10 in gross profit it currently gets for Windows Phone sold by Nokia. That doesn't include
            the costs of marketing and development, though. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cost Savings &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based
            on generally accepted accounting principles, the transaction will add to earnings in fiscal 2016, Microsoft
            said. The company expects to have annual cost savings of $600 million 18 months after the deal closes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Microsoft purchase was the second major deal to be announced during the U.S. Labor Day holiday
            yesterday. Verizon Communications Inc. agreed to pay $130 billion for Vodafone Group Plc's stake in their
            U.S. wireless venture in the biggest transaction in more than a decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The
            Microsoft-Nokia deal is the largest for a wireless device maker after Google's purchase of Motorola's
            handset unit in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Microsoft, the deal including the payment
            to license Nokia's patents is its second-biggest behind the $8.5 billion purchase of Internet telephone
            company Skype in 2011. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Motorola Comparison &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed to pay
            about 0.35 times annual revenue, compared with the median of about 1.4 times for 60 wireless equipment-maker
            deals tracked by Bloomberg. That also compares with the 0.77 times revenue Google paid for Motorola
            Mobility, the data show. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google paid about 1.3 times annual operating income for the
            handset maker, while Nokia's device and services business reported an operating loss last year, according to
            the data. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the latest sale, the original pioneers in the mobile-phone industry --
            Motorola, Nokia and Ericsson AB -- have all ceased to be independent handset manufacturers or given up on
            the business. BlackBerry Ltd. said last month it's considering putting itself up for sale. Its shares
            advanced less than 1 percent to $10.21 in today's trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, meanwhile, becomes
            the last major developer of smartphone operating systems to get into manufacturing. Apple makes its own
            handsets, which use its iOS operating system. Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility gave it its own
            lineup of phones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Surface Tablet &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's other recent
            significant move into hardware -- the Surface tablet -- has trailed expectations and the company wrote down
            inventory last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To break even on an operating basis, Microsoft will need Nokia
            to sell about 50 million smartphones a year, it said in a presentation. Nokia has a run-rate of about 30
            million units. In the second quarter, Nokia sold 7.4 million smartphones under the Lumia line. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft acquired the Lumia brand to use with smartphones, while it will license the Nokia brand
            to use with low-end phones for 10 years, Elop said at a press briefing today. Microsoft will later decide
            what to call its future smartphones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will face a balancing act owning Nokia
            and keeping its other hardware partners, including HTC Corp. (2498) and Samsung Electronics Co., committed
            to its Windows Phone. Aiming to reassure other phone makers that Microsoft will still support them, Ballmer
            said that the company was '100 percent' committed to helping its manufacturing partners. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer
            declined to say whether Elop would become CEO, or had been a candidate to succeed him. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Microsoft
            Tie-Up &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer called Nokia's Siilasmaa shortly after the new year to initiate
            discussions on an acquisition and the two met in February at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona,
            according to Microsoft. Talks heated up in recent months and a deal was lined up before Ballmer announced
            his retirement last month, the company said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Nokia have had a close
            relationship through Elop, who had run Microsoft's Office unit. He left the software maker in September 2010
            to take the top job at Nokia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, Elop likened Nokia's position to a man
            standing on a burning oil platform on the verge of being engulfed in flames, facing the option of staying
            aboard or jumping to the ocean to have a chance to survive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February 2011, Elop
            struck a deal with Ballmer to switch Nokia's smartphones from its own Symbian operating system to Windows
            Phone. In exchange, Microsoft ponied up more than $1 billion to pay for Nokia marketing and developing
            products on Windows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Losing Share &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia had the largest share of
            the mobile phone handset market until it was overtaken by Samsung (005930) in 2012, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Nokia remains a top seller of traditional mobile phones --
            models that are more popular in developing markets. In total shipments, the company ranks second to Samsung
            among device manufacturers. Samsung accounted for 26 percent of shipments last quarter, while Nokia had 14
            percent. Apple came in third with 7.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the sale to Microsoft, Nokia's
            biggest business will be network equipment, which it recently fully took over from Siemens AG (SIE) and
            renamed Nokia Solutions and Networks. The unit competes with Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent as well as China's
            Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. (763) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ericsson jumped 5 percent to 82.50 kronor in
            Stockholm. Alcatel-Lucent, which under new CEO Michel Combes is streamlining its business, added 9.2 percent
            to 2.20 euros in Paris trading. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mapping Unit &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia said it will
            also keep its mapping and location services unit, called Here, and its technology development and licensing
            division. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Nokia has a highly evolved device design and manufacturing process which will
            benefit Microsoft greatly,' said Al Hilwa, an analyst at research firm IDC. 'This is simply the fastest path
            in front of Microsoft to achieve something like Apple's vision on devices.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

            &lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring against losses
            on Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) debt fell by a record after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed
            to buy its handset business and license its patents for 5.44
            billion euros ($7.2 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Nokia dropped 330 basis points to
            199, according to data provider CMA at 10 a.m. in London. The
            Espoo, Finland-based company's 6.75 percent bonds due February
            2019 jumped 7.5 cents on the euro to 113.3 cents, the highest
            since June 2011, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia is exiting the mobile-phone business it once
            dominated after struggling to compete with Apple Inc.'s iPhone
            and Google Inc.'s Android platform. The deal -- the largest for
            a wireless device maker after Google's purchase of Motorola's
            handset unit completed in May 2012 -- will let the company focus
            on its network equipment business, which is facing intensifying
            competition from Sweden's Ericsson AB and China's Huawei
            Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Whilst the loss of the handset business marks the end of
            an era for the company, it could no longer continue to develop
            new phones as its market share plunged,' said Aengus McMahon, a
            London-based analyst at ING Groep NV. 'This move is positive
            for Nokia spreads and we would expect to see some positive
            momentum in its ratings as the transaction moves towards
            completion.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Nokia Ratings &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia is rated B1 by Moody's Investors Service, four levels
            below investment grade, and the New York-based ratings firm has
            a negative outlook on the company's debt. Nokia's plan to regain
            a high-grade ranking will be plausible after the Microsoft deal
            is completed, according to report from Mizuho International Plc
            today. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 62 percent decline in the cost of Nokia's swaps is the
            most since CMA began collecting data in 2007 and the contracts
            are the lowest since June 2011. They're down from a peak of more
            than 1,200 basis points in July 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Swaps on Microsoft were unchanged at 33 basis points, CMA
            data show. The world's largest software maker is moving into
            hardware as it also tries to remain competitive. Its 550 million
            euros of 2.625 percent bonds due May 2033 fell 0.26 cents on the
            euro to 91.08 cents, the lowest since they were issued in April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
            million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
            to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
            exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
            should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements and an
            increase signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Raced to $7.2 Billion Deal With Soul-Searching</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s agreement to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset business, codenamed Project
            Gold Medal, was more of a sprint than a marathon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talks between the two companies began
            in February after both sides agreed a two-year-old collaboration on smartphone development wasn't working,
            according to people familiar with the deal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By July, Microsoft and Nokia, based near
            Helsinki, settled on the price and structure of a 5.44 billion euro ($7.2 billion) deal to buy the handset
            business and license its patents, the people said. In contrast, Vodafone Group Plc's announced sale on Sept.
            2 of its 45 percent stake in U.S. mobile company Verizon Wireless for $130 billion followed years of talks
            with Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nokia's codename in the talks was Nurmi, named
            after Paavo Johannes Nurmi, the nine-time gold medal runner known as the 'the Flying Finn.' Microsoft was
            dubbed Edwin Moses, for the American track-and-field athlete who won two gold medals in the hurdles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia's board met more than 50 times to deliberate on a sale, a process described as a
            soul-searching exercise by the people, who asked not to be identified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Timed to follow
            last month's announcement that Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer would retire, the Nokia deal
            is intended to set up the U.S. company for a renewed assault on the smartphone and tablet markets, the
            people said. Once the world's most dominant technology firm, Microsoft under Ballmer has lagged behind
            Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. in fast-growing mobile devices, amid contraction in the personal-computer
            market it helped invent. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY), the struggling
            Canadian smartphone maker weighing a sale, jumped in early U.S.
            trading after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) agreed to acquire Nokia Oyj's
            handset business in a $7.2 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares advanced 3.3 percent to $10.45 at 7:52 a.m. New
            York time. They have fallen 6.1 percent since Aug. 12, when
            BlackBerry announced it was weighing a sale, and are down 15
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A BlackBerry board committee began exploring a sale of the
            Waterloo, Ontario-based company last month while also studying
            partnerships to rescue it from a three-year sales slide that has
            slashed its market value by about 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft agreed to buy BlackBerry rival Nokia's handset
            business and license its patents, casting together the lot of
            two technology companies trying to stay relevant against more
            fleet-footed rivals. Both Nokia and BlackBerry have lost market
            share to Apple Inc. and devices running Google Inc.'s Android
            software. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;No matter who wins in one U.S. House
            district in Washington state in November, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) can't
            lose. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Democrat Suzan DelBene, the first-term incumbent in the
            seat that includes Microsoft's headquarters, is a former
            executive in the company's mobile-phone division. Pedro Celis,
            the Republican challenger, worked there as a distinguished
            engineer, a title used for top technical talent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Their campaigns echo each other, touting their Microsoft
            experience to say they'd be the best fit for the tech-heavy 1st
            District north of Seattle, while raking in tens of thousands of
            dollars in donations from current and former workers for the
            world's largest computer software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A campaign between company alumni 'would seem to be a
            pretty good deal for Microsoft,' said Travis Ridout, a
            professor at Washington State University who studies campaigns
            and elections. 'I can't see how that's a bad thing.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It's unusual, too. While many companies have friends in
            high places, few members of Congress represent their former
            employer's headquarters. That will be key for Microsoft as
            Congress debates limits on using technology for spying, patent
            legislation, tax-law changes and whether to expand immigration
            visas for high-tech workers -- all issues Microsoft has lobbied
            on during the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nokia Junk Seen in High-Grade Ascent With Microsoft Cash</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;By selling its money-losing mobile-phone business to Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for $7.2 billion, Nokia
            Oyj (NOK1V) is
            now on the cusp of earning an investment-grade rating from the
            bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company's $1 billion of 5.375 percent debt due in May
            2019 jumped to a three-year high of 102.9 cents after Nokia said
            Microsoft agreed to pay 5.44 billion euros for its handset unit.
            That caused the yield on the junk-rated bonds to fall to 4.79
            percent, just 0.25 percentage point more than the average for
            similar-maturity debt with the lowest investment grade of BBB-,
            according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia, founded as a pulp and paper maker almost 150 years
            ago, is now exiting the mobile-phone business it once dominated
            after losing customers to Apple Inc.'s iPhone and Google Inc.'s
            Android system. With the disposal, the Espoo, Finland-based
            company will now focus on turning around its network-equipment
            business after gaining full control from Siemens AG last month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They certainly have it within their control to go to
            investment grade,' said Sam Morton, a credit analyst at Mizuho
            International Plc in London. 'People were worried that cash
            burn in the handset unit would eventually erode Nokia's net cash
            position. Disposal of this cash-burning entity has alleviated
            those concerns.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Sets Xbox One Release as Sony Faceoff Awaits</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) plans to release the
            Xbox One video-game console on Nov. 22, a week before Black
            Friday, and said it increased the number of units available for
            its holiday faceoff against Sony (6758) Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consumer demand spurred Microsoft to speed production after
            retailers sold out of pre-order allotments, said Yusuf Mehdi,
            chief marketing officer for the Redmond, Washington-based
            software maker's interactive entertainment division. Sales this
            year will top the debut of the current Xbox 360, he said,
            declining to discuss specifics. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're building more consoles for day one and for the
            holidays than we've ever done,' Mehdi said in a telephone
            interview. 'It is on track to be the biggest launch by a wide
            margin, much bigger than what we did for Xbox 360.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Sony are betting that faster machines
            allowing for features such as motion capture and immersive
            graphics will entice consumers whose tastes are shifting toward
            mobile games played on tablets and smartphones. Microsoft, which
            is buying Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit, is stregthening a push into
            hardware as demand weakens for programs such as Windows that
            made it the world's largest software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has increased the speed of the Xbox One's
            central processing unit to 1.75 GHz, 10 percent more than
            previously targeted, Mehdi said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'You are now able to have even better fidelity of the
            games,' Mehdi said. 'The system itself will work much
            faster.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Console Prices &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Retailers began taking orders for the $499 Xbox One and
            Sony's coming PlayStation 4 in June. Last month, Grapevine,
            Texas-based GameStop Corp. (GME) raised its profit forecast, citing
            strength in console orders. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the top U.S. seller of consoles for more than
            two years, will debut the Xbox One a week later than the $399
            PS4, which hits American stores on Nov. 15. Nintendo Co. (7974) last
            week cut the price of the Wii U by $50 to $299. The console,
            introduced last year, has missed company sales targets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is the
            traditional start to the shopping season in the U.S., with
            retailers offering discounts to draw customers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will release the Xbox One in 13 countries all on
            the same day, giving it a week's head start in Europe, where the
            PS4 starts selling on Nov. 29. Sony will reach stores in 32
            markets this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which initially targeted 21 countries for its
            debut, last month cut the number to 13 to ensure larger markets
            have sufficient supplies. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;NFL Highlights &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los
            Angeles, expects Sony to sell 3 million consoles this year and
            12 million in 2014, compared with 2.5 million and 10 million,
            respectively, for Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 4.6 percent to $31.88 yesterday in New York,
            after announcing that it's spending 5.44 billion euros ($7.2
            billion) to buy Nokia's devices and services unit. The shares
            have climbed 19 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Xbox One is an attempt to merge television watching with
            video game playing, Mehdi said. Microsoft has teamed with
            partners including the National Football League to offer
            features such as viewing highlights and game scores. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has no plans to offer pay-TV channels in
            competition with established providers, nor to spin off the
            video-game unit, Mehdi said. Xbox One is part of a companywide
            strategy to offer multiple devices to consumers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That strategy was underscored by the acquisition Nokia's
            handset business. The unit accounted for more than half of the
            revenue for the Espoo, Finland-based company, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We know we live in a multi-device world,' Mehdi said.
            'The people between 18 and 30 -- 80 percent of them are looking
            at a phone or tablet while watching TV.' &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer isn't letting his departure plans
            stand in the way of a complete overhaul of the software-centric strategy he spent decades putting in place.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even after saying last month he will retire from Microsoft within the next year, Ballmer
            is accelerating the company's move into hardware with a $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset
            unit yesterday. That's an area the Redmond, Washington-based company waded into in the past 18 months,
            including last year's introduction of the Surface tablet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now the company, which built a
            dominant position in personal-computing operating systems by focusing on software and relying on multiple
            partners to offer hardware, is diving into its own smartphone line, a low-end handset business and
            manufacturing operations. With rivals like Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) leading in mobile,
            Microsoft executives said the company had few options except to break from its software past. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We were in software exclusively and that was a logical thing to do for a long period of time, but
            the reality today is that's no longer possible,' Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an
            interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer had no choice, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner Inc.
            Even combined with Nokia, Microsoft has less than a 4 percent share in smartphones and is running out of
            time to carve out a piece of a market ruled by Google's Android and Apple's iOS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Urgent
            Change &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;'There must be a sense of urgency that Microsoft feels about how much longer it
            will take them to make it in mobile and they need to make it in mobile,' Milanesi said. 'There is a sense
            that they have to move faster than they have been and the only way they can do that is by integrating the
            hardware and software.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within Microsoft's headquarters, Ballmer realized last year that
            the company needed to dump its traditional playbook and make its own phones, said a person familiar with the
            matter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, Microsoft's Windows Phones were still at a percentage in the low
            single digits. It became clear that the company couldn't gain on competitors or turn phones into a
            significant moneymaker if Microsoft only made the operating system, said the person, who asked not to be
            identified because the talks were private. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Six Weeks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon Ballmer
            was on the phone with Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa, resulting in a meeting in February at the Mobile World
            Congress show, said the person. Various forms of a deal were rejected by both boards and talks seemed dead
            in June before being revived about six weeks ago, the person said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter Wootton, a
            spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment on specifics of the talks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the deal,
            Microsoft becomes the last major developer of smartphone operating systems to get into phone hardware. Apple
            makes its own handsets that use its iOS operating system. Google acquired Motorola Mobility last year for
            about $12.4 billion, giving the company its own lineup of phones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Phones are the most
            personal of the personal devices people use today and success in phones is important for success in tablets
            and PCs,' Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said in an interview. 'We need to move faster.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer helped Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates formulate much of the strategy that led the company
            to dominate PC operating systems in the 1990s. As Microsoft's first business manager, Ballmer negotiated
            some of the company's initial deals to put its software on partners' computers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Strategy
            Shift &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The formula: focus on software that supports a multitude of devices, give
            customers choice, hone in on the part of the market that has very high margins and leave the low-margin
            hardware to others. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has developed Xbox game consoles since 2001 and took that
            on because partners weren't interested. Elsewhere it hewed to the strategy -- it avoided making its own
            music player, for example, until it was too late to catch Apple's iPod. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has
            increasingly deviated from the formula in recent months. In October 2012, it started selling the Surface
            tablet. That same month, Ballmer wrote a shareholder letter announcing a new strategy focused on devices and
            services. In July, he instituted the biggest reorganization in more than a decade to align divisions around
            his vision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's a big transformation, but that's kind of what you need to do in the
            technology world to move forward,' Ballmer told Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television's 'The Pulse.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Trickier Partnerships &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't completely changing its stripes, and it
            will still license its Windows Phone software to other handset makers. Yet that will be trickier because
            Microsoft now has to reassure hardware partners that it isn't putting Nokia devices ahead of their products.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, head of Microsoft's operating systems, this week authored a blog post
            claiming the deal would benefit all Windows Phone partners. He ended with a lyric from the rock band The
            Killers: 'I don't shine if you don't shine.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The move to devices and services means a
            change for Microsoft's margins. Internet-based services and hardware are costlier to deliver than software,
            and margins will decline, Hood said. Microsoft will still be able to increase revenue and profit by selling
            more, even at a lower margin, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Reaction &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For
            phones specifically, Microsoft's traditional strategy of working with equipment manufacturers wasn't very
            profitable, Hood said. The phone unit had to fork over more than $1 billion to Nokia as part of a 2011 deal
            that got the Finnish phone maker to use the software. Hood said the Windows Phone business will end up with
            higher operating income once Nokia is integrated than it had without the hardware business. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither
            the prospective margins nor Microsoft's further entrenchment in consumer hardware thrilled shareholders,
            some of whom favor a focus on business software. The company's shares fell 4.6 percent yesterday to close at
            $31.88. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is 'not good for investors that were hoping the company would narrow their
            focus to the enterprise,' said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker Capital
            Management Inc., which oversees $2.6 billion including Microsoft shares. 'Why not let the next CEO make this
            call?' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal is also serving to jolt investors who read Ballmer's retirement as a
            sign Microsoft would reverse course on its devices strategy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Anyone who thought that
            would be put on hold while a new CEO was sought has to accept that now,' said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at
            Loomis Sayles Co. in Boston. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Google-Motorola Deal Foreshadows Challenge Awaiting Microsoft</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;If Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Motorola Mobility
            deal is anything to go by, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) investors will need
            to brace for diminished profitability now that it has agreed to
            purchase Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The profit margin at Google has shrunk by more than 7
            percentage points since the search provider purchased the
            struggling hardware unit in May of 2012, according to data
            compiled by Bloomberg. The Motorola business posted an operating
            loss equal to 34 percent of sales in the most recent quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google's experience with Motorola may hold lessons for
            Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, which announced
            plans on Sept. 2 to buy Nokia's handset unit, stepping up an
            effort to challenge Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google in the smartphone
            market. Nokia's devices and services business swung to a loss of
            more than $1.4 billion after earning almost that much in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Hardware margins are always much lower than software,'
            said Sameet Sinha, an analyst with B. Riley Co in San
            Francisco. 'Microsoft will have to bear the brunt. You will see
            margin compression. There's no doubt about it.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, spent $12.4
            billion on Motorola Mobility last year to expand into the
            mobile-hardware business after 14 years in which Web advertising
            accounted for almost all of its revenue. The purchase also gave
            Google a trove of about 17,000 patents to protect Android
            devices in legal disputes with competitors. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Getty Images Sues to Block Microsoft's Bing Image Widget</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Getty Images Inc. sued Microsoft
            Corp. (MSFT) over claims its Bing Image Widget, an application that
            allows Web designers to add collages and slideshows, violates
            Getty's copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Getty, the Carlyle Group LP-controlled photo archive, said
            in a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court today that the
            Bing tool displays images without permission from copyright
            owners including, in many instances, Getty. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Rather than draw from a licensed collection of images,
            Microsoft 'gathers these images by crawling as much of the
            Internet as it can, copying and indexing every image it finds,
            without regard to the copyright status of the images and without
            permission from copyright owners,' according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The suit, which says Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
            released the Bing Image Widget service in August, seeks a court
            order blocking the company from its collection of images and
            unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Peter Wooton, a Microsoft spokesman, didn't immediately
            return an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Getty Images Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 14-cv-7114, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York

            &lt;p&gt;Before Apple's event on Tuesday sucks all the air out of tech coverage (and it's already getting
            difficult to breathe), several of the company's smartphone rivals this week did their best not to be
            forgotten amid the increasing iHoopla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the announcements, which were made at IFA,
            the big consumer electronics show in Berlin:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Samsung&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung
            Electronics, Apple's biggest competitor, unveiled the Note Edge, a smartphone with a display that curves
            down one side so users can read messages, news and stock tickers from an angle. If that feature is
            well-received by consumers, one analyst said Samsung could apply that screen technology to its new Galaxy
            phone next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samsung also showed off the Note 4, which comes with a higher-definition
            screen, microphones that allow for cleaner recordings, and a feature that celebrities may want to be careful
            with: the ability to snap group selfies with a 120-degree view. The Note 4 goes on sale next month, while
            the Note Edge will be available later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Note line, with its larger screens,
            will be under pressure next week when Apple is expected to push into the "phablet" category. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
            South Korean company also displayed a virtual-reality headset, developed with Facebook's Oculus unit, as
            well as a new 2-inch Gear S wristwatch with a curved display and built-in network connectivity for calls and
            text messages. Apple's wearable device, often referred to as the iWatch, may not come out until next year,
            according to a report from Recode. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Shows First Lumia Phones Since Nokia Unit Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) announced the Lumia
            830, its first high-end smartphone since it bought Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s
            devices unit for about 5.4 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in
            April. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The device has a 5-inch display and a 10-megapixel camera,
            will cost about 330 euros before taxes and subsidies and starts
            shipping this month, the software giant said today at the annual
            IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin. Microsoft also showed
            the Lumia 730 and Lumia 735, which will cost 199 euros and 219
            euros, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're bringing those flagship experiences to a more
            affordable price segment,' Chris Weber, head of mobile devices
            sales at Microsoft, said at the conference. 'Apple can't say
            that and Samsung can't say that.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is
            struggling to boost the market share of Windows Phone, which was
            2.5 percent in the second quarter. Consumers are opting for
            devices made by Apple Inc. or powered by Google Inc.'s Android
            software, which together represent 96 percent of smartphones,
            according to data from IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft in July announced the biggest job cuts in its
            history, planning to slash 18,000 positions as the company
            integrates Nokia's handset unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares have jumped 13 percent since the purchase
            was completed on April 25, giving the Redmond, Washington-based
            company a market value of $370 billion. Microsoft shares traded
            at the equivalent of $45.03 at 1:27 p.m. in Frankfurt, compared
            with the $44.96 close in New York yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics Co. yesterday unveiled two new
            smartphones and showed off a virtual-reality headset, developed
            with Facebook Inc.'s Oculus unit, and a new smartwatch. Apple is

        <headline>Microsoft Out $18 Billion on Ballmer Nokia Deal: Real M&amp;amp;A</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s $7.2 billion takeover of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset business cost
            shareholders more than twice that as it dashed hopes for a fresh start under Steve Ballmer's successor. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company lost $18 billion in market value since the purchase of Nokia's
            mobile-phone assets was disclosed, erasing all of the gains that followed the announcement last month that
            Ballmer is retiring, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The agreement cements the departing chief
            executive officer's shift toward the more volatile consumer-device business and leaves little room for his
            successor to take a different tack, Atlantic Equities LLP said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is chasing
            growth in a market already dominated by Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) with devices that generate
            lower returns than the company's business-software division. Nokia CEO Stephen Elop is returning to
            Microsoft as part of the asset sale, making him Ballmer's most likely successor and signaling that the
            company is in smartphones for the long haul, Sanford C. Bernstein Co. said, even as some shareholders say
            that strategy is misplaced. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I can't say I'm too thrilled about the deal,' Tim Schwartz,
            a money manager at Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Schwartz Investment Counsel Inc., which oversees $1.3
            billion and owns Microsoft, said in a phone interview. 'The perception is that this is going to be a
            continuation of the old management and old-school Microsoft mentality.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Wins Trial on Google's Patent Licensing Tactics</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)'s Motorola Mobility
            didn't act in good faith when it demanded patent royalties from
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) for use of video-compression and Wi-Fi
            technology, a federal jury said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The jury in Seattle acted in its first day of
            deliberations. Microsoft was awarded about $14.5 million in
            damages, the Seattle Times newspaper reported in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This is a landmark win for all who want products that are
            affordable and work well together,' David Howard, Microsoft
            deputy general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. 'The
            jury's verdict is the latest in a growing list of decisions by
            regulators and courts telling Google to stop abusing patents.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We're disappointed in this outcome, but look forward to
            an appeal of the new legal issues raised in this case,' William
            Moss, a Motorola Mobility spokesman, said in an e-mailed
            statement. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The verdict could help the two companies resolve a dispute
            over patent royalties for both fundamental technologies in
            electronic devices and features that make them easier to use.
            More broadly, the case is one front in a global debate on how to
            handle patents that relate to technology included in industry
            standards used by all manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft claimed that Motorola Mobility acted unreasonably
            by demanding royalties of 2.25 percent of the price of an Xbox
            video-gaming system or a computer that runs on the Windows
            operating system, and then threatening to get a court order
            halting sales of the products if the money wasn't paid. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Common Tactic &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility said the October 2010 letters sent to
            Microsoft were a common opening offer that it used in
            negotiating patent licensing with other companies for years.
            Rather than sitting down to negotiate a licensing agreement as
            other companies do, Microsoft went to the courts, Motorola
            Mobility said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which reported $73.7 billion in 2012 revenue,
            has said the royalty demand would equal more than $4 billion a
            year, a figure Motorola Mobility disputed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Robart, who presided over the
            trial, determined in April that the appropriate royalty rate was
            about a half-cent per unit for video-decoding technology and 3
            1/2 cents for wireless technology. Microsoft said that would
            equal about $1.8 million a year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The issue for the jury was whether Motorola Mobility's
            actions were in keeping with the standards of good faith and
            fair dealing. Robart, in pre-trial rulings, said Motorola
            Mobility's offers have to be made in good faith, though the
            initial offer doesn't have to be on fair terms as long as the
            result is fair. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Royalty Demand &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft struck first in 2010, demanding royalties from
            companies using Google's Android operating system and filing a
            complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission. Motorola
            Mobility responded within weeks by sending a letter saying it
            was owed royalties on the Xbox and Windows. The company then
            filed its own infringement lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, won a ruling that
            limits imports of Motorola Mobility phones that have a feature
            to synchronize calendars with computers. It sued U.S. Customs
            and Border Protection for letting the phones continue to enter
            the U.S., and both companies are appealing aspects of the case
            to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
            Washington, D.C. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;$293.9 Billion Market &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The patent fights are part of a global war for an increased
            share of the $293.9 billion smartphone market. They've become a
            testing ground to determine how to treat patents that cover
            basic technology used by companies so that, for instance,
            chargers can plug into any device or Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s iPhone can
            send and receive images from Samsung Electronics Co.'s Galaxy S4
            handset. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Companies that participate in groups to establish
            industrywide standards pledge to license any relevant patents on
            'fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory' terms. In return,
            they have the advantage of ensuring their technology is widely
            used, giving them a leg up on implementing the standard and
            establishing a broad base of potential licensees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A patent gives its owner the power to block others from
            using the invention. Microsoft and Apple have both pledged not
            to exercise that power when it comes to patents on industry
            standards, though they have used other patents in their legal
            fights with competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility and Samsung, two companies with long
            histories with mobile phones, have lodged patent-infringement
            suits using their patents on fundamental phone technology, such
            as how data is transmitted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Obama Veto &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama's administration said limits should
            be placed on such patents, and on Aug. 3 vetoed an import ban on
            some of Apple's older phones that Samsung had won. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Samsung, which is under investigation by European
            regulators over its use of standard-essential patents, had
            agreed not to seek a sales ban on that continent against Apple
            for use of any such technology. Google, of Mountain View,
            California, reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade
            Commission that limits its activities regarding those patents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Robart last year precluded Motorola Mobility from halting
            sales of any Microsoft products based on an infringement finding
            in Germany. Part of Microsoft's request for damages was based on
            the cost of relocating a logistics center warehouse to the
            Netherlands from Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Sept. 11 Arguments &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which
            specializes in patent law, is scheduled to hear arguments Sept.
            11 on whether there should be different rules for standard
            essential patents, and when companies can obtain court orders to
            block the use of patented technology. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Posner, who normally presides on
            the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, threw out cases
            Apple and Motorola Mobility had filed against each other. Posner
            ruled in June 2012 that Motorola Mobility wasn't entitled to any
            ban on the use of standard-essential patents, while Apple wasn't
            entitled to halt sales of complicated electronics based on an
            infringement claim over device features. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Mobility Inc.,
            10cv1823, U.S. District Court for the Western District of
            Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is to buy 1.5
            billion euros ($2 billion) of convertible bonds from Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)

            &lt;p&gt;Nokia agreed to buy Siemens AG (SIE)'s 50 percent share in Nokia
            Siemens Networks in July for 1.7 billion euros. It raised 1.2
            billion euros of loans arranged by JPMorgan Chase Co. and

        <headline>Most Read on Bloomberg: Microsoft-Nokia, Oil, Brenneman, Hiring</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The following list comprises the
            most-read Bloomberg News reports from the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;STORIES &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Microsoft Will Buy Nokia's Handset Business for $7.2 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is spending 5.44
            billion euros ($7.2 billion) to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit so
            it can gain ground on Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in a smartphone
            market it let get away -- gaining a possible new chief executive
            officer in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Oil Advances on Syria as Stocks Rise, Treasuries Drop on
            Economy &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil and gold advanced amid
            concern America is moving closer to striking Syria, while U.S.
            stocks rose and Treasuries retreated for a second day as a
            report showed faster-than-forecast growth in manufacturing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. David Brenneman, Morgan Stanley Equity Risk Manager, Dies &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- David Brenneman, a Harvard-trained
            lawyer who crossed into finance and was an executive director in
            equity risk management at Morgan Stanley, has died. He was 37. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Jobs Gain Less Than Forecast as U.S. Workers Drop Out:
            Economy &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Payrolls in the U.S. climbed less
            than projected in August and gains for the prior two months were
            revised down, pointing to an expansion that's struggling to gain
            momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Erdoes Managing Money Since 6 Proves JPMorgan Trillions No
            Fluke &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase Co.'s Mary Callahan
            Erdoes got her first assignment managing money when she was 6
            years old. The eldest of four children, Erdoes showed an early
            aptitude for math that was fostered at her grandmother Kay's
            suburban Chicago breakfast table, where she helped balance her
            grandparents' checkbook on an adding machine. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;6. How 37-Year-Old Teacher Imperils Pimco's Bond Bet: Mexico
            Credit &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- For Pedro Hernandez, a striking
            elementary-school teacher from the southern state of Oaxaca, his
            union's protests disrupting Mexico's capital aren't just about
            education. They're about stopping President Enrique Pena Nieto. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;7. Pimco Total Return Loses 14% of Assets Amid Four-Month Rout &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The world's biggest mutual fund
            keeps getting smaller. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;8. U.S. Stocks Gain While Middle-East Shares Slump, Metals
            Decline &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 4 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks rose for a second day,
            led by chipmakers and automobile companies, and Treasuries fell
            as the Federal Reserve said the economy maintained a 'modest to
            moderate' pace of growth. Shares in the Middle East sank as the
            U.S. moved closer to a military strike against Syria. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;9. Obama Gets Boehner's Support for Military Strike on Syria &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama urged
            Congress to take a 'prompt' vote authorizing military action
            against Syria and won support from the two top House Republicans
            even as two polls found opposition from the American public. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;10. Treasuries, Gold Rise on Fed Bets as Oil Gains on Syria
            Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Treasury yields slid, the dollar
            sank and gold rose as slower-than-forecast jobs growth eased
            concern the Federal Reserve will cut stimulus. Oil jumped to the
            highest since May 2011 and U.S. stocks erased gains amid tension
            between American and Russia over Syria's civil war. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;COLUMNS &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;1. Why Not Make Everyone Rich With $50 Minimum Wage?: Caroline
            Baum &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Last week, fast-food workers staged
            a one-day strike in 60 U.S. cities to demand a minimum wage of
            $15 an hour, more than double the current federal minimum of
            $7.25. The nationwide effort, 'Fight for 15,' was organized by
            the Service Employees International Union. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Why Do We Even Care About Chemical Weapons in Syria?: Ezra
            Klein &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The United Nations estimates that
            more than 100,000 Syrians have died since the country's civil
            war began in March 2011. More die every day. But the U.S. is not
            considering military action to save them. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;3. Samsung's Galaxy Mega Is a Lumbering Giant: Rich Jaroslovsky &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- The most common reaction to
            Samsung's new Galaxy Mega smartphone may be: You've got to be
            kidding. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. Wall Street Pay Is a Model of Clarity? No Kidding: Jonathan
            Weil &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- If you want to know how much money a
            U.S. company's top five executives make, there is lots of
            information to be found. As for total employee pay? Not so much. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;5. Popular Misconceptions About Quantitative Easing: Joseph
            Gagnon &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 3 (Bloomberg) -- To combat the recession that began
            in 2007, the Federal Reserve and some other central banks have
            been buying large amounts of long-term bonds. The novelty of
            this quantitative easing makes the policy especially prone to
            popular misconceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;MULTIMEDIA &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;1. Draghi Says Confidence Indicators Confirm Better Growth &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President
            Mario Draghi speaks at a news conference in Frankfurt about the
            decision to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at a
            record low of 0.5 percent for the fourth month. (This is
            Draghi's statement only. Source: European Central Bank) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;2. Erdoes a 'Force' in Asset Management: Bloomberg Markets &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Bloomberg's Dawn Kopecki talks about
            her profile of JPMorgan Chase Co.'s asset management's chief
            executive Mary Erdoes as part of Bloomberg Markets '50 Most
            Influential' list featured in the magazine's October issue. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;3. Obama Says He Was Elected to 'End Wars, Not Start Them' &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Barack Obama speaks
            about the debate over whether military action against Syria is
            warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He spoke at a news conference at the close of the meeting
            of Group of 20 leaders in St. Petersburg, Russia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;4. World's Biggest Ship: The $185 Million Maersk Triple-E &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- On a dry-dock in South Korea Maersk
            is building the world's biggest ship. A container vessel, it
            will ply the route between Northern Europe and China. It is
            called the Triple-E and the Danish shipbuilder has ordered 20 of
            them, at a cost of $185 million each. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;5. Davis 'Seriously' Considering Run for Texas Governor &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sept. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Texas state Senator Wendy Davis, a
            Democrat, speaks about the possibility that she may run for
            governor of the state. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Agrees to Contempt to Speed E-Mail Case Appeal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), at its own request,
            was found in contempt of a court order to comply with a U.S.
            warrant for e-mails stored in a data center in Ireland, so that
            it can promptly appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan today
            granted a joint request by Microsoft and the government to hold
            the software maker in contempt. The judge imposed no further
            sanctions and said the order permits the company to immediately
            appeal her July 31 ruling that it has to produce e-mails of an
            unidentified customer sought in a drug probe. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The judge in her July ruling rejected Microsoft's argument
            that the warrant,which requires the company to provide
            investigators with the contents of the customer's MSN.com Web-based e-mail, calls for an illegal search and
            seizure outside
            the U.S. The nation in which the customer lives wasn't
            disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The government should be required to get the e-mails
            through procedures dictated by a law-enforcement treaty between
            the U.S. and Ireland, Microsoft attorney E. Joshua Rosenkranz
            argued. The Redmond, Washington-based company is the world's
            largest maker of computer software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Lawyers for both sides argued over the reach of the Stored
            Communications Act, or SCA, which allows law enforcement agents
            to obtain information through subpoenas, court orders or
            warrants, depending on the records sought. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said in a
            statement after the July hearing that the company would appeal
            promptly 'and continue to advocate that people's e-mail
            deserves strong privacy protection in the U.S. and around the
            world.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of a Warrant to Search a Certain
            E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp., 13-mj-02814, U.S. District Court, Southern
            District of New York
            (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Expands Its Xbox Music to Android, Apple Devices</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is making its Xbox
            Music service available on Android and iOS devices to compete
            with Apple (AAPL) Inc.'s iTunes, Spotify Ltd. and Pandora Media Inc. (P) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The $9.99-a-month Xbox Music Pass, which provides
            unlimited, advertising-free streaming, can be used today for the
            first time on Apple iPhones and devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)'s
            Android software, Scott Porter, principal program manager at
            XBox Music, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The expansion gives Microsoft access to the biggest
            smartphone platforms as it guns for the leaders in digital music
            -- Spotify in subscription streaming, Pandora in Web radio, and
            Apple's iTunes for purchases. Microsoft introduced the service
            in October on the Xbox 360 console and Windows 8 devices, saying
            then it planned to add Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Music needs to be something that freely connects between
            devices for users to be happy,' Porter said. Windows users
            'spent time curating and discovering new music and we need to
            give them access wherever they are.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Listeners can access Xbox Music on a smartphone, tablet,
            Xbox 360 or the coming Xbox One video game console, Porter said.
            A free, ad-supported online version allows tracks to be shared
            with people who use an Apple PC, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which is buying mobile-phone maker Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) for
            $7.2 billion, trails iOS and Android. Windows accounted for 3.6
            percent of worldwide smartphones at the end of June, according
            to Bloomberg Industries data. That compares with 79 percent for
            Android and 13 percent for Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;New Xbox Music features will be introduced when Microsoft
            starts selling Windows 8.1 in October, Porter said. One such
            addition will be a Web Playlist tool that grabs all the music on
            a Web page to create a list of songs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 1.6 percent
            to $31.66 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 18
            percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Windows Shuffle Said to Leave Leblond, DeVaan Out</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is shuffling the
            management of its Windows division, a move that will leave
            longtime executives Jon DeVaan and Antoine Leblond without
            senior leadership roles, according to people with knowledge of
            the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Terry Myerson, who runs Windows and Windows Phone, is
            reassigning executives in the newly joined software unit as part
            of Microsoft's companywide restructuring, said the people, who
            asked not to be named because the moves haven't been announced.
            Henry Sanders, a Windows Phone executive, will lead development,
            while Joe Belfiore, also from Windows Phone, will run a phone,
            tablet and PC group, said one of the people. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is
            overhauling its top ranks as Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer nears retirement. Ballmer, who said last
            month he will
            leave within a year, in July rolled out the largest change to
            the company's executive staff in more than a decade. Those
            picked as unit leaders by Ballmer are now setting up their own
            leadership teams. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Leblond had been in charge of lining up applications for
            Windows 8, Microsoft's new operating system, which was
            criticized for lacking some popular apps when it went on sale in
            October. More recently he worked on the Windows 8.1 update to
            the software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DeVaan, a 29-year Microsoft veteran, was a vice president
            in Windows development. It's not clear if the two will take on
            positions elsewhere in the company, stay in Windows, or leave
            altogeter, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Xbox Software &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Myerson, whose team also develops software for the Xbox and
            the Xbox Live online service, picked Xbox executive Marc Whitten
            to run those businesses, and Chris Jones will keep his current
            job overseeing Windows services, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Windows changes were reporter earlier by the All Things
            D blog. Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
            comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To bolster its struggling mobile business, Microsoft agreed
            last week to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset business or $7.2 billion,
            adding about 32,000 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will introduce new versions of its Surface tablet
            at an event in New York on Sept. 23, according to an invitation
            sent out by the company. While there has been speculation the
            company might introduce a smaller Surface, no such device will
            be unveiled at the event, said a person familiar with the
            matter. Last quarter Microsoft took a $900 million charge
            writedown on unsold Surface tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The new products will include both a version for Intel
            Corp. chips running Windows 8 and a version running Windows RT
            on an Nvdia Corp. chip with ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology, the
            person said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 1.6 percent
            to $31.66 at the 4 p.m. close in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Minecraft Creator Sets Aside Microsoft Criticisms to Pursue Deal</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;By negotiating to sell his gaming startup to Microsoft (MSFT) Corp., Minecraft creator Markus
            Persson is growing closer to a company he once publicly lambasted -- and has a chance of becoming a
            billionaire at the age of 35. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Swede, who's gained 1.8 million Twitter followers and
            the admiration of gamers worldwide after creating Minecraft in 2009, has used his fame to pour scorn on
            companies from Facebook Inc. (FB) to Electronic Arts Inc. while touting the values of being 'indie.'
            Microsoft, a $386 billion giant dominating the global software industry, has received its fair share of
            Persson's appraisal of large corporations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Got an email from microsoft, wanting to help
            'certify' minecraft for win 8,' Persson wrote on Twitter in September 2012, referring to Microsoft's Windows
            8 software. 'I told them to stop trying to ruin the pc as an open platform.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'd rather
            have minecraft not run on win 8 at all than to play along,' Persson, known for his black hat and dubbed
            'Notch' by the Minecraft community, posted that same day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Persson's comments about
            Microsoft have become less harsh since, and a sale to the Redmond, Washington-based company would cement a
            relationship that's been strengthening recently. Microsoft, maker of the Xbox video-game console, is in
            talks to buy Persson's company, Mojang AB, for more than $2 billion, people with knowledge of the talks
            said. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Seattle's Madrona Taps Former Microsoft Executive DelBene</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executive
            Kurt DelBene is joining Madrona Venture Group as a partner where
            he'll help the Seattle-based firm identify new investments and
            work on strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DelBene, most recently spent six months as senior adviser
            to the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services, where he
            managed the Obamacare insurance enrollment program. Prior to
            that, he spent 21 years at Microsoft, most recently as president
            of the company's Office division, before leaving in 2013 amid a
            reorganization. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Madrona focuses on early-stage technology companies in the
            U.S. Northwest. Founded in 1995, the firm's past investments
            include Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Redfin Corp., the online real-estate
            brokerage. DelBene said his time at Microsoft has given him
            experience in both consumer and enterprise businesses that he'll
            be able to apply at Madrona. While at the software maker he also
            worked on starting up newer areas such as the cloud-based
            versions of Office. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The tech community in the Seattle area is just exploding
            so it was an opportunity to feel like I could make a
            contribution while having fun as well,' he said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Seattle is in the midst of boom led by online businesses
            such as Zillow Inc., Blue Nile Inc. and Zulily Inc., as well as
            Amazon, that's made it the fastest-growing among the top 50 U.S.
            cities. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;DelBene said he was talking to Madrona when he left
            Microsoft and put the discussions on hold when President Barack Obama recruited him to improve the federal
            health exchange. He
            committed to a six-month effort there and asked Madrona to
            restart discussions with him when that finished. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He's married to U.S. Representative Suzan DelBene, a
            Democrat from Washington state, who is running for re-election
            and is also a former Microsoft executive. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;(Corrects spelling of Microsoft spokesman's name in 6th paragraph.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 22,
            2000, a few months after Steve Ballmer took over as CEO of Microsoft, the company summoned several hundred
            reporters and analysts to a conference center at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Ballmer, under
            pressure from a U.S. antitrust case and super-hot dot-com rivals, was set to unveil his company's vision for
            the future of computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat in a packed room as Microsoft held a daylong series of
            sessions during which the company announced what it called the .NET strategy. To regain its place within the
            vanguard of personal computing, Ballmer's Microsoft promised to deliver an interconnected set of Web
            services that could serve up relevant information to users across multiple devices and let them share with
            family, friends and co-workers. In a statement then, Ballmer said Microsoft would create a "unified platform
            through which devices and services cooperate with each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft filmed a bunch of
            concept videos to illustrate its product ideas. You can watch an edited version of the videos at the top of
            this post. Cheesiness aside, it's pretty spot-on, no? There's personalized content for each family member
            synchronized across PCs, televisions, tablets, mobile phones and cars; location-aware devices that tell you
            when friends are nearby; photo-sharing; voice controls -- all years before Facebook, Foursquare, or Apple's
            iCloud and Siri.&lt;/p&gt;

            Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, who's been at the helm for more than a decade and

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Buying Minecraft would help
            Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella in his
            drive to get the company's software onto any mobile device --
            even those made by competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Since becoming CEO in February, Nadella has declared that
            he wants to have Microsoft programs work across many gadgets, in
            a break from having the company's software running primarily on
            hardware that uses its Windows operating system. In March,
            Nadella said he would 'hold nothing back' to achieve that
            goal. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With Minecraft maker Mojang AB, Nadella would acquire not
            only a popular game for Microsoft's Xbox video-game business,
            but also a hot property that works on Apple Inc.'s iPad, Sony
            Corp.'s Playstation and phones based on Google Inc.'s Android.
            Any deal, which would be Nadella's first since taking over
            Microsoft, would also underline the CEO's commitment to Xbox.
            While investors have long debated whether Microsoft should spin
            off the consumer-oriented business, Nadella said in a
            companywide memo in July that he would invest in the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'If there was any thought of Nadella wavering on Xbox, you
            can throw that out the window,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at
            FBR Capital Markets Co. 'There is also a broader view on how
            it fits with his strategy as part of cloud and mobile.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft to Buy Minecraft Maker Mojang for $2.5 Billion</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), maker of the Xbox video-game console, agreed to acquire Mojang AB, the
            software company behind the popular game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion, in a bid to boost its Xbox and mobile
            businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, said Stockholm-based Mojang
            will join its game-studio division, though the company's founders will move on to other projects. The
            purchase is projected to close late this year, and will break even in fiscal 2015, Microsoft said today in a
            statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Buying Mojang would be the biggest deal struck since Satya Nadella took over
            as Microsoft's chief executive officer in February, succeeding Steve Ballmer. The purchase gives Nadella a
            game that is popular across consoles, computers and mobile devices made by Microsoft and rivals like Apple
            Inc. It also bolsters a push to woo serious gamers back to Xbox after a lackluster attempt to turn the
            system into an all-in-one device that serves up broader content such as movies and music. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Acquiring
            the Minecraft game through the Mojang acquisition gives Mr. Nadella Co. the right product at the right time
            as the company continues to invest in its Xbox strategy and begins its foray into the intensely competitive
            mobile-phone space with Nokia now under Microsoft's hood and the restructuring plan under way,' Daniel Ives,

        <headline>With Minecraft, Microsoft Bets Again on Blockbuster Game Franchises Over Talent</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is that acquisitions are about gaining great talent. Just
            last week, Tim Cook told Charlie Rose that one of the main reasons Apple bought Beats was for "incredible
            talent." The Valley even has its own term for an acquisition based solely on hiring: "acquihire."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But
            that's not why Microsoft is spending $2.5 billion for Mojang. The purveyor of all things Xbox is buying the
            Swedish developer for the mega-hit video game Minecraft. That's it. While Mojang says the "vast majority" of
            employees are expected to stick around until after the deal closes, the three founders are leaving right
            away. That includes Markus "Notch" Persson, the face of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headline on
            Microsoft's press release is telling: "Minecraft to join Microsoft." Not Mojang. Minecraft. That's a
            pragmatic way to describe the deal: Just about every kid and parent has heard of Minecraft, which has sold
            more than 54 million copies, comprising virtually all of the small studio's revenue. But Microsoft seems to
            indicate that this isn't about cultivating an eccentric group of independent-minded game designers; it's
            about Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on its acquisition strategy, referring us
            to a generic statement that reads: "Microsoft has acquired Mojang and the iconic Minecraft franchise. We're
            honored to partner with them to carry Minecraft forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox
            who led the Minecraft deal, seems to place a premium on franchises. He also helped broker Microsoft's
            purchase of the Gears of War franchise in January from Epic Games, a high-profile developer led by
            antagonistic creatives. In the announcement, Spencer noted that the shooter series "has a very strong,
            passionate and valued fan base on Xbox." They've bought 22 million copies of the Gears of War games,
            grossing more than $1 billion, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus on cultivating successful franchises,
            rather than brilliant but sometimes fickle visionaries, makes a lot of sense, says Billy Pidgeon, an
            independent consultant to the games industry. Video games are a lot like Hollywood, and a recognizable title
            goes a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's talent plays haven't always produced results. In 2002, the
            company bought Rare, the British studio behind some of the most beloved Nintendo games including Donkey Kong
            Country and GoldenEye 007. Rare didn't own most of the franchises it worked on, and it hasn't produced a
            major hit under Microsoft. Founders Tim and Chris Stamper left Microsoft in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bungie
            Software joined Microsoft in 2000, a year before releasing the first in its blockbuster Halo series. The
            developer created five Halo games until the relationship became untenable. Microsoft agreed in 2007 to spin
            off Bungie into an independent company, without Halo. Microsoft established its own development team devoted
            to Halo, and that group is creating a new version of Halo every year. Each one has been selling well.
            Meanwhile, Bungie teamed up with Activision to release Destiny on Sept. 9. That's already on track to be a
            massive franchise, generating $500 million in revenue in its first day available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
            addition to Halo, Microsoft lists a series called Fable among its "global blockbuster franchises." That one
            came from the 2006 acquisition of Lionhead Studios. The company, also British, was started a decade earlier
            by Peter Molyneux, who's somewhat legendary in the gaming world for his innovative games, grand visions and
            over-promising. Molyneux, who has a lot of fans and critics, resigned in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing
            with games is it can be more volatile, and you're really dependent on the talent: You lose them, and you're
            in a bad place," says Pidgeon. "Franchises are always worthwhile. As long as you continue to keep the
            quality and continue to develop it in line with expectations, it can be really valuable. It's guaranteed to
            sell. As long as there are millions of people playing it, they'll continue to play it. The games business is
            very hit-driven."&lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Plans $40 Billion Buyback, Boosts Dividend</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's
            largest software maker, announced a new $40 billion stock
            buyback plan and increased its dividend 22 percent, seeking to
            reward shareholders as the company undergoes a change in
            strategy and leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The repurchase program, which has no expiration date,
            replaces another $40 billion buyback plan that was due to lapse
            at the end of this month, Microsoft said today in a statement.
            The company's quarterly dividend will rise to 28 cents a share,
            payable on Dec. 12 to shareholders of record as of Nov. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The move is a step in the right direction for investors,
            though the open-ended schedule for the new buyback plan raises
            questions, said Matthew Hedberg, an analyst with RBC Capital
            Markets in Minneapolis. The company has come under pressure from
            activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP, which pushed Microsoft
            to return more money to shareholders, according to a person with
            knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'What would be more interesting is if they put more
            parameters on the timing of the buyback -- sooner is better than
            later,' said Hedberg, who has a neutral rating on Microsoft.
            'The dividend is more material because it's incremental to
            their existing dividend.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) isn't the only Web
            property with a new look. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)'s Bing search engine
            is unveiling today a revamped website with a redesigned logo. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The brand features a simpler typeface 'created to be
            simple, real and direct' that better matches the font used on
            other Microsoft products, Scott Erickson, senior director, brand
            and creative at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. The company
            also changed how it displays search results, moving from three
            columns to two. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been rolling out changes to Bing about twice
            a year and last unveiled a new design in May 2012, seeking to
            attract more search users and narrow the gap with Google Inc. (GOOG)
            The No. 1 software maker is undergoing a management transition
            and struggling to break into mobile devices as users shift away
            from personal computers, while keeping up investment in Web
            services. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft had 17.9 percent of the search market in August,
            up one percentage point from March, according to ComScore Inc. (SCOR)
            Google leads with a 66.9 percent share, while Yahoo trails both
            at 11.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, said in July that
            its online-services business, largely advertising revenue from
            Bing and other online properties, posted an operating loss of
            $1.28 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is firing 2,100
            workers today, part of a plan announced in July to eliminate
            18,000 jobs to streamline the workforce and integrate the
            acquisition of Nokia Oyj's handset unit. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The job reductions will take place across the company in
            various divisions, said Peter Wootton, a spokesman for
            Microsoft. In the Puget Sound region, where Microsoft is based,
            747 people are being cut. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nadella has been aggressive in making changes since he
            became CEO in February, replacing Steve Ballmer. He has shuffled
            management, emphasized making Microsoft's software available for
            all types of devices, and announced the job cuts. Earlier this
            week, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it would buy
            Mojang AB, maker of the Minecraft video game, for $2.5 billion
            in Nadella's first deal as CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were little changed at $46.55 at 12:34
            p.m. in New York. The stock has gained 24 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
            Officer Steve Ballmer, who will be retiring within a year, said
            the company is still working to make sure that the personal
            computer remains relevant as 'the device of choice.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He made his comment as Windows, which dominated computing
            for more than two decades, now makes up 25 percent of revenue.
            The operating system slipped to become Microsoft's third-largest
            business after Office, which generated 32 percent of sales, and
            Server and Tools, which garnered 26 percent for the latest
            fiscal year through June. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Ballmer's remarks were being closely watched as he shakes
            up the world's largest software maker amid a shift by consumers
            toward smartphones and tablets and away from PCs running
            Windows. The CEO overhauled Microsoft's management and strategy
            to accelerate development of hardware and services, agreeing
            this month to buy Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit for $7.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We must do the work to ensure that the PC stays the
            device of choice when they're trying to be productive in life,'
            Ballmer said at a meeting for analysts and institutional
            shareholders, the first in two years. Ballmer said the company
            will have to work hard to keep the industry 'north of 300
            million' units. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Nokia's Elop to Get $25 Million If Microsoft Deal Done</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Stephen Elop, the former Nokia (NOK1V) Oyj
            chief executive officer who is rejoining Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), is set
            to get more than $25 million if the Finnish company completes
            the sale of its handset business to the software maker. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will pay 70 percent of the projected total amount
            of about 18.8 million euros ($25.5 million), and Nokia the
            remainder, according to a proxy filing by Espoo, Finland-based
            Nokia today. The value of Elop's reward is estimated using
            Nokia's Sept. 6 closing share price and may still change. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The 49-year-old Canadian, who was CEO at Nokia for three
            years, will move back to Microsoft as part of the 5.44 billion-euro takeover announced this month. He is a
            candidate to succeed
            Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who is preparing to step down. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Nokia shares have dropped by more than a third since Elop
            was hired on Sept. 10, 2010, even with the stock's gain since
            the sale to Microsoft was announced. Nokia shareholders are set
            to vote Nov. 19 on the transaction, which will see a business
            that accounted for half of the company's 2012 revenue, along
            with 32,000 employees, transfer to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The shares fell 1.1 percent to 4.89 euros at 6:06 p.m. in
            Helsinki. Nokia has a market value of 18.3 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;

            at the close in New York, leaving the stock up 23 percent this year. The shares rose 7.3 percent the day
            Ballmer announced his retirement, then fell 4.6 percent when Microsoft said it would buy Nokia. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Challenging Environment &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;PC shipments will decline 9.7 percent this year to
            315.4 million and won't ever return to the peak levels it reached in 2011, according to researcher IDC. The
            market will shrink until 2015, it said. The slumping popularity of the devices is coming as consumers
            increasingly turn to smartphones and tablets, two markets where Microsoft and the PC industry have lagged.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Windows accounted for 3.7 percent of smartphone operating-system shipments in the second
            quarter, according to IDC. In the tablet market, that figure was 4.5 percent, IDC said. Microsoft's
            first-ever computer hardware, the Surface tablet, sold so poorly the company had to write down $900 million
            of unsold inventory. Introduced in October, the handheld device was aimed at taking on Apple Inc.'s iPad, as
            well as touchscreen computers running Google Inc.'s Android software. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'The challenges
            are fairly obvious and the questions are about how to execute,' said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams
            Wright Ragen in Seattle. 'They've laid out a strategy of being more of a devices- and services-focused
            company, and started to execute on that. Nokia is part of that.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Evolution
            &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer is reorganizing Microsoft into fewer units around devices and services, while
            separating corporate tasks like marketing and finance. As part of the restructuring, the company will report
            results from five new segments beginning from the current fiscal first quarter, which ends this month. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said she'll give more detailed information on the company's new
            financial-reporting structure on a Sept. 26 conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ballmer told
            analysts that the company will perform better in the future by having its business, consumer, software and
            device units work together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'Hardware and software will kind of need to evolve
            together,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long Microsoft &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some shareholders have been
            seeking more of a say in Microsoft's strategy and finances. The company said earlier this week it will raise
            quarterly dividends by 22 percent to 28 cents a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of 26 cents.
            Microsoft sought to head off shareholder dissent last month by reaching a cooperation agreement with
            ValueAct Holdings LP, which would let the activist investor claim a board seat starting next year. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it's still seeking a new CEO, and didn't offer any updates on the process. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The board continues on the process that we laid out in late August,' Hood said at the conference,
            which was delayed by a power failure at the venue in Bellevue, Washington. 'We'll update you when
            appropriate.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are only a few companies making the investments in data centers and
            technology needed to provide future devices and services that consumers and companies will demand, Ballmer
            said. Microsoft won't be 'religious' about having its services work only with Microsoft hardware, and will
            keep offering them on Apple and Google's products, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also continue
            to challenge Google, which has secured a pole position in Internet search and is one of the few companies
            with the breadth to take on Microsoft, Ballmer said. Regulators should look at what he called Google's
            'monopoly' in search, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'I'm long Microsoft,' said Ballmer, who owns about 4
            percent of the company. 'I treasure it as an investor, too.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Seeks to Woo Tablet Customers With New Surfaces</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced two new versions of its Surface tablet, the software maker's
            latest bid to challenge Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in the hardware market after its first
            devices fell flat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Surface Pro, powered by an Intel Corp. chip, is 20 percent
            faster and features an all-day battery with 75 percent more life, Panos Panay, the company's Surface vice
            president, said at an event in New York today. The Surface 2 has a high-definition screen and 25 percent
            better battery life, and runs on an Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) chip based on ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) technology.
            &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft jumped into the touch-screen tablet market, dominated by Apple's iPad and
            models running Google Inc.'s Android software, in June 2012 with the announcement of its first Surface.
            Designed to keep its Windows software relevant as consumers shift to tablets from personal computers and
            laptops, the Surface instead generated such little demand that Microsoft took a $900 million inventory
            writedown last quarter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft 'bet the farm on touch and tablet,' said Wes Miller,
            an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, a Kirkland, Washington-based research firm. They've 'got to move some
            serious tablets,' he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Thinner Covers &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the
            devices will go on sale on Oct. 22. The Pro, which runs on Intel's Haswell chip, starts at $899, and the
            Surface 2, the successor to the Surface RT, starts at $449. The company also introduced new, thinner
            versions of the device's covers that come with built-in keyboards -- and one model boosts the tablets'
            battery life even further. There's also a docking station that lets the Surface Pro connect to a computer
            monitor and speakers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'This is the most powerful tablet in the world,' Panay said of the
            new Surface Pro. 'This thing's a beast.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Surface 2 is priced at $50 less than its
            predecessor when it was introduced. The new Pro starts at the same price as the earlier model when it
            debuted. That may still be too high to attract more buyers, though Microsoft has packed more powerful chips
            and hardware into the Pro to try to make it a better value, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'It's going to
            be interesting to see how the market receives it -- they're both still premium-priced devices,' he said.
            'They were inspired by Apple's model, which is you create premium devices and premium accessories and you
            hope that people are willing to pay premium prices.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surface 2 comes with a copy of
            Microsoft's Office applications, and both devices include free Skype Internet-based calls to landlines
            internationally, Skype Wi-Fi and free storage on Microsoft's cloud service. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Little
            Traction &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company has thus far failed to get traction in
            the market. Surface accounted for 0.7 percent of the 44.3 million tablets sold in the second quarter,
            according to researcher IDC. The device was too expensive, riddled with software bugs and featured too few
            applications, Miller said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Android controlled 62.6 percent of the tablet market and
            Apple had 32.5 percent, according to IDC. Android software is used in tablets manufactured by companies
            including Samsung and Sony Corp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tablet shipments will top those of PCs for the first
            time in the fourth quarter, IDC said earlier this month. Some 84.1 million tablets will be shipped, compared
            with 83.1 million PCs, the researcher said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft entered the tablet hardware market
            in part because traditional manufacturers of Windows computers weren't stepping up with compelling devices.
            Still, among Windows tablets with Intel chips, Surface is being outsold by vendors like Acer Inc. and
            Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), IDC said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hardware Competition &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While
            giving a boost to the Windows business, the competition hurts the prospects of Microsoft's hardware unit,
            fueling opposition from investors, who have balked at the Surface writedown and Microsoft's agreement to
            spend $7.2 billion on Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset unit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;'For Windows, Surface is less
            important as long as other people's tablets do OK,' Miller said. The hardware challenge 'poses an
            interesting conundrum given that Microsoft just bought a phone company.' &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microsoft said
            it sold $853 million worth of Surface tablets in the fiscal year that ended June 30. To sell more devices,
            the company has cut prices, and earlier this month it started offering at least $200 in coupons to its
            retail stores if customers traded in a used iPad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;</body>

        <headline>Microsoft Forms China Game Venture to Capitalize on Trade Zone</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is forming a video-game venture with a Chinese company to capitalize on
            proposed
            free-trade rules that would end a 13-year ban on foreign
            companies selling consoles in the world's largest nation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft and BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a subsidiary of Shanghai
            Media Group, formed a $79 million gaming venture, the Chinese
            company announced in a statement to Shanghai's stock exchange on
            Sept. 23. BesTV will invest $40.29 million for a 51 percent
            stake, while Microsoft will invest $38.71 million for the rest,
            according to the filing. BesTV surged by the 10 percent limit to
            51.11 yuan in Shanghai trading yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox 360, Nintendo Co.'s Wii U
            and Sony Corp. (6758)'s PlayStation were banned by China in 2000 to
            protect youths from the perceived corrupting influence of video
            games. They turned to online games including Tencent Holdings
            Ltd. (700)'s 'League of Legends,' and game consoles are on a list of
            items to be liberalized when Shanghai's free-trade zone opens,
            according to a draft plan seen by Bloomberg News. The zone will
            open on Sept. 29, China's official Xinhua News Agency said on
            its microblog yesterday, citing the local government. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Adopts Plan to Keep Executives During CEO Shift</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is altering its
            compensation plan so that the company can use special equity
            incentives to retain executives during a transition to a new
            chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The software maker's board approved the potential stock
            awards, which will vest over a term of at least 30 months,
            seeking to ensure 'continuity of key leaders during the
            transition,' Microsoft said in a filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's CEO since 2000, said last month
            that he will retire within a year and directors are currently
            looking for his replacement among internal and external
            candidates. The change in leadership is happening amid the
            company's biggest reorganization in more than a decade, as it
            grapples with a decline in personal-computer sales as consumers
            shift to smartphones and tablets. Adding to the upheaval,
            Microsoft said earlier this month that it plans to acquire Nokia
            Oyj (NOK1V)'s handset business. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While the incentive is also aimed at making sure 'key
            executives have sufficient unvested equity to provide alignment
            with shareholders,' the stock awards won't exceed share limits
            previously in place, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
            in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Some Microsoft executives sought to reassure spooked
            managers by e-mailing their staff last month to say they remain
            committed to the CEO's reorganization plan, even after Ballmer
            said he would retire, people with knowledge of the matter had
            said. Some executives saw an increase in outside job offers
            since the restructuring plan was unveiled in July, and others
            may be tempted to leave since stock grants and bonuses are
            awarded in late August, said the people. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Google, Microsoft Urge Changes to Avoid Abuse at EU Patent Court</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and at
            least 12 other companies urged the European Union to change
            draft rules that will guide the way the bloc's first patent
            court operates. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'We appreciate that Europe has long worked towards a
            unified patent system, and we hope the proposed new system will
            be a significant step forward,' the companies, including Apple
            Inc. (AAPL) said in a letter that was sent to EU institutions today.
            'We are concerned' that aspects of the draft rules 'may
            undermine these benefits by creating significant opportunities
            for abuse.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;EU ministers in February approved plans to set up the first
            patent court, paving the way for a common patent system after a
            decades-long deadlock on the plans. Costs for getting patent
            protection in Europe could be cut by more than 30,000 euros
            ($40,443) under a new common patent system, the European
            Commission, the EU's executive agency has said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One of the companies' concerns is that the rules aren't
            clear enough on when or how it will be decided whether a
            particular patent is valid and that this 'could undermine,
            rather than promote, innovation in Europe.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>PC Games King Seeks to Dethrone Sony, Microsoft Consoles</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Valve Corp., operator of the
            largest online store for downloading video games to PCs, is
            developing consoles that would use its more than 50 million
            customers to challenge Sony Corp. (6758) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The closely held company, maker of the 'Half-Life'
            titles, captures 75 percent of the global market for digital PC
            games through its Steam store, researcher IHS Screen Digest
            estimates. Valve has developed a prototype console and is
            working with hardware partners to start selling models in 2014,
            according to a statement yesterday on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'The specific machine we're testing is designed for users
            who want the most control possible over their hardware,' the
            company said. 'Other boxes will optimize for size, price,
            quietness, or other factors.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valve is going on the offensive as its own turf is
            attacked, banking on a growing base of personal-computer gamers
            to carve a chunk of the $15 billion market for home consoles.
            Microsoft and Sony, which are introducing new machines for the
            holidays, have started their own online portals to duplicate
            Steam's success selling games through the Internet -- as have
            Wii U maker Nintendo Co. and publisher Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 1.2 percent, to $32.88 at 1:25 p.m. New York
            time. Electronic Arts fell 0.5 percent to $26.47, while Sony's
            American depositary receipts added 0.7 percent to $21.26. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Harvard Dropout &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While Valve doesn't disclose sales, digital distribution of
            pc games this year will comprise $5.5 billion of the $21.4
            billion computer games market, according to researcher DFC
            Intelligence. IHS estimates Valve generated $1.1 billion in 2012
            from full-game downloads. Steam also offers downloadable game
            add-ons and multiplayer titles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'This substantial user base makes Valve and its community
            of PC gamers a potentially significant threat to other
            established games platforms,' said Piers Harding-Rolls, an IHS
            analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Doug Lombardi, a Valve spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Valve, based in Bellevue, Washington, was co-founded by
            Gabe Newell, a Harvard dropout who spent 13 years working on the
            Windows operating system at Microsoft, according to a September
            2007 interview with the site ComputerAndVideoGames. He rarely
            speaks with the press. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The company is a pioneer of downloading games from the
            Internet and creating communities of players. It started Steam
            'as a little sleeper project' in 2002, according to its
            website, to let gamers download updates to its 'Counter-Strike' action title. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;New Consoles &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steam originally distributed games solely on Windows PCs,
            taking a cut of each sale, before expanding to Mac titles and
            Linux-based games. The new SteamOS that will power the consoles
            will be based on the Linux operating system and require
            developers to create games using that software. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It allows for media sharing across connected devices, live
            streaming, family sharing of content and parental controls,
            Valve said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like Ouya Inc., another challenger to incumbent console
            makers, Valve may struggle to get developers to make games for
            its operating system, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities
            analyst in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'They only way they sell it is to give us a reason why we
            need it,' Pachter said. 'If they make every game work better
            with this OS, that's great, but I don't see how it becomes a big
            threat to the console guys.' &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;PC Drop &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While digital downloads of PC games have more than doubled
            since 2007, fewer people are buying personal computers. That's
            forcing Steam to look elsewhere for future growth. PC sales
            peaked in 2011, according to research firm IDC, and are expected
            to decline 9.7 percent this year as more users migrate to
            tablets and other mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Steam also faces pressure from Sony's coming PlayStation 4
            and Microsoft's Xbox One, both reaching U.S. stores in November.
            They use a PC-like architecture, making it easier for smaller
            developers that now flock to Steam. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Last year, the number of consoles in consumers' homes,
            including the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii U, stood at 238
            million, according to IHS Screen Digest. Spending on console
            software was $12.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sony Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai, former head of
            the Japanese company's PlayStation business, said in January any
            new competitors will have a tough time against incumbents. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'It's really difficult to try and build a platform
            business,' Hirai said in an interview. 'I've managed it
            personally, so I know it's a gradual process, not an overnight
            thing.' &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Plans Flagship NY Store Blocks From Apple's</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), maker of the Xbox
            video-game consoles, said it plans to open its first flagship
            store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, about six blocks from a
            similar location operated by Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft's store will open at 677 Fifth Avenue, according
            to a blog post. The company didn't say when the store would
            open. The address is currently home to luxury retailer Fendi,
            according to Google Maps. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft is acquiring Mojang AB, the software company
            behind the popular game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion, in a bid to
            boost its Xbox and mobile businesses. The Redmond, Washington-based company said the new store would
            showcase products such as
            its Surface tablet and Windows Phones. The Mojang purchase would
            give Microsoft a game that's popular across consoles, computers
            and mobile devices including those made by rivals like Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apple opened its flagship store at 767 Fifth Avenue in New
            York in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

        <headline>Microsoft Builds Indian Data Centers to Tap New Market</headline>
        <body>
            &lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will build data
            centers in India to tap demand for cloud-based computing as it
            plans to offer its Azure and Office 365 services in the world's
            second-most populous nation. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Azure, which lets businesses access computing resources and
            run programs via the Internet, will be available from local data
            centers by the end of 2015, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella told reporters in New Delhi today. Office
            365, a cloud-based subscription version of Microsoft's productivity programs,
            will be available at the same time, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is a key part of Nadella's plan to
            transform Microsoft and retain relevance as consumers shift from
            desktops to tablets and smartphones by keeping information
            stored on remote servers instead of a local hard drives. The
            world's biggest software maker competes against rivals including
            Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Google Inc. for clients in India, a market
            expected to reach $1.7 billion by 2018 according to Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;'Microsoft's cloud services in India have grown over 100
            percent in revenue in the past year,' the company said in a
            statement. 'Microsoft's locally available cloud services will
            open opportunities for banking, financial services, and
            insurance companies, state-owned enterprises and government
            departments.' &lt;/p&gt;
