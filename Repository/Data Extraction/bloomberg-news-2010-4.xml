Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest
software maker, sued Datel Design  Development Ltd., claiming
the U.K. company is infringing design patents for controllers
used with the Xbox 360 video-game system. 
In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Seattle today,
Microsoft is seeking damages and a court order that would halt
sales of Datel's TurboFire and WildFire controllers. Microsoft
also sued Datel in the U.K. and filed a complaint with the U.S.
International Trade Commission in Washington, seeking to block
U.S. imports of the controllers made in China. 
The game controllers provide "a firepower advantage that
can make all the difference," Datel, based in Staffordshire,
England, said on its Web site. They can turn a single-shot
pistol in the "Call of Duty" into "lethal, fully automatic
weapons that can empty a clip on an enemy in a second." 
The patent complaints "appear retaliatory," Datel lawyer
Martin Glick said in a telephone interview. "They said the
controller would interfere with the fair play of games and then
they licensed a controller that did exactly that." 
Glick, of Howard Rice in San Francisco, said he hadn't
reviewed the complaints so couldn't comment on the specific
allegations. 
Unfair Advantage 
Microsoft has said in court filings that the accessories
give their users an unfair advantage in multiplayer gaming. The
TurboFire and WildFire controllers copy unique designs protected
by six U.S. patents, Microsoft said in the complaint. 
More than 74 million Xbox 360 game controllers have been
sold worldwide since 2005, including about 40 million in the
U.S., according to the ITC complaint. 
"The designs of the WildFire Controller are the same or
substantially the same to the eye of the ordinary observer as
the ornamental designs claimed in the Microsoft patents,"
Microsoft said. 
Datel also sells a memory card that it says is four times
as powerful as the one that Microsoft offers. In October,
Microsoft deployed what it called a "dashboard update" that
disabled Datel's memory cards. 
Datel filed an antitrust lawsuit in November against
Microsoft, claiming the Redmond, Washington-based company seeks
to monopolize the markets for multiplayer online gaming systems
and for accessories not sold directly with the Xbox. 
Memory Cards 
Glick, who called the update a "downgrade," said it was
designed to shut down Datel because the memory cards were
driving down the price of Microsoft's. 
Microsoft has asked that the antitrust suit be dismissed,
saying Datel isn't legally entitled to sell "accessories that
open the door for cheating that harms the Xbox 360 ecosystem." 
Microsoft said in the ITC complaint it has sold or licensed
more than $7 billion worth of products that use the patents at
issue in the case. "U.S. sales and licensing revenue for Xbox
360 gamepads alone account for more than $100 million," the
company said in the complaint. 
"The success of Microsoft's Xbox 360 has not gone
unnoticed by others who seek to gain from Microsoft's
investment, creativity and goodwill," the company said in the
filing. 
The new case is Microsoft Corp. v. Datel Design and
Development Ltd., 10cv562, U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Washington (Seattle). The antitrust case is Datel
Holdings Ltd. v. Microsoft Corp., 09cv5535, U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California (San Francisco). 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Game Controllers,
Complaint No. 2722, U.S. International Trade Commission
(Washington).

Microsoft Corp., the world's largest
software maker, has no plans to make a version of its Office
suite of programs to run on Apple Inc.'s iPad, said Stephen
Elop, president of Microsoft's business division. 
Elop said the company would take a "wait and see"
approach to tailoring software for the iPad, which goes on sale
on April 3. He also said Google Inc. hasn't made any headway
against Microsoft in the business software market. 
"We haven't heard anything about Google making inroads
against Office, because they're not," Elop said today in an
interview. Office includes word-processing, spreadsheet and
other business-productivity programs. 
Microsoft will begin selling the next version of the
product, dubbed Office 2010, on May 12. The debut comes as
Google and other Web companies are pushing alternatives that
cost less or are even free. Office brings in about 90 percent of
the revenue of Elop's division, which is the company's largest
and one of its most profitable. 
The version of Office 2010 that goes on sale on May 12 is
designed for businesses. A version for consumers will be
available by late June. By then, the company also will introduce
stripped-down versions of Word and the spreadsheet program Excel
that are accessible free over the Web. 
Demand looks promising, particularly from companies, and 6
million people have downloaded a prerelease "beta" version of
the product, Elop said. That's twice as many as downloaded the
beta version of Office 2007, the last upgrade. 
Of those beta users polled by Microsoft, 80 percent said
they would recommend Office 2010 to friends, and 90 percent said
the software made them more productive, he said. 
Cloud Computing 
Elop said corporate buyers are less interested in
discussing Google and other competitors and more concerned about
whether to move to new "cloud"-based versions of Microsoft
software. Customers who choose this route don't run the software
on their own computers, instead paying a monthly fee to
Microsoft to deliver it over the Internet from the company's
massive data centers. 
"We never say never, but we have no current plans" to
develop a version of Office for the Apple iPad, Elop said. Last
year Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it would create a
version to work on Nokia Oyj's smartphones, since millions of
Office users already own those devices. 
An iPad edition of Office would likely be built by a unit
within Microsoft's consumer business that creates versions of
Office that work with Apple's Macintosh personal computers.
Kristen Woody, a spokesman for that unit, says it "doesn't have
anything to share at this time." 
Microsoft fell 13 cents to $29.16 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. After gaining 57 percent last year,
the shares have slipped 4.3 percent in 2010.

Microsoft Corp. failed in its bid to
have a U.S. appeals court take a second look at a patent-
infringement case that forced it to change its popular Word
software and resulted in a damage award that's grown to more
than $290 million. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit today
rejected a request that the Dec. 22 ruling won by closely held
I4i LP of Toronto be heard by the full 12-member court. The
decision was announced in a notice on the court's Web site. 
Microsoft has called the case the largest patent-
infringement verdict ever upheld on appeal. The request for a
rehearing centered on testimony related to damages, whether
Microsoft's infringement was intentional, and whether Microsoft
should have been forced to remove what the company called an
"obscure functionality" or stop selling Word. 
I4i's invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. Microsoft issued an update to Word to comply
with the court order. 
Word is part of Microsoft's Office software, used by more
than 500 million people. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
testing Office 2010 with customers. The completed version is
scheduled to be released by June. The unit that sells Office is
Microsoft's biggest, with $18.9 billion in sales in the year
ended June 30. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it's used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. I4i's patent was issued in 1998. 
The case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said he regrets using the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.'s guarantee program to issue $40 billion in
unsecured debt during the height of the financial crisis. 
"We didn't need it," Dimon, 54, said in his annual letter
to shareholders, which was released yesterday. "And it just
added to the argument that all banks had been bailed out and
fueled the anger directed toward banks." 
Dimon said the New York-based company was "highly
criticized" for issuing debt backed by the FDIC and for
accepting $25 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
The company repaid all TARP funds in June, stopped using the
FDIC's program last April and shunned participation in other
federal programs "to avoid the stigma," he said. 
JPMorgan, which ranks second behind Bank of America Corp.
in deposits and assets among U.S. lenders, remained profitable
through the crisis with combined net income of $17.3 billion in
the last two years. The company issued $20.8 billion in FDIC-
guaranteed long-term debt in 2008, and $19.7 billion in 2009. 
"It was not a question of access or need," Dimon said of
the FDIC program, whose government backing helped keep interest
rates low. "The markets always were open to us, but the program
did save us money." 
FDIC Program 
FDIC spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment. About 6,500
eligible institutions opted out of the Temporary Liquidity
Guarantee Program. More than 80 banks and thrifts used the
program to issue debt, about $305.4 billion of which was still
outstanding as of Feb. 28, according to FDIC data. 
Dimon apologized for what he said were the bank's mistakes.
He said the two biggest were lowering mortgage underwriting
standards and making too many leveraged loans that "may have
contributed to the financial crisis." At the same time, he
claimed some credit for helping to stabilize markets through
JPMorgan's purchases of Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual. 
He also sought to deflect some of the public anger toward
financial companies and to correct the perception that all banks
would have failed if the federal government hadn't intervened. 
"We should acknowledge that the worst offenders among
financial companies no longer are in existence," Dimon said.
"And while it is true that some of the surviving banks would
not, or might not, have survived, not all banks would have
failed." 
Dimon, who took over as CEO in 2005, said his "No. 1
priority" this year is to find his successor. 
Internal Candidates 
"Poor CEO succession has destroyed many a company," Dimon
said, adding that the board believes there are several strong
internal candidates that could "do my job today." He said
JPMorgan will continue rotating senior staff across the business
to ensure they could smoothly take over the company. 
The company also intends to expand retail banking, which
accounted for $97 million of JPMorgan's $11.7 billion in net
income last year. Dimon said the bank will add 2,700 personal
bankers, 400 investment sales representatives and 120 more
branches this year, even though consumer lending lost $3.8
billion in 2009. The bank plans to ramp up its branch expansion
in California and Florida over the next two years, building on
its acquisition of Washington Mutual, he said.

Shopping mall owner General Growth
Properties Inc. filed definitive documents last night to raise
$6.55 billion in new equity from three investors in return for
65 percent of the stock. General Growth is setting up a bidding
procedure where other investors could end up being the equity
sponsors. 
In return for agreeing to be the so-called stalking-horse,
the three investors -- Fairholme Capital Management LLC,
Pershing Square Capital Management LP, and Brookfield Asset
Management Inc. -- will be given warrants for 120 million shares
exercisable at $15 a share. General Growth said in its court
filing last night that the warrants are worth $520 million. 
Combined with $1.5 billion through a new debt offering or
reinstatement of existing debt, General Growth says it will have
enough capital to confirm a plan at the holding company level.
Only $1 billion in debt at the property-owning level remains to
be formally reorganized through confirmation of reorganization
plans. 
General Growth says the plan will be sufficient to pay
unsecured creditors in full with interest. 
At an April 29 hearing, General Growth will ask the
bankruptcy judge to approve the warrants to the stalking-horse
investors and a schedule for wrapping up the case. General
Growth wants the first round of bids submitted by April 19, even
before the judge has approved procedures. 
General Growth is offering as much as $1 million in expense
reimbursement for anyone who participates in the bidding
process. 
The second round of bids would be due June 2, if the judge
agrees with the schedule. General Growth and representatives of
existing stockholders will then compare the bids, negotiate
further, and select the winning investors in time for filing a
reorganization plan and disclosure statement on July 2. 
The hearing for approval of the disclosure statement would
take place July 30, followed by a confirmation hearing for
approval of the plan on Sept. 30. 
Assuming there are no other bids, Fairholme would end up
with 28 percent of the new stock for a $2.8 billion investment.
Pershing Square is in line for 11 percent for $1.1 billion, and
Brookfield would receive 26 percent for $2.625 billion. 
Existing shareholders will retain 34 percent of the stock
through the Chapter 11 plan. Existing equity holders will also
receive 80 percent of the equity in a new company to own non-
core assets. 
General Growth also filed an operating report yesterday
showing $70.1 million in operating income during February on
revenue of $204.5 million. Interest expense in the month was
$91.7 million. 
The month produced $208.6 million in net income thanks to a
$222.9 million gain on reorganization items. In February, the
loss before  taxes, non-controlling interests and reorganization
items was $21.6 million. 
In seven batches of confirmations since December, General
Growth has formally reorganized property-owning subsidiaries
holding all except $1 billion on debt below the holding
companies. 
General Growth began the largest real estate reorganization
in history by filing under Chapter 11 in April 2009. The books
of Chicago-based General Growth had assets of $29.6 billion and
total liabilities of $27.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2008. It owns
or manages more than 200 shopping-mall properties. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
Updates 
Crescent Selects UBS and Aladdin as Lead Arrangers 
Real estate developer Crescent Resources LLC jilted RBS
Securities Inc. and instead intends on marrying itself to other
arrangers for a $125 million secured financing to aid in an exit
from bankruptcy reorganization. Creditors are voting on the
Crescent Chapter 11 plan in advance of a May 20 confirmation
hearing. 
Although the bankruptcy court already approved using RBS to
serve as lead arranger, Crescent said in a March 30 bankruptcy
court filing that UBS Securities LLC and Aladdin Capital LLC
made a better offer that has a "higher likelihood of success"
and contains "more favorable terms for the debtors." 
Crescent arranged an April 5 hearing for approval of the
agreement with UBS and Aladdin. For other Bloomberg coverage,
click here. 
Crescent's disclosure statement tells holders of $1.55
billion in pre-bankruptcy loans that they stand to recover 38
percent by receiving all the new stock and $265 million in two
tranches of second-lien notes. 
General unsecured creditors with almost $305 million in
claims are to be given the senior interest in a litigation
trust. The pre-bankruptcy lenders will have a subordinate
interest in the trust. The disclosure statement doesn't specify
the percentage recovery unsecured creditors are to receive. 
Secured lenders with mortgages against specific projects
are being paid in full, in some cases by receiving their
collateral. 
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Crescent filed under
Chapter 11 in June with commercial, residential and multifamily
projects in 10 southeastern and southwestern states. It listed
assets of $2.2 billion against debt totaling $1.9 billion,
including almost $1.5 billion on pre-bankruptcy credit
agreements. Crescent is a joint venture between Duke Energy
Corp. and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund. 
The case is In re Crescent Resources LLC, 09-11507, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Western District Texas (Austin). 
Lehman Proposes Buying Up Notes Underlying Flip Deals 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed a motion asking for
authority to extricate itself from derivate and swap agreements
where there are disputes about Lehman's rights. 
Many of the transactions involve a so-called flip clause in
a swap where collateral ordinarily would go first to a Lehman
subsidiary as the swap counterparty. Under the flip clause, the
bankruptcy of the swap counterparty or an affiliate would have
the collateral go first to noteholders and only to Lehman after
the noteholders were fully paid. 
The bankruptcy judge gave Lehman a victory when he ruled on
Jan. 25 in one of the transactions that the flip clause violates
a provision in bankruptcy law prohibiting so-called ipso facto
clauses where someone loses rights simply for filing in
bankruptcy or becoming insolvent. 
Despite Lehman's victory, the liquidating broker said the
counterparties aren't settling and in some cases are asserting
rights under foreign law where the result might follow an
English decision upholding the flip clause. 
To short circuit the third parties, Lehman is asking for
authority to buy up enough notes so it can force the liquidation
of collateral in particular transactions. Given Lehman's success
in litigation, the motion says that the notes are often trading
for less than market value. 
By buying up enough notes in a transaction, Lehman says it
may also have power in some cases to force settlement. Lehman
believes that buying notes will bring a quicker result than
litigating each transaction separately. 
If the bankruptcy judge grants the motion at an April 20
hearing, Lehman could buy as much as $25 million in notes in any
particular transaction so long as a creditors' committee
financial professional does not object within six hours. For
individual purchases more than $25 million, the judge must
approve if the creditors' committee doesn't consent. 
To read about the January decision regarding flip
transactions, click here and look for the Advance Sheets item in
the Feb. 1 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. 
More than 20 financial institutions and creditors objected
to Lehman's proposal for alternative dispute resolution of
claims. Wells Fargo Bank NA, for example, contends that the
three-step process is too time consuming and expensive for
creditors. The bank, as trustee in securitization trusts,
objects to how Lehman can name four mediators from which the
creditors must select one. 
The bank wants the ability to make counter proposals when
Lehman submits a settlement offer in advance of mediation. The
bank wants the right to attend mediation through teleconference
rather than being required to be present in person in New York. 
Wells Fargo and others want the ability to compel Lehman to
produce information in advance of mediation. 
The hearing for approval of mediation procedures is on the
bankruptcy court calendar for consideration at an April 14
hearing. 
Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP, Lehman's chief bankruptcy
counsel, disclosed in a bankruptcy court filing this week that
its top partners are charging $990 an hour. The least-expensive
partner's hourly rate is $725. The top rate for associates is
$695. The top rate for a partner from a foreign office $1,000. 
From the inception of the Chapter 11 case in September 2008
through February, Weil Gotshal charged Lehman $157.5 million. To
read other Bloomberg coverage, click here. 
The Lehman holding company filed under Chapter 11 in New
York on Sept. 15, 2008, and sold office buildings and the North
American investment banking business to London-based Barclays
Plc one week later. The Lehman brokerage operations went into
liquidation on Sept. 19, 2008, in the same court. The brokerage
is in the control of a trustee appointed under the Securities
Investor Protection Act. 
The Lehman holding company Chapter 11 case is In re Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555, while the liquidation
proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act for the
brokerage operation is Securities Investors Protection Corp. v.
Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District New York (Manhattan). 
Accredited Home at Impasse with Lone Star on Plan 
Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., a home mortgage
originator and securitizer prior to the Chapter 11 filing in
May, says negotiations on a Chapter 11 plan are at "impasse." 
The indenture trustee for junior subordinated noteholders
sued the owner Lone Star Funds, alleging fraudulent
representations were made in connection with the $300 million
acquisition in 2007. Since then, there were negotiations on a
Chapter 11 plan that failed, Accredited Home said in a March 29
motion for an extension of the exclusive right to propose a
Chapter 11 plan. 
The company says that the noteholders asked to hold up the
plan process for at least three months. To accommodate the
request, the company is asking to stretch out the exclusive
plan-filing right until Nov. 1. 
A hearing on the exclusivity motion will take place April
21. 
In the motion, Accredited Home said it filed a tax return
in February asking for a $57 million refund. The refund hasn't
yet been received. 
The creditors' committee already has a motion on the April
21 calendar for authority to bring claims on behalf of the
company against Dallas-based Lone Star. 
Accredited sold the mortgage servicing business in July
after the Chapter 11 filing in May. Most of the mortgage loans
were sold later. Lone Star also owns Bruno's Supermarkets LLC
and Bi-Lo LLC, two grocery retailers in Chapter 11. 
The Chapter 11 petition said assets are less than $50
million while debt exceeds $100 million. 
The case is In re Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., 09-
11516, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Still No LBO Settlement and No Reorg Plan for Tribune 
Newspaper publisher Tribune Co. is asking for a fifth
extension of the exclusive right to propose a Chapter 11 plan. 
The creditors' committee supports extending the deadline by
one month, to April 30. Tribune is aiming for an April 13
hearing on the so-called exclusivity motion. 
Tribune filed an operating report yesterday showing a $2.7
million net profit in February on $221.8 million in revenue. 
The case remains stuck in disputes over whether the $13.8
billion leveraged buyout led by Sam Zell in December 2007
resulted in fraudulent transfers. Tribune reiterated its belief
that settling the claims through a plan is the best outcome. 
Tribune said it couldn't provide details on negotiations
due to "confidentiality concerns." It promised to make more
disclosures before the April 13 hearing. 
The operating report has a $16.4 million operating profit
in February. Reorganization costs that cut into net profit
totaled $7.4 million. 
Creditors are working on the theory that the LBO was a
fraudulent transfer because operating subsidiaries put liens on
their assets to finance the Zell acquisition while not receiving
commensurate value in return. 
Tribune is the second-largest newspaper publisher in the
U.S. Tribune listed $13 billion in debt for borrowed money and
assets of $7.6 billion in the Chapter 11 reorganization begun in
December 2008. It owns the Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times,
six other newspapers and 23 television stations. 
The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District Delaware (Wilmington). 
Lyondell Settles Environmental Claim to Ease Confirmation 
Chemical producer Lyondell Chemical Co. negotiated a
settlement of $5.5 billion in environmental claims, in the
process removing an obstacle to approval of the reorganization
plan at the April 23 confirmation hearing. 
Under the plan and the settlement, Lyondell will transfer
specific environmentally impaired properties it owns to a trust
along with cash to perform a cleanup. 
All together, the U.S. government and seven states will
have approved unsecured claims aggregating $1.18 billion. In
addition, Lyondell will contribute $108.4 million cash to the
trust and pay another $61.6 million to settle other claims. 
The settlement will be up for approval at the April 23
confirmation hearing. To read other Bloomberg coverage, click
here. 
Financing for Lyondell's plan includes a backstopped $2.8
billion equity rights offering plus $5 billion in debt financing
via an asset-backed facility, a note offering, and a term loan. 
To read about the plan and the settlement with the
unsecured creditors' committee, click here and look for the
Lyondell item in the March 9 Bloomberg bankruptcy report. 
Lyondell and affiliate Equistar Chemicals LP, together
making up the third-largest independent producer of chemicals,
filed under Chapter 11 in January 2009, listing assets of $33.8
billion and debt totaling $30.3 billion. The parent
LyondellBasell Industries AF SCA filed under Chapter 11 in
April. Including the parent and European subsidiaries, the
assets were $40 billion in September 2008. Total revenue in 2007
was $44 billion. The Lyondell petition says its assets are $27.1
billion against $19.3 billion in debt while Equistar listed
assets and debt both totaling $9 billion. 
The case is Lyondell Chemical Co., 09-10023, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Madoff Trustee Changing Market-Maker Business Sale 
The trustee for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc. agreed to modify the contract with Castor Pollux Securities
LLC, which purchased the Madoff market-making business in June
2009 for $1 million cash plus as much as another $24.5 million
based on gross revenue through December 2013. Without modifying
the contract, the trustee said in his March 30 bankruptcy court
filing that Castor Pollux, now formally named Surge Trading
Inc., would go out of business. 
So far, Surge has paid the upfront price plus $3.39 million
on the earnout. Surge's problems arise from the remainder of the
earnout that represents a contingent liability precluding the
company from compliance with net capital requirements and
blocking the auditor from certifying the 2009 financial
statements. 
To solve the problem, the Madoff trustee agreed that Surge
could transfer the business to a newly formed subsidiary not
directly liable for the earnout. The trustee said he negotiated
provisions in the agreement "to mitigate" the possibly of not
being paid. 
The agreement will come to bankruptcy court for approval at
an April 16 hearing. 
The Madoff firm began liquidating in December 2008 with the
appointment of a trustee under the SIPA. Madoff himself went
into an involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation in April. His
bankruptcy case was consolidated with the firm's liquidation. 
The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection
Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc., 08-01789,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District New York (Manhattan).
The criminal case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-cr-00213, U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
BankUnited Wants Exclusivity until Tax Return Filed 
BankUnited Financial Corp., the holding company whose bank
was taken over and sold by regulators in May, is proposing a
novel approach for a deadline on the exclusive right to propose
a Chapter 11 plan. 
BankUnited says that tax attributes are among the "most
valuable assets." The holding company is currently in the
process of selecting tax advisers to prepare the return for the
period ended in September. 
The tax attributes include net operating loss carrybacks,
refund rights and loss carryforwards. 
BankUnited says that a plan can't be worked out until there
is a good picture of the tax situation. Therefore, the holding
company wants so-called exclusivity extended until 90 days after
the tax return is filed. 
A major issue in the case is the $4.9 billion claim filed
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver for the
failed bank subsidiary. While BankUnited believes a
"substantial portion" of the claim is "simply invalid,"
leaving the claim untouched would "dominate the distribution
scheme under any plan and significantly dilute the return
available to other creditors." 
BankUnited filed lists of assets and creditors, showing
$557 million owing to unsecured creditors. There are no secured
claims. Assets were listed for $21 million. 
The bank's failure cost the FDIC $4.9 billion. It had
deposits of $8.6 billion and $12.8 billion in assets. Debt of
the Coral Gables, Florida-based holding company includes $120
million on convertible senior notes, $12.5 million of junior
subordinated debentures, $184 million in mandatorily convertible
senior notes known as HiMeds, and $237 million in trust
preferred securities. 
The case is In re BankUnited Financial Corp., 09-19940,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District Florida (Miami). 
Control of W Hotel Union Square Thrown into Doubt 
Whether one of three mezzanine lenders to the W New York
Union Square hotel had the right to file a Chapter 11 petition
on March 23 was thrown into doubt yesterday in a lawsuit filed
in bankruptcy court by Union Square Real Holding Corp., the new
owner of a mezzanine loan on the hotel. 
In the complaint, USRHC is asking the bankruptcy judge to
prevent the bankrupt mezzanine lender, Hotels Union Square Mezz
1 LLC, from putting the hotel itself into Chapter 11. 
USRHC explains in the complaint how the $285 million
acquisition of the hotel in October 2006 was financed by a $115
million first mortgage, three mezzanine loans totaling $117
million, and a $53 million equity investment by an affiliate of
Dubai World. 
USRHC spent $3.6 million on March 9 to buy a second $37
million mezzanine loan. USRHC made the new investment to protect
its $53 million investment in the hotel. 
Exercising rights under a pledge agreement, USRHC alleges
that on March 22 it removed all of the officers of Hotels Union
Square Mezz 1 LLC. Nonetheless, according to the complaint, the
incumbent officers went ahead and authorized the Chapter 11
filing on March 23. 
The complaint says that Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC has
a pledge of the ownership interest in the hotel itself. USRHC
said it will ask the bankruptcy judge to block a Chapter 11
filing for the hotel itself. 
A date for a hearing on a motion for a temporary injunction
hadn't been set by yesterday afternoon. HSRHC wants to prevent a
bankruptcy by the hotel to fend off a default on the $115
million first mortgage which is current. USRHC says income is
sufficient to pay operating expenses and debt service the first
mortgage. 
The case is In re Hotels Union Square Mezz 1 LLC, 10-10971,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Neenah Submits Plan Negotiated Before February Filing 
Neenah Foundry Co., a producer of cast-iron products such
as manhole covers and sewer grates, filed a reorganization plan
and explanatory disclosure statement designed to bring
conclusion to the second venture into Chapter 11. 
Neenah filed under Chapter 11 on Feb. 3 after hashing out
agreement on a plan with holders of 55 percent of secured notes
and all the subordinated notes. 
The hearing for approval of the disclosure statement is
scheduled for April 27. 
The plan would exchange the $237.5 million outstanding on
9.5 percent senior secured notes for 97 percent of the new stock
plus a new $50 million secured loan. Tontine Capital Partners
LP, the controlling shareholder and holder of the $88.7 million
in 12.5 percent senior subordinated notes, is to have 3 percent
of the new equity plus warrants to purchase 10 percent. 
The draft disclosure statement has blanks where senior and
subordinated creditors ultimately will be told the predicted
percentage recovery. 
The $55.2 million secured working capital loan is to be
paid in full or reinstated. 
Trade suppliers are to be paid in full. The petition listed
assets of $287 million against debt totaling $449.1 million. 
Neenah was in Chapter 11 before. The company confirmed a
prepackaged plan in September 2003 that had been filed the
previous month. The plan exchanged senior subordinated notes for
$100 million in new subordinated debt, $30 million cash and half
of the stock. Trade creditors were paid in full. 
Neenah, from a Wisconsin town of the same name, reported a
$150 million net loss for the Sept. 30 fiscal year on net sales
of $333 million. In fiscal 2008, net sales were $511 million,
and the net loss was $12 million. 
The case is In re Neenah Enterprises Inc., 10-10360, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Lake at Las Vegas Scheduled for June 21 Confirmation 
Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture LLC scheduled a June 21
confirmation hearing for approval of the Chapter 11 plan when
the bankruptcy judge this week approved the explanatory
disclosure statement. 
The committee representing unsecured creditors supports the
plan following an agreement with secured lenders owed $626
million. The committee believes that the plan has a better
outcome than success in a lawsuit against the lenders. 
The plan for the master developer of the Lake Las Vegas
Resort 17 miles from the Las Vegas Strip allows a lawsuit go to
forward against Sid Bass, Lee Bass and other former owners of
the project. Creditors drop the suit the committee began in July
against an affiliate of Credit Suisse Group AG, which was a
secured lender and agent for the secured creditors. 
The plan is to convert the secured lenders' $127 million
loan for the reorganization into 94 percent of the new equity.
For their more than $627 million in pre-bankruptcy secured
claims, the lenders will take 1 percent of the new equity,
warrants that currently would have no value, and 80 percent of
net recoveries from the lawsuit against the insiders. 
Unsecured creditors are expected to recover 4.5 percent
from a $1 million cash fund plus 20 percent of lawsuit
recoveries. 
Lot owners will waive claims in return for remapping
properties so they will have marketable title. 
The disclosure statement says that the plan is better for
unsecured creditors than victory in the lawsuit because the
creditors find no defects in the $127 million secured claim
financing the reorganization. The disclosure statement says that
the property is not worth enough to pay off the so-called DIP
loan. 
The suit contended that the loan from Credit Suisse in 2004
was a fraudulent transfer because all but $100 million from the
$560 million loan went directly to the owners. 
The formal lists of assets and liabilities showed $719
million in claims belonging to secured creditors, with the first
mortgage totaling $671 million. 
The development is a 3,600-acre master-planned community
with a 320-acre man-made lake next to the Lake Mead National
Recreational Area. It has three golf course, two hotels, a
casino, retail stores and more than 1,600 completed residential
units. The Chapter 11 filing was in July 2008. 
The case is Lake at Las Vegas Joint Venture LLC, 08-17814,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). 
Hawaii Medical Taps Gemino for Possible Financing 
Hawaii Medical Center LLC, the operator of two hospitals in
Honolulu, filed a motion on March 30 along with the creditors'
committee for authority to pay $75,000 in fees so Gemino
Healthcare Finance LLC will undertake the financial
investigation necessary to commit to provide $10 million in
financing for the hospitals' reorganization plan. 
Three plans have been competing for the right to reorganize
the hospitals. The bankruptcy judge already approved a
disclosure statement explaining the Chapter 11 plan proposed by
St. Francis Healthcare System of Hawaii. The St. Francis plan is
scheduled for a May 24 confirmation hearing. 
The bankruptcy judge has yet to give formal approval for
the disclosure statements accompanying the plans proposed by the
hospitals and the official creditors' committee. 
The hospitals say they need financing from Gemino to be in
place by May 23 so their plan could be confirmed instead of the
St. Francis plan on May 24. 
The hospitals originally filed for Chapter 11
reorganization in Delaware in August 2008. The cases were moved
to Hawaii in September 2008. The hospitals have 342 beds in
total. 
The case is CHA Hawaii LLC, 08-01369, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Hawaii (Honolulu). 
New Filings 
Medical Imaging Developer Eigen Files in Delaware 
Eigen Inc., a developer of technology to view and biopsy
prostate glands using three-dimensional ultrasound, filed a
Chapter 11 petition on March 30 in Delaware. 
The Grass Valley, California-based company owes more than
$20 million to the secured lender Kazi Management IV LLC.
Unsecured creditors are owed $1 million, with half representing
a claim held by General Electric Capital Corp. 
Before bankruptcy, Kazi was foreclosing. The foreclosure
was enjoined by a state court in California by former employees,
bankruptcy court papers say. 
Kazi is providing $2 million of new money financing for the
Chapter 11 case. 
The case is In re Eigen Inc., 10-11061, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
U.S. to Help Grant Forest Sale to Georgia-Pacific 
Grant Forest Products Inc., a Canada-based producer of
oriented strand board, filed a Chapter 15 petition late
yesterday in Delaware for protection from creditors in the U.S. 
Grant filed for reorganization in Ontario Superior Court in
June. The company has plants in Ontario, Alberta and South
Carolina. 
The petition said assets and debt both exceed $500 million.
Debt includes $398 million on first-lien obligations and $150
million on second-lien claims. 
The court in Canada already approved a sale of assets to
Georgia-Pacific LLC. The Chapter 15 case in part would assist in
implementation of the sale. 
If the bankruptcy judge in Delaware concludes that Canada
is home to the "foreign main proceeding," he will permanently
halt creditor actions in the U.S. and assist in implementation
of the Canadian reorganization. Most unsecured creditors in the
U.S. are not to be affected by the reorganization. 
The case is In re Grant Forest Products Inc., 10-11132,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). 
Watch List 
Oil Producer Petroflow Has Problems with Lenders 
Petroflow Energy Ltd., an oil and natural gas production
company from Denver, was unable to sell the Oklahoma properties
by March 7. As a result, a forbearance agreement ended with bank
lenders, the company said in a statement yesterday. 
As a result, the banks terminated Petroflow's hedging
positions, generating $4.75 million that paid down the bank debt
to $98.75 million. The company said that the banks took
operational control of the primary operating accounts. 
Compounding the problems, Petroflow said a farmout
agreement was terminated for an alleged default. As a result,
purchasers are holding back payments, and liens have been placed
against the wells. 
Petroflow has yet to file audited financial statements for
2008 and 2009. The company said in the statement that the new
auditors expect to complete the filings in Canada by April 9. 
Petroflow said there is no assurance it can continue as a
going concern. 
The closing high for Petroflow's stock in the last two
years was $9.11 on June 17, 2008. In trading yesterday before
the announcement, the stock was above 26 cents. After the
announcement, the stock traded as low as 19 cents and closed at
22 cents, down 5 cents for the day.

Pfizer Inc. agreed to pay about
$400,000 to settle a lawsuit mid-trial that blamed its Neurontin
epilepsy medicine for helping cause a Massachusetts man&#8217;s
suicide, two people familiar with the accord said. 
It&#8217;s the first settlement over a Neurontin-related suicide
claim. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, agreed yesterday
to resolve allegations by Hartley Shearer&#8217;s family in Boston
federal court that its Warner-Lambert unit knew the drug posed a
suicide risk and failed to disclose it to patients and doctors. 
&#8220;Pfizer agreed to settle the case for less than its
defense costs remaining in this case,&#8221; said Rob Haralson, a
spokesman for New York-based Pfizer. &#8220;Pfizer maintains that it
has strong defenses to each of plaintiff&#8217;s claims.&#8221; 
Pfizer faces more than 1,000 lawsuits accusing it of
illegally promoting Neurontin for unapproved uses and helping to
cause some users&#8217; suicides. The settlement comes a week after
another Boston jury ordered Pfizer to pay more than $140 million
in damages to an insurer over the drug. Pfizer has denied any
wrongdoing in connection with its handling of Neurontin. 
Its Warner-Lambert subsidiary pleaded guilty in 2004 to
criminal charges filed by the Justice Department in connection
with allegations it illegally marketed Neurontin and paid a
$430 million fine. Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000. 
For 16 Months 
The 57-year-old Shearer, a part-time lecturer at Williams
College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, took Neurontin for 16
months before killing himself, according to court filings. 
Shearer&#8217;s family contends his doctor wasn&#8217;t aware of
Neurontin&#8217;s suicide risk when he prescribed the drug to help
deal with pain generated by a 1999 stroke. 
Pfizer argued Shearer battled depression for most of his
life and was taking a dozen prescription drugs, including an
anti-depressant, when he shot himself to death with a .357
Magnum handgun in 2002. 
The drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers also noted Shearer argued with his
wife the day he killed himself and left a suicide note saying it
was the last time she would &#8220;leave me powerless.&#8221; 
Ron Rosenkranz, a lawyer for the Shearers, declined to
comment when contacted yesterday evening. Today, he told U.S.
District Judge William G. Young at a hearing in Boston that the
&#8220;amount of the settlement, while confidential, is substantially
less than the amount reported.&#8221; 
&#8216;An Iffy Case&#8217; 
&#8220;This is an iffy case,&#8221; Young told jurors after
announcing the accord. &#8220;This is why they settled. Iffy on both
sides.&#8221; The people who said the settlement was about $400,000
declined to be identified because the terms are confidential. 
By prescribing Neurontin as a painkiller, Shearer&#8217;s doctor
was recommending a so-called off-label use of the drug. While
doctors may prescribe a medicine for uses not approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, companies are barred from
promoting products for off-label uses. 
Dr. Charles King, a former Harvard University business
professor, told jurors in the Shearer case yesterday that
Warner-Lambert officials used illegal off-label marketing
tactics to turn Neurontin into a &#8220;blockbuster drug.&#8221; 
&#8220;They took a drug that was expected to generate
$500 million over its lifetime and turned it into a drug that
sold roughly $10 billion,&#8221; said King, an economist who
testified for the Shearers as an expert on pharmaceutical-
industry marketing practices. 
The Shearer suit was the second product-liability case over
Neurontin to go to trial. 
In July 2009, a Peabody, Massachusetts, family dropped its
suit over the suicide of a woman who was taking the drug. The
family was in the second day of trial in federal court in Boston
when it decided to dismiss the case. 
Misleading Doctors 
Another jury in Boston&#8217;s federal court March 25 said Pfizer
must pay Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. $47.4 million for
misleading doctors on whether Neurontin was effective for
illnesses such as migraines and bipolar disorder. 
The jury found the drugmaker violated the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, and
California&#8217;s Unfair Competition Law. 
The Oakland, California-based insurer is a unit of Kaiser
Permanente, the largest U.S. nonprofit health maintenance
organization. Under RICO, the amount of actual damages will be
tripled to $142.1 million. 
Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $120 billion in 2000 and
Pharmacia for $54 billion three years later. 
$430 Million Settlement 
Along with the $430 million settlement of allegations over
Neurontin, Pfizer also paid $2.3 billion in October 2009 to
resolve U.S. Justice Department allegations it illegally
marketed the painkiller Bextra and three other drugs. 
&#8220;When you acquire Warner-Lambert you get Neurontin, and
when you acquire Pharmacia you get Bextra, and some of these
problems came with the acquisitions,&#8221; Jeffrey Kindler, Pfizer&#8217;s
chief executive officer told the New York Times March 31. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t change the facts or our responsibility for them.&#8221; 
The Shearer case is Shearer v. Pfizer Inc., 07-cv-11428-

A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. buyout
firm bought a minority stake in David Ganek&#8217;s $4 billion Level
Global Investors LP, adding a hedge fund that can bet on rising
as well as falling stock prices globally. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Petershill Fund Offshore LP, a $1 billion
fund set up to buy minority stakes in hedge funds, won&#8217;t get any
management or investment decision-making role with the
acquisition, according to a letter Ganek sent to clients
yesterday. New York-based Level Global said it will use the
proceeds from the sale to help attract and retain top talent. 
&#8220;We believe this investment by Petershill is an important
milestone in the continued development of Level Global&#8217;s
investment management platform as an institutional quality
business,&#8221; Ganek and managing partner Anthony Chiasson said in
the letter, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Ganek, an alumnus of Steven A. Cohen&#8217;s Stamford,
Connecticut-based SAC Capital Advisors LLC, founded Level Global
in 2003. The firm has 64 employees, of which 25 are investment
professionals. Petershill has interests in three London-based
funds, Capula Investment Management LLP, Winton Capital
Management Ltd. and Trafalgar Asset Managers Ltd., as well as in
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Shumway Capital Partners LLC. 
Andy Merrill, a spokesman for Level Global, and Melissa
Daly, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment. 
Hedge funds are loosely regulated private partnerships that

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. aren't doing "God's work" when it comes
to derivatives, according to investor groups of nuns and
priests. 
Shareholders will vote starting this month on proposals
sponsored by the Sisters of Charity of Saint Elizabeth and 14
other religious organizations, asking Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan,
Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to give more
information on the collateral used in their derivatives trading. 
It's the first time the four banks, among the largest U.S.
swaps dealers, will put to a nonbinding vote a call to explain
how collateral of derivatives customers is used and to keep it
from other accounts. Congress is considering bills that would
require more derivatives deals be processed through
clearinghouses, privately owned third parties that guarantee
transactions and keep track of collateral and margin. 
"The use of these instruments, if they're not disclosed by
the dealers and the information made available, by their very
nature can contribute to systemic risk," said Father Seamus
Finn, a director with the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate
in Washington, D.C., one of the co-sponsors of the resolutions. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in February
and March decisions, backed the religious groups' bid to put the
proposal up for a vote by shareholders of JPMorgan, Bank of
America and Citigroup. New York-based Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, agreed separately to add
the resolution to its proxy statement. 
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein's
remark in November that he's a banker doing "God's work" was
an "inscrutable comment," Finn said. "He was part of a group
of very senior people from the banking sector who appeared to
have been advised by their PR people to acknowledge their
mistakes but more pointedly assert the uprightness of their
intentions." 
The ICCR 
Blankfein, 55, didn't mean for the remark to be taken
seriously, Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag said that
month. 
The religious groups, members of the Interfaith Center on
Corporate Responsibility, hold shares in the four banks ranging
from 100 at Goldman Sachs to 63,977 at Citigroup. The New York-
based ICCR's 300 members include money managers for various
religious organizations, including Jewish and Buddhist, and
pension and mutual funds that oversee $100 billion in assets,
according to the organization's Web site. 
"The immorality of the financial crisis is rooted in the
fact that these derivatives contracts weren't based on creating
value and didn't create incentives for people to keep their
promises," said Laura Berry, a former large-cap portfolio
manager for Citigroup who is executive director of the ICCR,
which is coordinating the proxy votes for the religious groups. 
200 Proposals 
ICCR's members have placed 200 social and environmental
measures on proxy ballots this year, including the use of
antibiotics in animal feed at Tyson Foods Inc. and carbon
emissions at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Berry said. The organization
filed its first shareholder resolution in 1971, pressuring
General Motors Corp. to divest from South Africa because of what
was then the country's apartheid policy of racial segregation. 
"They do very good work," said Charles Elson, director of
the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the
University of Delaware. "I don't always agree with them, but
some of the stuff they've done is quite good." 
JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and
Morgan Stanley were parties to 96 percent of the $293 trillion
in over-the-counter derivatives trades made by the top 25 U.S.
bank-holding companies as of Dec. 31, according to the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency. The religious groups didn't
seek to place a resolution on Morgan Stanley's proxy because
none have held the bank's shares long enough, said Finn. 
Banks Say Reject 
The religious organizations want the four broker-dealers to
disclose internal policies on how the collateral posted by
derivatives customers is used. They're also asking the lenders
to segregate the collateral from other accounts, which would
prohibit it from being used for anything else. 
"We were very much concerned about where's the collateral,
is this all recorded, do we know who the second or third party
is to this, the counterparties and so on," said Sister Barbara
Aires, coordinator of corporate responsibility at the Sisters of
Charity of Saint Elizabeth, in Convent Station, New Jersey. 
The banks have urged shareholders in their proxy
statements to reject the proposal. JPMorgan said that
segregating assets could expose it to price volatility and
potential losses "when the firm needs to liquidate collateral
quickly upon a default." 
JPMorgan spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli, Goldman Sachs
spokesman Michael DuVally, Bank of America spokesman Scott
Silvestri and Citigroup spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to
comment beyond the companies' proxy statements. 
Proposals focusing on specific business issues like
derivatives trading "tend not to do well" in shareholder
votes, said Elson. "They're really issues of the board. But in
this climate, you can't say anything is for sure."

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and other banks objected to
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s plan to build its real estate
unit into an asset-management business. 
The business would be &#8220;a reorganization plan for debtors&#8217;
employees and management separate, apart and ahead of the
reorganization plan for creditors,&#8221; the banks said yesterday in
a court filing. 
A unit called Lamco, staffed by current employees and
managers, would run the defunct investment bank&#8217;s real estate
and private-equity assets, also taking on business from outside,
Lehman said in March. 
The Lehman parent would have sole control and ownership of
the assets, denying &#8220;any governance or ownership interest&#8221; to
affiliates that helped to fund Lamco, or to creditors, the banks
said. They described the proposed Lamco deal as an &#8220;insider
transaction,&#8221; not an &#8220;arms-length sale.&#8221; 
The objection was filed by seven banks and two investment
companies that are derivatives creditors of a Lehman affiliate,
including Merrill Lynch  Co., its parent Bank of America Corp.
and Deutsche Bank AG. By putting Lehman managers and employees
ahead of creditors, Lamco would turn the Chapter 11
reorganization &#8220;on its head,&#8221; they said. 
Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment. 
Lehman&#8217;s U.K. units objected to the plan in a separate
filing, saying Lehman hadn&#8217;t provided enough information to
assess its merits. 
A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for April 14 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.

The banks said the planned business would be "a

Microsoft Corp. failed to persuade a
U.S. appeals court to take a second look at a patent-
infringement case that forced it to change the company's popular
Word software and resulted in a damage award that has grown to
more than $290 million. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April
1 rejected a request that the Dec. 22 ruling won by closely held
I4i LP of Toronto be heard by the full 12-member court. The
decision was announced in a notice on the court's Web site. 
Microsoft has called the case the largest patent-
infringement verdict ever upheld on appeal. The request for a
rehearing centered on testimony related to damages, whether
Microsoft's infringement was intentional, and whether Microsoft
should have been forced to remove what the company called an
"obscure functionality" or stop selling Word. 
I4i's invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. Microsoft issued an update to Word to comply
with the court order. 
Word is part of Microsoft's Office software, used by more
than 500 million people. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
testing Office 2010 with customers. The completed version is
scheduled to be released by June. The unit that sells Office is
Microsoft's biggest, with $18.9 billion in sales in the year
ended June 30. 
XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it's used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. I4i's patent was issued in 1998. 
The case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). 
Amazon.com Gets U.S. Patent for Order Tracking by Video 
Amazon.com Inc., the largest online retailer, received a
patent for video tracking of order processing. 
Patent 7,689,465, issued March 30, covers the capture of
images of an order being processed, and the sending of those
images to the customer. 
The technology can also be used to notify third parties,
who pay to have their promotional material included in a
shipment, according to the patent. A customer will be able to
see her own name and address put on the order, and what is
included in the order, before it is shipped. 
The invention also may be used to verify customer
complaints about an order, according to the patent. 
Amazon applied for the patent in March 2005 with assistance
from Meyertons, Hood, Kivlin, Kowert  Goetzel PC of Austin,
Texas. 
New Zealand Lawmakers Propose Barring Software Patents 
New Zealand lawmakers are considering changing that
country's patent code to outlaw software patents. 
Parliament's Commerce Select Committee made its final
recommendation in a 197-page report released at the end of
March. 
The committee said the patenting of software is
"inconsistent" with the open-source model. Permitting software
patents would "stifle innovation and competition," the
committee said in its report. 
The report noted that the issue of embedded software is
problematic and urged the Intellectual Property Office of New
Zealand to develop guidelines for inventions containing embedded
software. 
In addition to software, the new law would ban the
patenting of plant varieties, human beings and biological
processes for their generation, methods of treating humans by
surgery and therapy, and methods of diagnosis practiced on human
beings. 
New Zealand's present patent law, enacted in 1953, was
based on a 1949 U.K. patent bill that has since been repealed. 
Existing New Zealand patent law "has a low threshold for
patentability compared with most other countries," according to
the committee's report. This low threshold "can lead to broader
patent rights" in New Zealand than in other countries. 
As a result, technology that may be freely available in
other countries may be protected by patents in New Zealand.
Lawmakers said this has the potential to discourage innovation
and inhibit growth in productivity and exports.

EBay Wins Tiffany Trademark Appeal, Faces Ad Claim 
EBay Inc. didn't infringe Tiffany  Co.'s trademark because
of fake goods sold on its Web site, an appeals court ruled,
while returning Tiffany's lawsuit to the trial court for further
action on a false-advertising claim. 
EBay's ads promoting Tiffany merchandise may be misleading
and in violation of federal law, the New York-based appeals
court said April 1. 
"The law prohibits an advertisement that implies that all
of the goods offered on a defendant's Web site are genuine when,
in fact, as here, a sizeable portion of them are not," a three-
judge panel wrote. 
The ruling may force EBay to change its advertising policy
to include disclaimers that some trademark goods, like Tiffany
jewelry, may be counterfeit. The judges said they "rather doubt
that the consequences will be so dire" that advertising will be
deterred because sellers can't confirm the authenticity of goods
for sale as EBay maintained. 
Tiffany said in a statement that it is "very
disappointed" by the ruling and considering an appeal. 
"EBay knew that counterfeit merchandise was being sold on
its site -- and EBay took no effective steps to stop it,"
Tiffany Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Kowalski said in the
statement. "EBay deliberately misled consumers for profit, and
unfortunately the court has justified its actions." 
Tiffany, based in New York, and other retailers have said
online sales of fake brands of clothes, bags and jewelry cost
the industry about $30 billion a year. EBay, the most-visited
U.S. e-commerce site, said the ruling validates its "leading
efforts to fight counterfeiting." 
"We continue to support cooperation, rather than
litigation, as the best way to address these issues in
everyone's best interests," Michael R. Jacobson, general
counsel of the San Jose, California-based company, said in a
statement, predicting an EBay victory on the false-ad claim. 
The case is Tiffany v. EBay, 08-3947, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).

Boeing Ready With Tanker Bid, Has Trademark Application 
Boeing Co., whose quest to gain the U.S. Air Force's $35
billion air-tanker contract was set back with the extension of
the bidding deadline to July 9, already has a pending
application for a trademark for the aircraft. 
Chicago-based Boeing, which is presently the only known
bidder for the contract, applied to register "KC-767" as a
trademark in March 2006, according to the database of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. The mark is to be used for
aircraft, Boeing said in its application. 
According to the designations-systems.net Web site, the Air
Force approved the KC-767 in September 2002 for a Boeing tanker
based on its 767 aircraft. Boeing is the maker of the KC-135
tanker the Air Force first ordered in 1954, which the new tanker
is intended to replace. 
The Department of Defense said March 31 it was extending
the bidding deadline to July 9 if the European Aeronautic
Defence and Space Co. decides to submit a bid. Netherlands-based
EADS asked for an extension after partner Northrop Grumman Corp.
dropped out of the competition on March 8, saying the bidding
contest favored the Boeing aircraft. 
Knoll Settles 'Barcelona' Trademark Dispute with Alphaville 
Knoll Inc., a maker of office furniture, settled a
trademark dispute with Alphaville Design Inc., according to a
company statement. 
Alphaville, a furniture wholesaler based in Fremont,
California, sued Knoll in federal court in San Francisco in
November 2007, seeking a declaration it wasn't infringing the
"Barcelona" trademarks used for furniture designed by Mies van
der Rohe. 
The California company claimed Knoll's trademarks were
invalid. In settling the dispute, Alphaville and its owners
acknowledged the validity of the trademarks and Knoll's rights
to them. 
In return, East Greenville, Pennsylvania-based Knoll
granted Alphaville the right to sell similar products for a
limited amount of time, according to the statement. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel signed the dismissal
order on March 29. No damages, litigation costs or attorney fees
were awarded to either party, according to the order. 
The case is Alphaville Design Inc., v. Knoll Inc. 3:07-cv-
0569-MHP, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco).

General Motors Co., the largest U.S.
automaker, said it will wind down its Hummer brand and is
offering rebates of as much as $6,000 to sell remaining sport-
utility vehicles. 
Jim Bunnell, GM's general director for dealer network
support, told retailers in conference call at 11:45 a.m. Detroit
time that they will get letters within days about ending their
franchises, Nick Richards, a company spokesman, said in an
interview. 
Shedding Hummer was part of GM's plan to pare its U.S.
brands to four from eight after bankruptcy. GM has sold one of
the four brands it explored selling. 
"Anyone who buys it needs cash to make it work," said Jim
Hall, principal of 2953 Analytics, a consulting firm in
Birmingham, Michigan. "That's why GM has been turning buyers
away left, right and center." 
GM is winding down Saturn after a planned sale to Penske
Automotive Group Inc. fell through in September. It reversed
plans to sell its European Opel unit to Canadian supplier Magna
International Inc. in November. Detroit-based GM sold Saab in
February only after two attempts to sell the Swedish carmaker
failed. Pontiac is also being closed.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
energy company, said it never deliberately underpaid royalties
on natural gas pumped on federal and American Indian land. 
The U.S. Justice Department yesterday announced that Exxon
agreed to pay $32.2 million to resolve violations of the False
Claims Act committed between March 1988 and November 1999. Mobil
Corp., which was acquired by Exxon in December 1999,
"systematically underreported" the value of gas extracted from
the leases and "knowingly" underpaid what it owed, the
department said in a statement. 
"We reject any accusation that the company deliberately
under-reported the value of the natural gas," David Eglinton, a
spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mailed
statement. "The settlement agreement in this case, signed by
the government, expressly denies any knowing under-reporting
with respect to royalty." 
Eglinton said the agreement was signed in 2008. The Justice
Department's statement didn't explain why it waited until now to
announce the settlement. 
The amount Exxon agreed to pay is equivalent to less than
one hour of the company's sales. 
The agreement stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Harold Wright
under the provisions of the federal whistleblower statute that
allows private citizens to file actions on behalf of the
government and share in any recovery. Because Wright is deceased,
his heirs will receive $975,000, the Justice Department said. 
Other energy companies that previously settled similar
cases with the government include Burlington Resources Inc.,
which is now part of ConocoPhillips, Chevron Corp. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, the department said. 
The dispute centered on whether the energy companies could
deduct costs such as pipeline fees from the value of the gas.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. has almost
doubled the number of its Tokyo commodity traders to meet demand
from utilities seeking to use coal-derivatives to hedge against
price swings, said a person with knowledge of the expansion. 
The second-biggest U.S. bank has increased the headcount to
around 10 in the last 18 months, in part to meet the needs of
utilities such as Chubu Electric Power Co. and J-Power, the
country&#8217;s biggest power wholesaler, said the person, who
declined to be named because the information is private. 
JPMorgan joins Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc in
boosting sales of swaps and other products to help Japanese
utilities mitigate risk from volatile fuel costs. J-Power&#8217;s
profit dropped by a third in fiscal 2008 and Chubu posted a loss
after benchmark Australian power-station coal prices rose to a
record in July then fell 61 percent five months later. 
&#8220;Utilities&#8217; hedging needs have grown rapidly over the past
few years as physical coal prices became more volatile,&#8221; said
Ken Hasegawa, the energy team manager at broker Newedge in Tokyo.
&#8220;The question is whether other power companies will follow
suit.&#8221; 
Mika Nemoto, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Securities Japan
Co., declined to comment. 
J-Power, officially known as Electric Power Development Co.,
hired Barclays commodities banker Toyohiko Kuroda last year to
bolster management of risks associated with coal procurement,
Masato Uchiyama, director of the utility&#8217;s energy business
division, said in an interview on April 6. 
Coal Swaps 
The utility, which buys 20 million metric tons of coal
annually, transacts coal swaps for part of that total to hedge
against price fluctuations, said Uchiyama, 54. 
Swaps allow utilities to pay a fixed price for coal while
another party, usually a bank, pays a floating price, based on
market benchmarks. If the benchmark goes up during the term of
the contract, the utility gets a payment from the bank, and if
it goes down, the utility pays. 
Nagoya-based Chubu Electric transacted 15 million tons
worth of over-the-counter coal swaps free on board at
Australia&#8217;s Newcastle port in the year ended March 31 after
forming an alliance with a unit of Electricite de France SA in
2007, said Yoshio Komura, director of Chubu&#8217;s trading unit. 
Japan&#8217;s third-biggest generator formed Chubu Energy Trading
Inc. in 2007 to procure the fuel for resale to other users in
Asia and trade derivatives, Komura said. 
Spot power-station coal prices at Newcastle, the world&#8217;s
largest export harbor for the fuel, retreated to an average
$71.71 a ton in 2009 from $129.02 the previous year as the
global economic recession eroded demand. Prices climbed to a
record $192.50 in July before plunging to $75.25 in Dec. 5, 2008.
Coal gained 14 cents to $94.98 a ton in the week ended April 3,
according to the globalCOAL NEWC Index. 
Japan, the world&#8217;s biggest power-station coal importer in
2009, ships in about 92 million tons annually. Australian
suppliers led by Xstrata Plc and Rio Tinto Plc account for more
than half while Indonesia, the second-biggest supplier, provides
about 20 percent, according to the finance ministry.

Ali Hedayat, co-head in the Americas
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s largest internal hedge fund, has
left the firm, the second senior departure from the unit in less
than a month, said three people familiar with the matter. 
Hedayat&#8217;s departure follows last month&#8217;s exit by Pierre
Henri Flamand, who ran the Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies
division from London. Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
in New York, declined to comment. Hedayat, 35, who was promoted
to managing director in October 2006, also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, generates about 10 percent of its revenue from
proprietary trading, or bets with the firm&#8217;s own money, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar has said. Goldman Sachs Principal
Strategies, a unit within the firm&#8217;s equities division,
rebounded from losses in 2008 to fuel the firm&#8217;s 7 percent gain
in equity revenue to $9.89 billion in 2009, according to the
company&#8217;s earnings report in January. 
Principal strategies seeks to profit from discrepancies in
relative values of financial instruments, convertible bonds and
&#8220;various types of volatility trading,&#8221; according to the
report. In early 2008, a group of traders from principal
strategies led by Raanan Agus and Kenneth Ebert created a $7
billion hedge fund called Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and
became part of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. 
Flamand, 39, is setting up his own hedge fund and a Goldman
Sachs executive in London said last month that the firm supports
Flamand&#8217;s plan. 
Hedayat, who graduated from McGill University in Montreal
in 1996 with a double major in finance and economics, started at
Goldman Sachs in 1997 as a financial analyst covering Latin
American markets. He joined the principal strategies group in
2000 and moved to the London office in 2002, before returning to
New York in 2007.

International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, is offering
financing to partners of Sun Microsystems Inc., the server-
computer maker acquired by IBM rival Oracle Corp. this year. 
As much as $500 million will be available for Sun partners
who switch to selling IBM systems -- integrated servers,
software and storage -- to their clients, Armonk, New York-based
IBM said today in a statement. 
IBM has won over some Sun resellers and is trying to get
more with the financing perk, said Bernie Spang, IBM&#8217;s director
of strategy for information-management software. The company had
sought to buy Sun last year, according to people familiar with
the matter. That bid dissolved after the companies disagreed on
price and terms. 
&#8220;The goal of this effort is to sweeten the pot,&#8221; Spang
said. 
Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. The company completed its purchase
of Sun in January for about $7.4 billion. IBM trails Microsoft
Corp. and Oracle in software sales. 
IBM also unveiled a new system that helps analyze data 20
times faster for industries such as finance and health care.
Last quarter, the company introduced its new Power7 systems,
which are tailored for specific projects. 
IBM rose 8 cents to $129.01 at 2:14 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had fallen 1.5 percent
this year before today.

positions were not a &#8216;bet against&#8217; our clients,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn wrote
in a letter introducing the firm&#8217;s annual report. 
Goldman Sachs has been criticized for its role in the
subprime mortgage-securities market and as a trading partner to
American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out by the
U.S. government. Harris Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate
reputations found that 60 percent of respondents gave Goldman
Sachs negative ratings for &#8220;ethical standards.&#8221; Only AIG,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac scored lower. 
Goldman Sachs posted $11.6 billion profit for fiscal 2007,
a record at the time, aided by bets that the subprime mortgage
market would decline even as clients continued to purchase the
securities. U.S. home prices have slumped 28 percent from their
all-time high in July 2006, spurring the worst recession since
the 1930s. 
&#8220;The firm did not generate enormous net revenues or
profits by betting against residential mortgage-related
products,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote. &#8220;Our relatively early
risk reduction resulted in our losing less money than we
otherwise would have when the residential housing market began
to deteriorate rapidly.&#8221; 
Taxpayer Aid 
The New York-based firm received $10 billion of taxpayer
aid in the credit crisis, which it repaid in June. That money
led politicians and pundits to blame Goldman Sachs for profiting
from taxpayers. Labor unions led protests calling for bonus
payments to be canceled, and a Rolling Stone magazine writer
last year labeled the firm a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity&#8221; and criticized it for selling
securities backed by subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs is grateful for the indispensible role
governments played and we recognize that our firm and our
shareholders benefitted from it,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote.
&#8220;It is impossible to know what would have happened to the
financial system absent concerted government action around the
world.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said AIG&#8217;s bailout in 2008 helped the bank
and every other financial institution, because the insurer&#8217;s
collapse would have been &#8220;extremely&#8221; disruptive to financial
markets, Blankfein said. 
The $182.3 billion bailout ensured that Goldman Sachs and
other counterparties were repaid in full. Much of the $12.9
billion Goldman Sachs received from the insurer&#8217;s rescue was
paid out to meet AIG-related &#8216;obligations,&#8221; the firm said. 
Goldman Sachs had &#8220;minimal&#8221; economic exposure to AIG
after it demanded collateral and insured against a default
through the credit default swaps market, Blankfein said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s railway fund
is betting on U.S. freight companies such as Union Pacific Corp.,
CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., following Warren Buffett&#8217;s
decision to take over Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. 
The 138 billion yen ($1.5 billion) JPM Global Railway Stock
Fund expects the companies to benefit from a move to carrying
goods by rail instead of roads to reduce fuel costs and
pollution, said Peter Kirkman, the fund&#8217;s lead portfolio manager.
Railroads burn less diesel than trucks for each ton of cargo
carried, giving operators a fuel-efficiency advantage. 
&#8220;Government policy will continue to move toward
environmental concerns,&#8221; Kirkman, who works for J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc., said in a telephone interview from
New York yesterday. &#8220;Moving freight by train rather than road
is highly advantageous.&#8221; 
Purchasing stakes in the U.S. rail companies has helped the
fund gain 11 percent in value since its January start and beat
the advances in Japan&#8217;s Topix Index and the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average. The fund, which has 19.8 percent of its holdings in the
U.S., was started Jan. 26 and is sold only in Japan. 
U.S. rail&#8217;s prospects spurred Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. last year to agree to spend $27 billion to buy 77.4 percent
of Burlington Northern it didn&#8217;t own. 
President Barack Obama earlier this year granted $8 billion
for 13 high-speed train corridors across the U.S., including a
portion to improve existing rail lines. 
Economic Rebound 
Union Pacific, the U.S. railroad with the biggest
locomotive fleet, is predicting growth in freight this year amid
more demand for transporting commodities as the U.S. economy
returned to growth. 
North American railroad volume, considered a leading
indicator for economic conditions, has gained 1.5 percent in the
year to March 27, according to the Association of American
Railroads, rebounding from a 16.2 percent slump last year. 
&#8220;There are only four major players and so it&#8217;s a fairly
small market,&#8221; Kirkman said. &#8220;Freight transport will continue
to grow.&#8221; 
Union Pacific fell 0.2 percent to $73.64 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. It has gained 15 percent
this year. CSX has gained 8.2 percent this year while Norfolk
Southern has advanced 9.9 percent. 
The fund doesn&#8217;t have a benchmark. Its gains compare with an
8.7 percent increase in the Topix index and a 9.5 percent
advance in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s head of
environmental commodities including carbon emissions, Gerrit
Nicholas, has left the firm, according to a bank official
briefed on the decision. 
Rich Sberlati, a vice president at the New York-based
securities firm, will become head of North American
environmental commodities, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced. Goldman
Sachs spokesman Melissa Daly declined to comment. Nicholas
couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. 
Banks including Goldman Sachs, London-based Barclays Plc
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. have been monitoring negotiations on
U.S. climate-change legislation, which stalled in the Senate,
dampening prospects for a &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; market for carbon-
dioxide emissions. The firms are seeking to play a key role in
any new nationwide system. 
Carbon allowances in a smaller trading program running in
10 Northeastern states fell 41 percent in 2009 and 7.4 percent
this year. The decline reflects, in part, uncertainty about the
outcome of climate-change talks, said Kedin Kilgore, named in
January to head Barclays Capital&#8217;s carbon-trading business. 
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough guidance out of D.C. to know if we
will have a confirmed trading program this year and whether a
federal program will fully supersede any regional program,&#8221;
Kilgore, head of U.S. emissions trading at Barclays unit, said
in an interview. 
The U.S. carbon market has the potential to surge to more
than $300 billion by 2020, according to Point Carbon, an Oslo-
based firm that analyzes environmental markets.

Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the
lender to the owners of Florida&#8217;s Sawgrass Marriott Resort,
asked a bankruptcy court for permission to take over and sell
the company&#8217;s assets. 
Goldman yesterday asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn
in Jacksonville, Florida, to lift the automatic stay, a part of
the bankruptcy code that shields a company from creditors&#8217;
efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs Mortgage is a
division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Goldman, owed about $193 million, claims the company no
longer has a stake in the property and can&#8217;t restructure its
debts. 
&#8220;The resort property that is the subject of this
bankruptcy is worth less than the amount of the debt, and there
is clearly no equity in the property,&#8221; lawyers for the lender
said in court papers. 
RQB Resort LP, which filed bankruptcy March 1 to stop a
prior foreclosure action by Goldman, owns the 65-acre resort in
Ponte Vedra Beach that is home to the TPC Sawgrass golf club
where the U.S. PGA Tour&#8217;s Players Championship is held, court
papers show. Affiliate RQB Development also sought protection. 
In July 2006, Goldman helped finance RQB Resort and RQB
Development&#8217;s $220.5 million purchase of the property, court
papers show. RQB representatives met Goldman in March 2009 and
said that they might have &#8220;liquidity issues&#8221; by August. 
Negotiation Effort 
In June, the owners hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP to
broker a solution with Goldman. After almost three months of
negotiating, the owners believed that Perella had fashioned an
agreement on a restructuring except for one issue, according to
court documents. In October, Goldman told the owners it intended
to foreclose, the resort owner said. 
&#8220;When asked in early November why the restructuring was no
longer an alternative, Goldman Sachs stated that its management
had changed its mind and preferred to own the resort,&#8221; RQB said
in court papers. 
RQB Resort is the exclusive partner to the PGA Tour&#8217;s
Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, known as TPC Sawgrass,
court papers show. The 508-room hotel resort has rights to
85 percent of the starting times each day to the Players Stadium
Course through 2089. 
Tiger Woods made his Feb. 19 apology for his marital
infidelity at the TPC Sawgrass golf club. 
The course was ranked ninth on Golf Digest&#8217;s list of
America&#8217;s 100 Greatest Public Courses for 2009-2010. The TPC
Sawgrass is known for its 17th hole, where World Golf Hall of
Fame architect Peter Dye placed the green on an island in a
small lake. 
The Masters Tournament started today, with Phil Mickelson,
Lee Westwood, Yong-Eun Yang, and 60-year-old Tom Watson tied for
the early lead at 5-under par. Woods, the No. 1 golfer in the
Official World Ranking, is 1-under par through the first 6
holes. 
The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville).

GSW Immobilien AG, a German property
company owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Cerberus Capital
Management LP, aims to raise about 140 million euros ($187
million) in an initial public offering. 
The Berlin-based joint venture will offer as much as 15
percent on top of the base amount, according to terms of the
deal obtained by Bloomberg News. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank
AG are managing the sale, which is scheduled for the second
quarter, as joint global coordinators. 
The company aims for a free float of at least 49.9 percent
of the stock after the IPO in a primary and secondary share
sale. The amount to be raised from the secondary offering has
yet to be confirmed, according to the term sheet. 
The offering comes after German companies raised 1.7
billion euros from IPOs in March, the biggest amount since July
2007, Bloomberg data show. Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, the
country&#8217;s largest cable company, sold 759 million euros of stock
and chemicals distributor Brenntag AG raised 748 million euros. 
GSW was sold by the city of Berlin to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Whitehall Funds unit and Cerberus, the U.S. investment fund, for
almost 2 billion euros in 2004. 
The company&#8217;s 49,700 properties have space of about 3.1
million square meters (33.4 million square feet) and were valued
at about 2.6 billion euros at the end of last year, according to
a statement today. GSW also manages another 17,000 homes.

Coca-Cola Co. has started testing a
reduced-sugar soft drink in Germany, preparing a second attack
on Bionade GmbH, the organic drinks maker that has rejected
takeover bids from the world&#8217;s largest beverage producer. 
Coca-Cola has been testing consumer reaction to a naturally
fruit-flavored soft drink called Tumult since February in about
40 Alex bar-restaurants owned by British pub operator Mitchells
 Butlers Plc. A 0.33-liter bottle of Tumult costs 2.80 euros
($3.72), 20 cents more than a bottle of Fanta or Coke. 
Tumult is Coca-Cola&#8217;s second swipe at Bionade, which with a
6 percent market share is Germany&#8217;s third-largest non-cola soft
drink brand behind Coke&#8217;s Fanta and Sprite. Coca-Cola in 2008
introduced Spirit of Georgia, with &#8220;less sugar and carbonic
acid&#8221; than rival sodas, according to its Web site. 
&#8220;Tumult is addressing adult consumers, and we will examine
the drink&#8217;s acceptance in the coming months,&#8221; said Kristina
Brehm, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in Germany. The drink hasn&#8217;t
been officially announced, she said. 
Coca-Cola has made approaches to buy Bionade, according to
the company&#8217;s co-owner and Chief Executive Officer Peter
Kowalsky. The Atlanta-based beverage producer made an offer
worth &#8220;hundreds of millions,&#8221; he said in an interview in 2007.
Dr. August Oetker KG, the family company that owns Germany&#8217;s
largest brewery, bought a majority stake in Bionade last year. 
Brehm declined to comment about offers for Bionade. 
Spirit of Georgia 
Spirit of Georgia had less than 1 percent market share last
year in the German non-cola soft drinks market, which is worth
about 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion), according to data
provided by the country&#8217;s industry group for non-alcoholic
beverages. 
&#8220;Organic soft drinks have shown an above-average growth
pace in the past and I expect the segment to continue growing in
the future,&#8221; Detlef Gross, head of the industry group, said. 
Bionade&#8217;s drinks are made through a fermentation process
that generates gluconic acid, which is found naturally in honey
and fruit, rather than alcohol, according to the company&#8217;s Web
site. Bionade says it uses only natural ingredients, and its
drinks carry the seal of the European Union&#8217;s organic food
control board. 
Bionade is being offered in five different flavors while
Spirit of Georgia is available in three. Tumult, which uses some
fermented ingredients, is currently being sold in a &#8220;fruity&#8221;
and a &#8220;bittersweet&#8221; variety. 
Ostheim, Germany-based Bionade, which was founded in 1985
and had forecast turnover of as many as 230 million bottles in
2009, isn&#8217;t concerned about the potential new competitor,
Kowalsky said. None of the more than 30 rival products on the
German market has lowered its own market share, he added. 
Bionade, which generates the major part of revenue in its
domestic market, aims to accelerate international expansion, the
executive said. In neighboring Austria, the beverage is being
served in bars and restaurants and is sold in organic grocery
stores. The company is currently hiring vendors in what Kowalsky
calls &#8220;trendsetter cities&#8221; including Barcelona and San
Francisco, where Bionade is available in more than 100 bars.

&#8220;isn&#8217;t an insurer,&#8221; Bernheim was also cited as saying.
Bernheim hasn&#8217;t decided whether to accept an offer to become
honorary chairman because it doesn&#8217;t involve having a seat on
the board, according to the report. 
The new board will be voted in at the insurer&#8217;s annual

Generali, Italy&#8217;s largest insurer.

China&#8217;s March trade deficit is
temporary and the pressure for the yuan to gain remains intact,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
&#8220;The weak exports in March were likely due to the Lunar
New Year effects as exporters suspend production for an extended
period after the holiday,&#8221; wrote Hong Kong-based analysts Song
Yu and Helen Qiao in a report on April 10. &#8220;Given the strong
underlying exports growth and rising overheating pressures, we
believe a modest yuan revaluation is still on the agenda.&#8221; 
China posted its first trade deficit in six years in March,
even as the yuan remained pegged to the dollar. Exports gained
24 percent from a year earlier, after climbing 46 percent in
February. Imports jumped 66 percent last month from the same
period last year, compared to a 45 percent increase in February.
This resulted in $7.24 billion shortfall, versus the median
forecast for a $390 million deficit in a Bloomberg News survey. 
China&#8217;s yuan traded at 6.8248 per dollar as of 9:33 a.m. in
Shanghai versus 6.8239 on April 9, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System. The central bank has kept the
currency around 6.83 since July 2008. 
Goldman on April 1 raised its three- and six-month
projections for the yuan to reflect expectations the currency
will be allowed to strengthen this quarter. It predicted the
yuan will appreciate to 6.74 per dollar by the end of June and
6.66 by the end of September. 
Policy makers will probably allow appreciation to resume by
widening the currency&#8217;s trading band versus the dollar to 1
percent, from 0.5 percent, and commencing a &#8220;downward crawl&#8221;
of the central bank&#8217;s reference rate, Goldman said on April 1.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, fell the most in three weeks in
New York trading after a newsletter report that Simon Property
Group Inc. may abandon a takeover bid for its smaller rival. 
Simon, based in Indianapolis, is unlikely to move ahead
with its buyout offer because of antitrust concerns, the REIT
Newshound reported last night, citing sources it didn&#8217;t
identify. Simon has concluded that an attorney for Chicago-based
General Growth who deals with antitrust issues wasn&#8217;t dealing in
&#8220;good faith,&#8221; the newsletter said, citing one of the sources. 
Les Morris, a spokesman for Simon Property, declined to
comment. David Keating, a General Growth spokesman, didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. 
General Growth fell 3.6 percent to $16.13 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the biggest drop since March 23. The
shares have jumped 72 percent since Feb. 15, the day before
Simon made public a $10 billion offer to buy the company out of
bankruptcy. General Growth dismissed the bid as too low and
instead plans to exit bankruptcy with financing from a group led
by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. 
&#8220;GGP shares were priced based on some sort of topping from
Simon,&#8221; said Benjamin Yang, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette 
Woods in San Francisco. &#8220;Based on this news, it seems less
likely that Simon will come back with an offer higher than the
$15-a-share proposal from Brookfield.&#8221; 
General Growth filed the biggest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history almost a year ago after amassing $27 billion in
debt making acquisitions. Simon&#8217;s bid would have given equity
investors about $9 a share and paid unsecured creditors in full. 
Simon has been preparing a new offer for General Growth, a
person with knowledge of the plan told Bloomberg News last
month.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, is courting
endowment heads to join its asset-management group, according to
three people with knowledge of the search. 
The company started approaching chief investment officers
at endowments, as well as money managers that oversee such
assets, late last year, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the search isn&#8217;t public. The bank is looking
to expand its portfolio-solutions team of 50 employees, which
invests on behalf of clients and works on asset allocation,
portfolio construction and manager selection, said Andrea
Raphael, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company. 
&#8220;When they hire a CIO, not only can they then sell their
product better, but that gives them internal knowledge,&#8221;
Charles Skorina, whose headhunting firm Charles A. Skorina  Co.
in San Francisco advises endowments, said in an interview last
week. &#8220;This guy comes into Goldman and the Goldman guys say,
&#8216;OK, what kind of products does an endowment need and how should
we structure our products so we can go and sell a complete
set?&#8217;&#8221; 
Pacific Investment Management Co. and Perella Weinberg
Partners have added or expanded asset-management services for
endowments as they recover from record losses during the
financial crisis. U.S. institutions will outsource more than
half a trillion dollars in investments by the end of 2012,
according to estimates by consultant Casey Quirk  Associates
LLC. 
Candidate Search 
The portfolio-solutions group is part of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, catering to endowments, foundations, public
and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, family
offices and insurance firms, Raphael said. Chris Kojima and
Charles Baillie, partners at the firm, run the group. The asset-
management unit also serves those clients through its fund-of-
funds group, which invests about $80 billion in outside firms. 
The firm approached candidates through headhunter Charles
Sterling Group LLC in Boston, said two of the people, who had
been contacted and turned down the job. The bank has talked with
candidates from pension funds, endowments and other asset
managers, according to another person familiar with the search.
Raphael declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s recruiting efforts. 
U.S. institutions will probably outsource $510 billion in
investments by the end of 2012, more than double the $195
billion as of the most recent data at the end of 2008, according
to Casey Quirk of Darien, Connecticut. Investors most likely to
use outsourcing services are those with $250 million to $750
million in assets, which struggle to find talent and can&#8217;t
access the best investment strategies, the company said. 
Yale&#8217;s Swensen 
It costs about $2 million to $3 million a year to maintain
an investment office with five employees, compared with a fee of
50 basis points on assets under management in a typical
outsourced agreement, Skorina said. 
Endowments outperformed market indexes for years by
following a style pioneered by David Swensen, Yale University&#8217;s
investment chief. The strategy relies on so-called alternative
assets including commodities, real estate and private equity to
outperform market indexes. Some of those hard-to-sell holdings
fell more than public stocks and bonds in the year ending June
2009, leaving endowments with losses. 
&#8220;Investing in alternatives and alternatives being a much
bigger allocation of portfolios has been a big driver in the
interest in outsourcing,&#8221; said Kevin Quirk, a partner at Casey
Quirk. Losses from some alternative investments &#8220;brought into
question whether or not these things are sustainable for the
long term,&#8221; he said. 
Rate Swaps 
Top endowments used outsourcing firms in the 1960s and
1970s, which were &#8220;generally disasters,&#8221; said Josh Lerner, a
Harvard Business School professor who wrote a case study on
Yale&#8217;s endowment. The New Haven, Connecticut school, which
helped to found Endowment Management and Research Corp. in
Boston, fired the manager in 1979 after the institution&#8217;s fund
had dropped 46 percent since 1969 on an inflation-adjusted
basis, according to Lerner&#8217;s research. 
&#8220;The intermediaries tended to take a very short-run view
or else engaged in activities that were beneficial for their own
account trading or client development but were detrimental to
the long-run returns of their university clients,&#8221; Lerner said
in an e-mail. 
Forst 
For more than 20 years, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Citigroup Inc. sold swaps as a way for schools, towns and
nonprofit organizations to reduce interest costs and protect
against rising payments on variable-rate debt. In 2008, the
value of Harvard&#8217;s interest-rate swaps tumbled and its endowment
plunged, forcing the school to raise $2.5 billion in bonds that
December as it was squeezed for collateral. 
Edward Forst, who rejoined Goldman Sachs in September after
11 months helping to oversee finances at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, became co-head of the firm&#8217;s
investment-management division at the end of February with Tim
O&#8217;Neill. Before he left for Harvard, Forst had spent less than a
year helping to run Goldman&#8217;s investment-management unit. 
Asset management, which oversees funds for institutions and
wealthy individuals, is a smaller department at Goldman Sachs
than investment banking and trading. The division&#8217;s 2009 revenue
of $3.97 billion accounted for 8.8 percent of the firm&#8217;s sales.
Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from 2008 as incentive and
management fees declined. Assets under management climbed 12
percent from a year earlier to $871 billion as rising markets
more than offset fund withdrawals. 
Pimco Additions 
The division doubled its third-party distribution sales
force last year and &#8220;significantly&#8221; increased its coverage of
institutional and private wealth accounts, according to the
firm&#8217;s annual letter to shareholders April 7. The unit serves
2,000 institutional clients and more than 25,000 private wealth
accounts. 
Pimco, led by Mohamed El-Erian, the former Harvard fund
chief, last month hired Gregory Hazlett as head of equity
strategies and Andrew Hoffmann to oversee real-asset
investments. They report to Mark Taborsky, an executive vice
president at the firm and former Harvard endowment manager.
Taborsky leads a fund-of-funds unit, based on the alternative-
investing model of endowments, targeting school funds and other
clients. 
Campus Recruits 
Other asset managers have recruited chief investment
officers from schools. Perella Weinberg in New York hired
Christopher Bittman, former CIO of the University of Colorado
Foundation, in July to lead a unit that manages money for
endowments. David Russ, a former manager of Dartmouth College&#8217;s
fund, was hired in June at Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG
as a chief investment strategist in asset management. 
A number of higher-education money managers have left
academia to start their own firms. They include Jack Meyer, who
stepped down from his Harvard Management Co. chief executive
officer post in 2005 to form Convexity Capital Management LP in
Boston with $6.3 billion from clients, and ex-Stanford
Management Co. head Michael McCaffery, who raised $7 billion
from investors including Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen
to start Makena Capital Management LLC in 2006. 
University funds lost an average of 19 percent in the year
ending June 2009, according to the National Association of
College and University Business Officers, based in Washington,
and Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut. It was the biggest annual
loss in the 35 years for which records have been kept. 
Endowment Turnover 
With tumbling endowments has come turnover in the ranks of
managers who oversee the funds. Dartmouth College in Hanover,
New Hampshire, Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts,
and New York University in Manhattan didn&#8217;t immediately fill CIO
positions as they reviewed spending. Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Connecticut, fired CIO Thomas Kannam in October. 
James Walsh of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York,
announced plans in February to step down at the end of the
academic year. Christopher Brightman resigned last month from
the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Stanford
University&#8217;s endowment, the third-richest among U.S. colleges,
is searching for a chief investment officer after leaving the
post vacant for more than two years.

Microsoft Corp. introduced a line
of mobile phones today that are focused on social-networking
features to win over teens and young adults who have flocked to
devices from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. 
Called Kin One and Kin Two, the phones will be made by
Sharp Corp. and sold in the U.S. by Verizon Wireless starting in
May, Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft President Robbie
Bach, who oversees the mobile-phone unit, demonstrated the
phones today at an event in San Francisco. 
The phones represent a new strategy for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, which previously had only developed
software for phone manufacturers, rather than getting deeply
into hardware design itself. The move echoes Google&#8217;s decision
to sell the Nexus One handset in addition to offering phone
makers its Android operating system. 
&#8220;We said, &#8216;Look, there&#8217;s a segment here that we can really
go after deeply,&#8221; Bach said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;And once you decide to go deep, you
can&#8217;t go part way and say we&#8217;ll do the software and then we&#8217;ll
hand it off to somebody else. You have to really be involved in
the whole process.&#8221; 
The Kin phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain
and the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. 
Microsoft may develop phone hardware for other segments of
the market in the future, said Todd Peters, vice president in
the company&#8217;s mobile communications marketing group. 
Partners or Competitors 
The risk in the strategy is that phone makers who view
Microsoft and Google as partners see these moves as competition,
making them less likely to want to use Microsoft&#8217;s or Google&#8217;s
operating systems, ABI Research analyst Kevin Burden said. Bach
said in January that it would be &#8220;very, very difficult&#8221; for
Google to sell its own phone while keeping manufacturers and
carriers for other Android handsets happy. 
Bach said Microsoft&#8217;s approach is different than Google&#8217;s,
because Google sells the Nexus One itself, while Microsoft is
relying on Verizon and Vodafone. 
&#8220;They can get away with it because they&#8217;re not selling it
themselves,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s Burden said of Microsoft. &#8220;It looks really
different because they didn&#8217;t set up their own Web site store
for it like Google.&#8221; 
Microsoft fell 2 cents to $30.32 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares are little changed this year. 
Social-Networking Sites 
The Kin phones include cameras, touch screens and slide-out
keyboards for text messaging. The phone takes updates from
social-networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace
and displays them in one place on the phone&#8217;s main screen,
called the Kin Loop. Users can drag videos, photos, status
updates, text messages and Web sites to one spot on the phone
and then share the whole package of content with friends. 
Microsoft spokeswoman Melissa Havel declined to disclose
pricing for the phones. 
Facing market share declines, Microsoft also is releasing a
new version of its phone operating system for handset
manufacturers to use later this year. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows dropped to a 7.9 percent share of the
worldwide smartphone-software market in the fourth quarter from
12.5 percent a year earlier, while the iPhone and Android posted
gains, according to ABI Research. 
The iPhone took 16.6 percent of the market in the fourth
quarter, up from 10.8 percent the previous year, Oyster Bay, New
York-based ABI said. Android climbed to 8.5 percent from 1.7
percent. 
Targeting Young Consumers 
Verizon Wireless, based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and
U.K.-based Vodafone are targeting young people who will buy
plans for texting and Web access, seeking to expand their
fastest-growing revenue stream. Sales of data plans at Verizon
Wireless rose 46 percent in the fourth quarter, contributing
almost a third of the company&#8217;s wireless-service revenue. 
Microsoft and Verizon Wireless kept the Kin&#8217;s target
demographic group in mind at today&#8217;s event, held at a San
Francisco club called Mighty. A rusty truck stood outside
selling sugar waffles. Inside, baristas hired from a local cafe
served up Ethiopian and Brazilian coffee while photos of denim-
and flannel-clad young people flashed on screens around the
room. 
&#8220;This is an age group Microsoft has to court,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s
Burden said. &#8220;They&#8217;re kind of losing this group to Apple and
Google, and what they don&#8217;t want is to have all these late teens
and early 20-somethings not growing up Microsoft.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, who took over from John Mack in January,
said he&#8217;s not content with results for last year, when the
company reported its first per-share annual loss. 
&#8220;We are not satisfied with our performance,&#8221; Gorman said
today in a letter to shareholders. &#8220;Our goal, as we move
forward, is to rank in the top three in the key businesses in
which we operate.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
trailed rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in trading
revenue last year. Gorman&#8217;s New York-based firm has hired more
than 350 employees as part of a &#8220;revitalization&#8221; of its sales
and trading business, he said in the letter. 
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the firm to post
adjusted earnings of $2.85 a share in 2010, according to the
average of 27 estimates. That would be the largest profit since
2006. 
Gorman, 51, said &#8220;headwinds&#8221; related to the firm&#8217;s
tightening debt spreads are &#8220;largely behind us.&#8221; Those charges
reduced the firm&#8217;s revenue last year by $5.5 billion and lowered
earnings per share by $2.84, according to the letter. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s joint venture with Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith
Barney wealth-management unit &#8220;is going to play an increasingly
important role in our growth and profitability,&#8221; Gorman said.
Morgan Stanley purchased a controlling stake in the venture last
year, giving it about 18,000 financial advisers and $1.56
trillion in client assets as of Dec. 31. 
TARP Program 
There is &#8220;no question&#8221; that Morgan Stanley and the
financial industry benefited from the Treasury Department&#8217;s
Troubled Asset Relief Program and other government efforts to
stabilize markets, Gorman said. 
He also called on the industry to &#8220;work as partners with
regulators and legislators&#8221; in shaping regulatory reform, and
declared his support for a systemic-risk regulator with the
ability to prevent &#8220;excessive&#8221; risk taking. 
&#8220;In the wake of the financial crisis, we believe that
fundamental regulatory reform is critical for our industry--and
the global capital markets,&#8221; Gorman wrote. &#8220;We are committed
to working cooperatively with policy makers and to playing a
constructive role in building a new regulatory framework.&#8221;

The German auction for mobile-
phone frequencies, which started today, is the largest in a
slew of such sales in Europe and may determine how much
operators are willing to pay for new spectrum. 
The new frequencies will alleviate pressure on networks as
companies including Apple Inc. unveil data-hungry devices such
as the iPad tablet computer and users increasingly download
videos and music on mobile phones. Deutsche Telekom AG,
Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and Royal KPN NV are
participating in the auction. 
The phone companies will spend as much as 6 billion euros
($8.1 billion) combined, Moody&#8217;s Investors Service estimates,
while Commerzbank AG predicts a total investment of 7.5 billion
euros. At the last German auction in 2000, the sale of third-
generation licenses fetched 99.4 billion deutsche marks, or
about 50 billion euros. 
&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to be anywhere near
those crazy amounts that we saw in 2000,&#8221; CreditSights analyst
Mark Chapman said in a phone interview today. &#8220;With 10 more
years of maturity, the industry is much more realistic.&#8221; 
In the first round, the four companies&#8217; highest bids
totaled 94.5 million euros, with Telefonica&#8217;s O2 emerging as
the highest bidder, exceeding minimum bids allowed by three
times in two instances, and by 80 percent in six instances. 
Where Deutsche Telekom was the highest bidder it exceeded
the minimum bid allowed by 0.8 percent or by nothing, Vodafone
exceeded minimum allowed bids by 0.4 percent or by nothing, and
KPN&#8217;s E-Plus submitted bids that were at most 0.8 percent
higher than the minimum. In the second round, the highest bids
totaled 114.9 million euros. 
Auction Schedules 
The Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Sweden and France are
expected to hold auctions this year, according to Chapman. The
U.K. is expected to auction frequencies next year, while Spain,
Italy and Portugal have yet to say when their auctions will
take place. 
Deutsche Telekom, Europe&#8217;s largest telephone company,
Vodafone, Telefonica&#8217;s O2 and KPN&#8217;s E-Plus are the four network
operators in Germany. They have a combined 108.5 million
subscribers as some of the 82 million people living in the
country have more than one mobile-phone subscription. 
Pressure on Networks 
&#8220;There&#8217;s already a situation in the U.S. where it&#8217;s
getting more difficult for smartphones to access the Internet,
especially in San Francisco and Manhattan,&#8221; said Matthias
Kurth, president of the German federal network agency, in
Mainz, Germany, at an April 8 briefing on the auction. &#8220;We
want to avert such a development here.&#8221; 
In December, the wireless division of ATT Inc., the
biggest U.S. phone company, said 1 percent of smartphone
customers accounted for 20 percent of the data drain on its
network, while its top 3 percent were using 40 percent. 
In the U.S., Federal Communications Chairman Julius
Genachowski said in February that the country faces a &#8220;looming
spectrum crunch&#8221; and said he wants to auction airwaves held by
television stations to make room for more mobile Internet use. 
The most coveted frequencies in Germany are in the 800
megahertz band, previously used to broadcast TV and dubbed the
&#8220;digital dividend.&#8221; These have better indoor coverage and
geographical reach than higher frequencies, making it cheaper
to build networks that facilitate broadband coverage in rural
areas. 
Partnership Possibilities 
Under the auction terms, only three of the four German
operators will be able to secure enough spectrum in the 800 MHz
band. Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone, which have a combined
market share of 70 percent, may gain the biggest slice of the
frequency. 
In the first round of bids, O2 submitted two bids of 7.5
million euros for two of the paired frequencies in the 800 MHz
band, or three times the minimum 2.5 million euros allowed. In
the second round, E-Plus overtook Telefonica as the highest
bidder for the two pairs of frequencies, at 8.6 million euros. 
Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s highest bid for another two 800 MHz
frequency pairs was 2.52 million euros each, or 20,000 euros
above the minimum allowed, and Vodafone bid 2.51 million euros
for the last pair. Both companies&#8217; bids remained unchallenged
in the second round. 
Following the auction, Telefonica&#8217;s O2 and KPN&#8217;s E-Plus
may seek a partnership either with each other, or O2 with
Vodafone, if they don&#8217;t get the spectrum they need on their
own, analysts have said. 
Bernstein Research analyst Robin Bienenstock said in a
note on March 17 that E-Plus may need to strike a network-
sharing deal in Germany after the auction to limit operating
expenses. 
Network Terms 
KPN Chief Executive Officer Ad Scheepbouwer has said he
remains open to any form of partnership. Auction rules prohibit
cooperation during the auction, meaning all bidders are on
their own until the bidding is over. 
The 800 MHz frequencies come with specific terms attached.
The winners commit to building a network to cover at least 90
percent of the population in rural towns and districts,
starting with areas with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, before
they can use these frequencies in more densely populated areas. 
The costs associated with these terms may prompt companies
to spend on other frequencies, Kurth said. In total, 41
frequency blocks are for sale. 
The operators are free to choose which technology they
wish to employ. Last time around, frequencies were allocated to
GSM or UMTS technologies. 
&#8216;Game of Chicken&#8217; 
All the operators in Germany have had to name which
frequencies they intend to bid on, and, according to Kurth, the
demand is for &#8220;significantly more&#8221; than is available. 
The auction started today at 1 pm. From tomorrow, it will
take place from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day, with a minimum of
four rounds of bidding per day at 90 minutes per round. The
result of each round, with the name of the highest bidder for
each frequency block, will be published on the network agency&#8217;s
Web site. The auction ends when no higher bids are submitted
for any of the frequencies. 
&#8220;The companies have many rounds to go through, they don&#8217;t
really need to decide right now,&#8221; CreditSights&#8217; Chapman said.
&#8220;They will probably see how the bids unfold. It&#8217;s definitely a
game of chicken.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Japan
Chairman Akio Asuke, a former veteran banker at Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., will step down on June 30. 
Asuke, 67, will become an adviser starting July 1, the U.S.
bank said in a statement distributed at the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today. He joined Goldman Sachs after resigning as deputy
president at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in June 2002, it said. 
Asuke&#8217;s departure comes three months after Sumitomo Mitsui
asked Goldman Sachs to convert its preferred shares to an equity
stake. The New York-based firm in 2003 bought 150.3 billion yen
($1.6 billion) of the Sumitomo Mitsui securities to help bolster
capital eroded by losses on holdings and bad loans. 
Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t decided who will succeed Asuke or if
the bank will retain the position, said Hiroko Matsumoto, a
Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Goldman Sachs.

Nashville, home of country-music
stars such as Taylor Swift and the Grand Ole Opry, will boost
city-backed debt by almost 40 percent to borrow $633 million for
a new convention center three times the size of the Tennessee
municipality&#8217;s current one. 
Bonds to be sold tomorrow by Nashville and Davidson
County&#8217;s Convention Center Authority through investment banks
led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pledge general-fund revenue if
hotel, airport and rental-car taxes and use of the Music City
Center aren&#8217;t enough to repay investors. The tourism revenue
won&#8217;t be adequate, said Councilwoman Emily Evans, a former
municipal bond underwriter. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a riverboat gamble with very little upside,&#8221; said
Evans, who worked for 15 years at J.C. Bradford  Co., the
Nashville firm acquired by Paine Webber in 2000. &#8220;It just
doesn&#8217;t seem like a good bet to me.&#8221; 
Nashville, the home of the Country Music Hall of Fame,
hopes to enhance tourism by creating retail and parking areas,
tripling exhibit space to 350,000 square feet and adding 64,000
square feet of ballrooms, according to the preliminary official
statement. 
The $415 million Music City Center will enable the city to
compete for larger meetings, add 1,524 jobs and generate almost
$135 million of new annual spending by 2017, according to a
study by HVS Convention, Sports  Entertainment in Chicago on
Jan. 6. The facility is forecast to yield almost $12 million in
new tax revenue beyond tourism levies dedicated to the $40
million-a-year of debt service, said consulting firm HVS. 
Attendance Down 
With convention center attendance down nationwide -- a 30
percent decline in Las Vegas and 28 percent in Orlando, Florida,
two of the largest convention markets in the U.S. -- Nashville&#8217;s
taxpayers may wind up paying part of the cost if use of the new
center falls short, said Heywood Sanders, professor of public
administration at the University of Texas in San Antonio, who
has studied convention centers. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a leap of faith,&#8221; said Sanders, who&#8217;s writing
a book on convention center financing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty large
chunk of debt.&#8221; 
The city is selling in four parts, with about $605 million
as taxable Build America Bonds, which come with a 35 percent
subsidy from the U.S. government under economic stimulus
legislation passed last year by Congress. 
The average yield on Build America securities fell 6 basis
points to a three-week low of 6.17 percent yesterday, according
to the Wells Fargo Build America Bond Index. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. 
Tourism Boost 
A larger convention center is forecast to increase hotel
room-tax receipts for the city to $30.5 million in 2014 from
just over $28 million in 2009, according to a feasibility study
released by HVS on March 26. By 2019, it&#8217;s estimated to exceed
$40 million a year. At the same time the new borrowings will
increase debt backed by the city&#8217;s general fund by 39.6 percent
to $2.23 billion. 
&#8220;We have an opportunity to take visitor taxes and fees,
and invest them in a way that creates jobs and grows our local
economy,&#8221; Mayor Karl Dean said in a Jan. 6 statement. 
A new facility was needed to attract conventions, said
Marty Dickens, chairman of the convention center authority, in a
phone interview. The city is using the same financial model it
employed for the existing site in 1987, which is now too small
to compete in luring events, he said. 
&#8216;Untested&#8217; Projections 
Fitch Ratings, which ranks the bonds being sold at A+, in
evaluating the convention center debt, lowered the city&#8217;s
general obligation grade by one rung on April 6 to AA-, its
fourth-highest level, citing the &#8220;potential additional fiscal
strains of the debt-financed convention center upon an already
pressured general fund,&#8221; the company said. Projections on two
tourism taxes &#8220;are untested&#8221; and &#8220;heavily dependent upon
increased tourism&#8221; at the convention center, Fitch said. 
&#8220;We realized the city feels it will be vital to increasing
the desirability of downtown,&#8221; said Amy Laskey, an analyst at
Fitch, in a phone interview. &#8220;The city already operated on a
thinly balanced budget, so the debt does increase the risk for
the general fund.&#8221; 
The new bond issue is structured with reserves and revenue
projections that exceed what is needed to cover payments to
investors to protect the city&#8217;s general fund, said Dickens. 
&#8220;The convention market would have to seriously go to
pieces before we would need general fund dollars,&#8221; Dickens
said. &#8220;A lot of conventions like to come here because of our
reputation as a music city.&#8221; 
Moody&#8217;s Rating 
The biggest portion of the obligations is rated Aa3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the
fourth- and sixth-highest rankings, respectively. Ten-year, AAA
rated municipal bonds traded at yields of 3.28 percent, down 2
basis points from a nine-month high today. 
Richard Riebeling, the city&#8217;s director of finance, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. Wayne Placide, the city&#8217;s
financial adviser with First Southwest Co. in Dallas, referred a
request for comment to Jeff Scruggs, a managing director with
Goldman Sachs. The firm&#8217;s spokesman, Michael DuVally, said
Scruggs couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show further losses in its
prime and subprime mortgage portfolios when it reports first-
quarter earnings, according to analyst Dick Bove. 
&#8220;Losses have not been curtailed,&#8221; Bove, vice president of
Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida, said in a Bloomberg
Radio interview today with Tom Keene. &#8220;In the commercial
industrial loan portfolio and in the consumer portfolio, we
should start to see some improvement.&#8221; 
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon faces
challenges with low money-lending rates and increasing
regulation, said Bove, who has &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-
based bank. 
&#8220;His margins are going to be stressed because he needs
higher interest rates,&#8221; Bove said. &#8220;His loan volume is likely
to be lower, and they&#8217;re going to be issues with his noninterest
income because of this new Regulation E and the credit-card bill
-- both of which control what he can charge for different
products that he signs.&#8221; 
Analysts expect JPMorgan&#8217;s net income declined from the end
of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending, with
mortgage writedowns as high as $2.5 billion per quarter during
2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009, according to
company data. Bove forecast earnings of 62 cents a share,
compared with the 64-cent average of his and 20 other analysts&#8217;
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. 
The shares of JPMorgan fell 12 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$46.02 at 3:31 p.m. in New York. 
Bove, who has been an analyst since 1965, recommended
selling Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. stock four months before
it collapsed, helping investors avoid a 65 percent plunge in the
shares before he raised them to &#8220;buy&#8221; on Aug. 21, 2008. Lehman
filed the world&#8217;s largest bankruptcy three weeks later.

General Motors Co.&#8217;s board added
Cynthia Telles, who is head of a California hospital clinic and
served with GM Chairman Ed Whitacre as a director of Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp. 
Telles, 57, is on the medical school faculty at the
University of California at Los Angeles and is director of
UCLA&#8217;s Neuropsychiatric Institute Spanish-Speaking Psychosocial
Clinic, GM said today in a statement. The addition gives the
Detroit-based automaker 13 board members. 
&#8220;She&#8217;s got a good reputation,&#8221; said Harley Shaiken, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley who
specializes in labor issues. &#8220;She does bring a diverse
perspective to the board. It appears to be a positive step.&#8221; 
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, reorganized in a
government-aided bankruptcy last year. Whitacre, 68, has led
the company&#8217;s board since GM&#8217;s July 10 exit from court
protection and took over as chief executive officer in December. 
The automaker expects to report &#8220;solid&#8221; first-quarter
operating results, Whitacre said yesterday in an e-mail to
employees. In a March 31 message to employees, he said he had
completed his overhaul of GM&#8217;s senior management. 
Telles in September joined Whitacre on the board of
Burlington Northern, the second-largest U.S. railroad by sales.
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to buy the
railroad in November and completed the purchase in February. 
Adding Telles as a director &#8220;ensures that the company will
continue to benefit from a diversity of perspectives and
experience,&#8221; GM said in its statement. She also is on the
boards of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals and
Americas United Bank, the automaker said. 
President Barack Obama appointed Telles as a member of the
Commission on Presidential Scholars last week. She was a city
commissioner in Los Angeles for 13 years. 
Telles holds a bachelor&#8217;s degree from Smith College in
Northampton, Massachusetts, and a doctorate in clinical
psychology from Boston University, GM said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
second-largest corporation, reduced Chief Executive Officer Rex
Tillerson&#8217;s compensation by 16 percent last year after the
company lost more than one-seventh of its market valuation. 
Tillerson&#8217;s compensation fell to $27.2 million in 2009 from
$32.2 million a year earlier, based on U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission rules. The information was disclosed today
by the Irving, Texas-based company in a regulatory filing. 
Tillerson, 58, was paid a salary of $2.06 million, a $2.4
million bonus and stock awards worth almost $17 million, the
filing showed. He also accrued $5.47 million from changes in the
value of his pension and deferred compensation, and $280,925 in
the form of personal security, life insurance and the use of
company-owned aircraft. 
Exxon shares fell 15 percent in 2009, the second
consecutive annual decline, as the recession squashed demand and
prices for petroleum-based fuels. Net income tumbled 57 percent
last year, the largest annual drop since Exxon Corp.&#8217;s 1999
acquisition of Mobil Corp. 
In his fifth year as CEO, Tillerson is spending almost $77
million a day to find untapped oil fields and build platforms to
exploit previous discoveries. In December, he signed a $29.2
billion deal to buy XTO Energy Inc. to capture the Fort Worth,
Texas-based company&#8217;s gas-drilling expertise and extensive North
American prospects. 
Effective Jan. 1, Tillerson&#8217;s annual salary rose 7.3
percent to $2.21 million, the filing said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, sold its 9.43 percent stake in Norwegian natural-
gas pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas Infrastructure AS. 
Exxon Mobil will retain its current capacity rights to
transport gas through the pipeline and will remain a major user
of the system, the company said in a statement on its Web site
today. Continued access to capacity is assured through the
third-party open access regime created when Gassled was
established, the company said. The sale is subject to the
approval of the Norwegian authorities. 
&#8220;This divestment will have no impact on Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
operated or partner-operated producing assets in Norway,&#8221; the
company said in the statement. Kristin Kragseth, Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
spokeswoman in Norway, declined to comment on the price the
company got for the stake. 
Gassled, a joint venture created in 2003 between oil and
gas companies operating on the Norwegian continental shelf, owns
the country&#8217;s gas transport infrastructure. Exxon was among the
partners that complained to Norway&#8217;s government in 2008 when
state-controlled Statoil ASA and Petoro AS took control of the
network, holding 32.1 percent and 38.46 percent respectively. 
The company began marketing its stake last summer, Eirik
Hauge, a spokesman for Exxon, said in August. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, Eni SpA, Dong Energy A/S
and ConocoPhillips are also stakeholders in Gassled.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show net income declined from
the end of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending
when it reports first-quarter earnings tomorrow. 
Profit was probably about $2.93 billion, or 64 cents a
share, according to the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. That compares with net income of $3.28 billion, or
74 cents, in the fourth quarter and $2.14 billion, or 40 cents,
a year earlier during the depths of the financial crisis. 
Mortgage writedowns may be as high as $2.5 billion per
quarter during 2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009,
according to company data. Analysts including Anthony Polini at
Raymond James  Associates said they will be watching to see if
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was able to reduce
provisions against future credit losses as a gauge of whether
the worst of the U.S. housing crisis is over. 
&#8220;The key factor for this quarter for banks will be to say
reserve builds are largely behind us and the outlook for lower
problem loans and loan losses have improved for the second half
of the year,&#8221; Polini said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the outlook that matters.&#8221; 
JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest competitors will probably post profits
for the quarter, according to the Bloomberg survey, even as U.S.
lenders are collapsing at the fastest pace in 17 years.
Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America Corp., may report earnings of $455 million when
it releases results on April 19, the survey shows. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America may report a profit of
$1.42 billion on April 16. 
Credit Quality 
&#8220;For the banks, the thing that matters more than anything
else is the trend in credit quality and the rate of inflow of
new problem loans. That trumps all,&#8221; said Chris Kotowski, an
equity analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t
mean that there aren&#8217;t any new problems coming in, but the rate
of inflows are diminished.&#8221; 
Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$1.77 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis and the
worst job market in 26 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The pace of losses has begun to slow in the past two
quarters and the housing market has shown signs of stabilization
even as the federal government withdraws support from financial
markets. 
Problem Loans 
Charge-offs from consumer credit-card and mortgage loans at
JPMorgan are expected to be about $8.6 billion in the first
quarter, a 10 percent increase from the previous three months,
according to Credit Suisse analysts led by Moshe Orenbuch.
&#8220;Reserving remains the largest variable to reported earnings,&#8221;
they wrote in an April 8 research note to clients. 
Dimon has succeeded in generating profit throughout the
global credit contraction, suggesting he may be able to restore
the dividend to pre-crisis levels before major competitors. 
The bank, which cut its quarterly payout to shareholders to
5 cents from 38 cents in February 2009, may boost the dividend
if the U.S. economy shows several months of improvement in the
jobless rate and there is a &#8220;significant reduction&#8221; in charge-
offs, Dimon said last month in his annual letter to
shareholders. 
The 54-year-old CEO claimed credit in the letter for
helping to stabilize markets during the crisis by purchasing
Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual as they headed toward
collapse. 
Credit Cards 
JPMorgan is offsetting declines in mortgage banking and
credit cards with trading revenue, which analysts from Credit
Suisse estimated will show an increase to $4.9 billion from $3
billion in the fourth quarter. Credit Suisse said a credit-
market recovery was fueling fixed-income results at JPMorgan. 
&#8220;The credit markets really, really did well in the first
quarter,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets
in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;It&#8217;s mainly because the Fed is
printing money and there&#8217;s a lot of money sitting on the
sidelines coming into the market right now, especially in the
fixed-income side.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said a
&#8220;broad-based&#8221; economic recovery boosted first-quarter earnings
55 percent, surprising analysts with record fixed-income trading
revenue and a better-than-expected outlook for consumer credit. 
Net income at the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets
climbed to $3.33 billion, or 74 cents a share, from $2.14
billion, or 40 cents, in the same period a year earlier and from
$3.28 billion in the fourth quarter, the New York-based company
said today in a statement. Record fixed-income trading revenue
and a reduction in provisions for credit losses helped the bank
beat the average estimate of 64 cents per share projected by 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;There is clear and broad-based improvement in the
economic factors in the United States and around the world,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, told reporters on a
conference call. 
Dimon cited signs including stabilizing U.S. home prices
that signal the economy may be poised for a &#8220;strong recovery.&#8221;
Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said delinquencies for
credit cards and mortgages in which the borrower is behind by
just one payment also improved in the first quarter, indicating
that consumers&#8217; finances are gaining strength after the worst
recession in more than 70 years. 
JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in federal aid last
year, remained profitable throughout the financial crisis,
relying on fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending
and credit cards. The bank, the No. 1 underwriter of stocks and
bonds in the U.S. last year, generated three-quarters of first-
quarter profit from its investment bank. 
Unexpected Strength 
&#8220;Nobody saw those types of numbers coming,&#8221; said Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings bode well for Bank of America Corp. and
other banks, which report earnings later this month, Miller
said. &#8220;Credit remains a wild card here, but Jamie talked very,
very positive about credit and the consumer,&#8221; he said. 
JPMorgan rose $1.86, or 4.1 percent, to $47.73 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m., the biggest
gain in six months and the highest price since Oct. 2, 2008. The
shares are up 15 percent this year. 
&#8220;China&#8217;s growing, India&#8217;s growing, Japan is growing, home
prices have stopped going down, consumer income is up, consumers
are spending, service and manufacturing indexes are up,
inventories are still low, I could go on and on,&#8221; Dimon said.
&#8220;This could be the makings of a good recovery. We don&#8217;t know
for sure, but if you look at those factors, it&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221; 
&#8216;Real Improvement&#8217; 
Cavanagh said on the call that there is &#8220;fundamental real
improvement&#8221; in consumer mortgage and credit-card
delinquencies. That didn&#8217;t translate into lower credit costs for
the quarter, though he said it &#8220;augurs well for future quarters
if those trends sustain themselves.&#8221; 
Home lending and credit-card losses continued to pull down
earnings. Retail banking lost $131 million, compared with a $399
million net loss during the fourth quarter and a $474 million
gain a year earlier. 
The company decreased provisions against future credit
losses while setting aside $2.3 billion in reserves for lawsuits
stemming from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc. Credit-card
services lost $303 million, compared with a net loss of $306
million in the prior three months and $547 million a year
earlier. 
First-quarter revenue climbed 11 percent to $27.7 billion,
beating the highest estimate among analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. Fixed-income revenue was $5.46 billion, compared with
$4.89 billion a year earlier. 
Fixed Income 
The firm said improving fixed-income markets contributed to
the revenue gains, as did a $462 million reversal of provisions
for credit costs in investment banking, which compared with $1.2
billion in expenses a year earlier. JPMorgan cited lower loan
balances, driven by repayments and loan sales. 
The bank reduced total provisions for credit losses in all
divisions to $7 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in the
previous quarter and $10 billion the year before. 
The investment bank contributed $2.47 billion of JPMorgan&#8217;s
$3.33 billion in net income, or 74 percent. That compares with
57 percent in the fourth quarter and 75 percent in the first
quarter of 2009. 
&#8220;The good news is that the revenue picture was actually
quite strong,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC, in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio.
&#8220;And in particular, within investment banking, fixed-income
trading. That had been an area of concern, so March must have
been a blockbuster month.&#8221; 
Citigroup Earnings 
JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest lender behind
JPMorgan and Bank of America, may report earnings of $340
million when it releases results on April 19, the Bloomberg
survey shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $1.1 billion on April 16. 
Dimon and Cavanagh didn&#8217;t give shareholders immediate hope
of restoring the quarterly dividend, which was cut to 5 cents
from 38 cents in February 2009. 
&#8220;We want to see continued sustained improvement in
employment, continued sustained improvement in delinquencies&#8221;
and a better understanding of new bank capital rules before the
dividend will increase, Dimon said, reiterating what he told
shareholders in his annual letter last month. 
Cavanagh said that increasing the payout to shareholders is
&#8220;going to be down the road a little more.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley, once the biggest
property investor among Wall Street banks, expects to lose $5.4
billion, or 61 percent, of its $8.8 billion global fund, said a
person familiar with the situation. 
The firm sent a fourth-quarter update to clients in recent
weeks showing the 2007 fund was likely to recover $3.4 billion
of its investments, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn&#8217;t public. A spokesman for
New York-based Morgan Stanley declined to comment. 
Morgan Stanley raised the fund, Morgan Stanley Real Estate
Fund VI International, toward the end of the property surge when
market prices were at or near the peak. At the time, it was the
largest private fund targeting high-return real estate
investments. 
&#8220;Funds of this vintage year are horribly stressed and much
of the equity they&#8217;ve invested has evaporated,&#8221; said Nori
Gerardo Lietz, head of real estate private equity at Partners
Group, who warned in July 2008 that pension funds likely would
face big writedowns on real estate in the next two years.
While the real estate losses at Morgan Stanley and other Wall
Street banks have been increasingly evident since late 2008,
&#8220;people are coming to grips with it,&#8221; said Gerardo Lietz in a
telephone interview today. 
The expected loss was reported yesterday by the Wall Street
Journal. 
Morgan Stanley invested its 2007 fund around the world,
including Asia and Europe. In the U.S., the firm defaulted last
year on a $2 billion loan to buy Crescent Real Estate Equities
Co. in 2007 and handed over 17 million square feet of office
buildings to lender Barclays Capital. Morgan Stanley agreed in
2009 to relinquish five San Francisco office buildings to its
lender, two years after buying them from Blackstone Group LP. 
Once the second-largest U.S. securities firm, Morgan
Stanley converted to a bank holding company in September 2008
and accepted $10 billion of government bailout funds to survive
the credit crisis.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said China may strengthen the yuan
by between 2 percent and 5 percent as early as next week. 
O&#8217;Neill said in an interview that trading in local
currencies among Brazil, Russia, India and China -- to be
discussed at a heads-of-state summit of so-called BRIC nations
this week in Brasilia -- won&#8217;t work because of China&#8217;s use of a
dollar peg to manage the value of the yuan. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all semantics to talk about trade in local currency
unless they do what the rest of world wants them to, which is
provide more freedom to use these currencies,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, 53,
said from London. &#8220;The consequences of Chinese policies are
increasingly seen by everyone, including the BRICs.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is building as BRIC
leaders get ready to meet this week to discuss boosting trade in
local currency and coordinating positions on reforming the
international financial system after the global credit crisis.
Chinese President Hu Jintao, who arrives in Brasilia tonight
from the U.S., told President Barack Obama yesterday that China
won&#8217;t bow to pressure after the U.S. leader urged the Asian
country to adopt a &#8220;more market-oriented exchange rate.&#8221; 
Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards rose 0.2 percent
to 6.6225 per dollar as of 12:27 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent from the spot rate of
6.8258. 
Stronger Yuan 
O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to describe the
four large, fast-growing economies, said he was pushing up his
forecast for a stronger yuan from the end of the year because it
is increasingly obvious the currency is undervalued. 
&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s exchange rate policy is &#8220;a particularly big
challenge for Brazilian&#8221; manufacturers as the country seeks to
reduce its reliance on commodity exports, O&#8217;Neill said. China
surpassed the U.S. as Brazil&#8217;s biggest trading partner last
year, as exports of iron-ore and soy rose during the global
recession while manufacturing sales to the U.S. declined. 
Still, even as the countries disagree over how to manage
their currencies, he expects no tension or public criticism of
the yuan&#8217;s peg when Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva hosts his Russian, Indian and Chinese counterparts. 
Instead, the second meeting for leaders from the four
nations will seek to find common ground about ways to reform the
International Monetary Fund, United Nations and other
international institutions. 
&#8220;Being Mr. BRIC, of course I&#8217;m flattered these guys now
meet together, but beyond all being large economies what else
can they really do collectively,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;This summit
is a very powerful symbol of how hopeless international
organizations have become.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
property funds may receive investments of as much as $100
million each from the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System
as the pension plan seeks to boost real estate holdings. 
The Tennessee system, with $29 billion in assets, is
considering putting money in the open-ended JPMorgan Strategic
Property Fund and the UBS Trumbull Property Fund, according to a
report prepared for pension board trustees. Townsend Group, the
system&#8217;s real estate consultant, recommends the funds to
clients, according to the report. 
The Tennessee retirement system plans to invest $1 billion
in real estate over the next five years. U.S. property purchases
have plunged since 2007 as values fell and financing dried up.
This year, commercial real estate sales likely will be double
the $52 billion recorded in 2009, while still below their $500
billion peak, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based research company. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still slow, but it certainly looks better than it
did six to 12 months ago,&#8221; said Robert Bach, chief economist
for Grubb  Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-based commercial
broker. &#8220;There seems to be a lot of capital out there.&#8221; 
January&#8217;s commercial real estate values in the U.S. were 40
percent below the peak in October 2007, according to the
Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index. 
Estimated Returns 
JPMorgan&#8217;s fund is estimated to return a dividend of 4.25
percent after fees and the UBS fund is expected to yield 4
percent. The gross asset value of the JPMorgan fund was $14.8
billion and the UBS fund $9.7 billion, according to the
Tennessee report. 
Kris Kagel, a spokesman for Zurich-based UBS, and Jackie
Meere of JPMorgan in New York both declined to comment. 
The State Universities Retirement System of Illinois
approved investing $100 million in the UBS fund in December,
according to meeting minutes. The UBS fund had most of its money
in office buildings, apartments and retail centers as of the end
of September, according to an annual review of UBS Realty
Investors by a staff member of the Illinois retirement system.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s head of
investment banking in India, Vedika Bhandarkar, told colleagues
she plans to quit and join Credit Suisse Group, people close to
each firm said. 
Bhandarkar, who&#8217;s been at JPMorgan in India since 1998, is
in talks with Credit Suisse about overseeing its Indian
investment banking unit, according to one of the people, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Sandeep Pangal, a managing director in JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate
finance group in Mumbai, may accompany Bhandarkar to the Swiss
bank, the people said. 
Bhandarkar and Pangal declined to comment, as did JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kavita Sonawala and Credit Suisse spokesman Adam
Harper. The two bankers have worked together for clients
including NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan&#8217;s largest mobile-phone company,
which they advised on its 2008 purchase of a $2.7 billion stake
in Tata Teleservices Ltd. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost
the vice chairman of its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last
month. She left to become country head for Bank of America Corp. 
JPMorgan, based in New York, ranks third among advisers on
mergers and acquisitions in India during the past 12 months,
based on the total dollar value of announced transactions,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
is first and Morgan Stanley second. Zurich-based Credit Suisse
ranks fourth. 
So far this year, JPMorgan is No. eight in advising on
stock sales in the country, behind Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg data
show. Credit Suisse ranks 24th. 
Credit Suisse in November said it named Rahul Chawla as
head of global markets solutions for India. In that position,
Chawla will help originate equity and debt capital markets
transactions among other things, Credit Suisse said at the time.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. claims Grupo
Televisa SA&#8217;s cable unit breached a credit agreement by
objecting to the transfer of a loan from the bank to one
controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim. 
A federal judge in New York in February halted the transfer
after Empresas Cablevision SA complained that assigning the loan
to Slim&#8217;s Banco Inbursa SA might reveal Cablevision&#8217;s
confidential information to a rival cable company owned by Slim. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is asking U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff to order Cablevision to consent to
assigning 90 percent of the $225 million loan to Banco Inbursa. 
&#8220;Cablevision&#8217;s refusal to consent to JPMorgan&#8217;s proposed
assignment to Banco Inbursa was unreasonable and therefore a
breach of the credit assignment,&#8221; JPMorgan said in its filing
yesterday. 
The Televisa unit got the loan in December of 2007 to buy
Bestel SA, which operated a fiber-optic network in Mexico.
JPMorgan originally intended to syndicate the loan but didn&#8217;t do
so in 2008 because of the deteriorating credit market, according
to the ruling. Last year, the bank started efforts to sell the
loan to Inbursa. 
Banco Inbursa is part of Grupo Financiero Inbursa SA,
controlled by Slim, as is Telefonos de Mexico SAB, or Telmex,
Mexico&#8217;s biggest land-line phone company. Telmex seeks to expand
into other telecommunications markets and is a primary
competitor of Cablevision, Rakoff said in the February ruling. 
Irreparable Harm 
Cablevision had shown it was likely to prevail on its claim
and a probability of irreparable harm, the judge said in
February. The participation agreement, under which the loan was
to be transferred, would enable Inbursa to use JPMorgan as a
vehicle for demanding Cablevision&#8217;s confidential information
&#8220;on a virtual unlimited basis,&#8221; according to Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. 
Televisa didn&#8217;t immediately comment, and a spokesman for
Slim didn&#8217;t return messages seeking comment. 
The case is Empresas Cablevision v. JPMorgan, 09-9972, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Xenon Capital Partners, an

Stan Song and Hamid Gayibov quit JPMorgan last week and may

Credit Suisse hired five fixed-income specialists last month,

Xenon said it needs more bankers to handle a &#8220;range of MA
mandates for state-owned corporates in the energy sector,&#8221;
describing Song as one of Russia&#8217;s &#8220;most reputable MA
bankers&#8221; and Gayibov as a &#8220;rainmaker&#8221; executive. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s former head of investment banking in Russia,
Natalia Tsukanova, set up Xenon last year to advise Igor Sechin,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#8217;s deputy for energy and chairman
of OAO Rosneft, the country&#8217;s largest oil company. Ex-JPMorgan
MA banker Kamil Burganov joined Xenon in February and another
colleague Anton Voronin came over in March, Burganov said. 
Twenty Hires 
Xenon is expanding as the government consolidates state
assets in industries including energy, aerospace and
shipbuilding to help reduce Russia&#8217;s dependence on oil and gas
exports, and prepares some for sale. Russia is combining six
state-owned regional airlines under OAO Aeroflot. State shipping
company Sovcomflot plans to sell shares in an initial public
offering in late 2010 or early 2011, Chief Executive Officer
Sergei Frank, a former transport minister, told reporters in
Moscow today. 
Xenon plans to hire a total of 20 staff to focus on
consolidation in the domestic energy industry and later help
state-owned companies with foreign acquisitions, Burganov said.
The company has a London office which will eventually advise
companies seeking to list on the London Stock Exchange, he said. 
As well as consulting on acquisitions, Xenon manages a $2
billion state-owned power utilities fund, Burganov said. The
fund, called Rusenergo, holds stakes in companies including OAO
Rushydro, Russia&#8217;s largest hydropower producer, and electricity
producers known as TGKs and OGKs, Burganov said. 
&#8220;The fund is focused exclusively on the power sector,&#8221;
Burganov said by phone. &#8220;But our MA advisory work for state-
owned companies will cover oil, gas, oil-services, utilities and
manufacturing sectors.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said the Chinese government may let
its currency become free floating within five years. 
&#8220;China has made noises about the renminbi being part of
the SDR from 2015,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today, referring to the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s
Special Drawing Rights. &#8220;You can&#8217;t really be part of the SDR
unless you have completely free-floating exchange rates and free
capital markets. That would imply that those who make those
noises, primarily&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China, are &#8220;pushing
for the next five years.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s current 21-month peg to
the dollar is building as Chinese President Hu Jintao this week
meets with the leaders of Brazil, Russia and India in Brasilia
to discuss boosting trade in local currency and reforming the
international financial system. President Barack Obama said this
week that the U.S. considers the yuan to be &#8220;undervalued.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s economic growth quickened to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, data released today
showed, highlighting overheating risks that may prompt the
government to scrap the peg. 
&#8220;China is increasingly the most important, not only
emerging economy, but economy, full stop, in the world,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;These first-quarter numbers take it to being the
same size as Japan. If you look at their share of world trade,
the renminbi should definitely be a wider-used currency.&#8221; 
PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan last year said the IMF&#8217;s SDRs
offer &#8220;light in the tunnel for the reform of the international
monetary system.&#8221; SDRs are a unit of account, based on a basket
of currencies, used in IMF transactions. 
The meeting this week in Brasilia is the second heads-of-
state summit of the largest emerging economies, which includes
Brazil, Russia, India and China, or so-called BRIC nations, a
term coined by O&#8217;Neill in 2001. The leaders will discuss
broadening the array of world currencies used in international
trade as the four developing nations seek to lessen their
dependence on the U.S. dollar.

China&#8217;s stock-index futures begin
trading tomorrow, giving investors a tool to hedge against
potential risks from an overheating economy and asset bubbles. 
The contracts are part of China&#8217;s push to make more
investment options available to local investors and ease market
fluctuations after the Shanghai Composite Index slumped the most
among global markets this year following an 80 percent rally in
2009. They will be based on the CSI 300 Index, tracking the 300
biggest stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses. 
&#8220;They can be used obviously for speculation but
importantly, they can also be used for hedging,&#8221; Hugh Young,
who helps oversee $232 billion of assets as head of equities at
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc in Singapore, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;Like all these instruments it depends on
how well you use them.&#8221; 
The Shanghai index has fallen 3.4 percent in 2010, making
it the worst performer in Asia, on concern the government will
tighten monetary policy to slow record lending growth and
soaring property prices. The government has twice this year
required banks to set aside a larger proportion of deposits as
reserves this year. The CSI 300 Index has fallen 4.8 percent. 
China&#8217;s economic growth accelerated to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, highlighting
overheating risks that may prompt the government to scrap the
yuan&#8217;s peg to the dollar. 
Asset Bubbles 
Last year&#8217;s rally in Chinese stocks and property prices
have prompted analysts including former Morgan Stanley economist
Andy Xie to call the nation&#8217;s asset markets a bubble that will
burst once the government curbs credit. China is &#8220;on a treadmill
to hell,&#8221; with growth driven by the &#8220;heroin of property
development,&#8221; hedge fund manager James Chanos said last week. 
&#8220;They do come with higher risks and volatility but I think
it&#8217;s the way markets develop,&#8221; Aberdeen&#8217;s Young said. 
The trading of stock-index futures on the China Financial
Futures Exchange in Shanghai follows the introduction of margin
trading and short selling on March 31. Shanghai, which has plans
to develop into an international financial center by 2020, may
start a board for listings by overseas companies later this year,
the China Daily newspaper reported today. 
The futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell the CSI
300 Index at a preset value on an agreed date. 
Investors need a minimum 500,000 yuan to open an account to
trade stock-index futures, according to rules by the securities
regulator and the China Financial Futures Exchange. 
Rising Liquidity 
They must pay cash deposits equivalent to 15 percent of the
contract value for May and June contracts and 18 percent for
contracts for September and December. The contract values are
points of the CSI 300 multiplied by 300 yuan and the minimum
contract price movement is 0.2 point, according to the futures
exchange. 
Trading will be at the &#8220;expensive side of fair value&#8221; as
volumes will be limited initially, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
in a report today. 
&#8220;Under close monitoring by authorities, we expect a
gradual increase in liquidity, but even then we do not expect a
significant direct impact on the stock market,&#8221; Christopher
Eoyang and Jason Lui, analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
report. 
Trading volumes for China&#8217;s local-currency A shares should
increase with the introduction of stock index futures, Jing
Ulrich, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s chairwoman for China equities and
commodities, said last month. 
China has the world&#8217;s third largest stock market by market
capitalization, briefly overtaking Japan in July 2009. The U.S.
is the biggest by market cap. 
U.S. Challenge 
China&#8217;s increased trading in equities from index futures
will help the nation challenge the U.S. as the world&#8217;s busiest
stock market, according to Guotai Junan Securities Co. and HSBC
Jintrust Fund Management Co. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s possible for China to surpass the U.S. in terms of
trading volumes, and index futures trading is one positive
factor that&#8217;s bolstering transactions,&#8221; Liang Jing, a Shanghai-
based analyst at Guotai, the nation&#8217;s second-largest brokerage
in terms of broking revenue, said last week. 
China currently restricts overseas investors to buying B
shares that trade in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong
dollars in Shenzen. China&#8217;s yuan-denominated A shares, are
mostly limited to local investors.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said China may strengthen the yuan
by between 2 percent and 5 percent as early as next week, even
as the cabinet signaled caution in ending crisis policies. 
O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to highlight the
growth potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said in an
interview yesterday in London he was pushing up his forecast on
the move from year-end because the currency is undervalued.
China may avoid a one-time gain that might endanger exports,
while allowing gradual appreciation by June 30 to curb inflation,
a survey of economists this week by Bloomberg News showed. 
China has pegged its currency at about 6.8 to the dollar
since July 2008, which some U.S. lawmakers say gives the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy an unfair trade advantage. The
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent to 6.62 per dollar by year-
end, according to the median estimate among the 19 economists. 
&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; 
Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards strengthened 0.1
percent to 6.6161 per dollar as of 12:40 p.m. in Hong Kong. The
contracts reflect bets the currency will appreciate 3.2 percent
from the spot rate of 6.8257. 
Accelerating Economy 
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday
that a more flexible yuan would help the world&#8217;s third-largest
economy keep inflation under control. Bernanke, responding to
questions from Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York,
said Chinese authorities are also subject to pressure from
exporters who want to keep the yuan low against the dollar. 
China is seeking a &#8220;stable yuan&#8221; to control hot money
flows, Yao Jian, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, told
reporters today. Residential and commercial real-estate prices
in 70 cities climbed 11.7 percent in March from a year earlier,
the most since data began in 2005. 
The economy grew 11.9 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, more than the median 11.7 percent estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists. The consumer-price index
gained 2.4 percent last month, compared with 2.7 percent in
February, the statistics bureau reported today. 
Cabinet Caution 
China&#8217;s cabinet said &#8220;rapid&#8221; first-quarter growth was
largely driven by stimulus policies and a comparison with a low
level a year earlier, suggesting officials may be cautious in
ending crisis policies. 
&#8220;The environment for economic development is extremely
complex,&#8221; the cabinet said in a statement on a government Web
site yesterday evening after a meeting chaired by Premier Wen
Jiabao. &#8220;The economic rebound still faces many difficulties.&#8221; 
Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is also building as
BRIC leaders get ready to meet this week in Brasilia to discuss
boosting trade in local currency and coordinating positions on
reforming the international financial system. 
&#8220;The Americans dare to speak about this,&#8221; said Stephen
Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered Bank Plc in
Shanghai. &#8220;Other countries take a quiet line on the renminbi but
obviously those countries have exporters who would like to grow
their business as well.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised
its estimate for U.S. second-quarter economic growth to 3
percent from 2 percent and dropped its forecast for the jobless
rate to climb past 10 percent. 
U.S. unemployment will be in a range of 9.5 percent to 10
percent through the end of 2011, Ed McKelvey, the company&#8217;s
senior U.S. economist, wrote in an e-mail. The unemployment rate
was 9.7 percent in March. 
Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable investment bank,
is sticking to its view that GDP growth will slow to a 1.5
percent pace during the second half of 2010, according to the
report. 
&#8220;While our expectations for overall growth beyond mid-year
have not changed, we have modestly upgraded our forecast for
consumer spending, with offsets in housing activity, state and
local spending, trade improvement, and inventory accumulation,&#8221;
wrote McKelvey, who is based in New York.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as U.S. regulators sued the
firm for fraud related to subprime-mortgage securities. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs rose the most in a
year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the
bank misstated and omitted key facts about collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market started to falter in 2007. The SEC&#8217;s charges are
&#8220;completely unfounded,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire. 
Swaps on other banks, from Deutsche Bank AG to Citigroup
Inc. and Morgan Stanley, also rose on concerns the probe may
bolster efforts in Washington to crack down on the securities
industry.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It creates uncertainty,&#8221; said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit
analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. &#8220;The real point is how it
affects regulation and oversight of the securities industry. It
does give Washington more ammunition to tighten regulation.&#8221; 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman climbed 35 basis points to
130.5 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. 
Swaps on Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank rose 9.5 basis
points to 93.5 basis points, the most in a year, CMA prices
show. Contracts on Morgan Stanley jumped 17.5 to 139, those on
Citigroup rose 14 to 137, and swaps on Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch unit increased 18.5 to 141. 
Ripple Effects 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s headline risk, and it&#8217;s not good for the whole
sector,&#8221; said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economics
research at Stamford, Connecticut-based Aladdin Capital Holdings
LLC, which oversees $12.5 billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s like someone took a
giant stone and threw it into a pond, and it&#8217;s going to ripple
outward.&#8221; 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
the most in 10 weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 87.3
basis points, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The benchmark yesterday reached the lowest since Jan. 14
after declining for the sixth straight day, CMA prices show. The
index typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates and
falls as it improves.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by U.S. regulators for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations that contributed to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The firm&#8217;s shares tumbled 13 percent and
financial stocks slumped. 
Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said today. Billionaire John
Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade and wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs
vice president who helped create the CDOs, known as Abacus. 
&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was
betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which
mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while
telling other investors that the securities were selected by an
independent, objective third party.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs became emblematic of public outrage at the
banking industry after posting a record $13.4 billion
profit in 2009, a year after receiving $10 billion in
taxpayer aid during the financial crisis. It repaid the
funds in June. The company, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has been criticized by lawmakers
and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in
helping Greece mask the size of its debts. It called the SEC&#8217;s
claims &#8220;unfounded.&#8221; 
Financial Stocks Slump 
&#8220;Civil charges and the disgorgement are not the issue --
the threat to Goldman is reputational,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The danger is
to &#8220;ultimately its market share with its prized institutional
and corporate clients.&#8221; 
Shares of Goldman Sachs, based in New York, dropped $23.57,
or 13 percent, to $160.70 as of 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading. It marked the biggest one-day decline since
Jan. 20, 2009, and pushed the value of Warren Buffett&#8217;s options
to buy Goldman Sachs shares down by $950 million. 
Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Integrity&#8217; 
Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s chief executive officer,
got the warrants on $5 billion of Goldman Sachs stock as part of
an agreement that extended financing to the bank during the
depths of the 2008 credit crisis. The deal reflected Buffett&#8217;s
belief in &#8220;not just the strength of Goldman but its
integrity,&#8221; Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director said this week
in an interview. 
The cost to protect against a default on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
debt jumped 30.5 basis points, or 0.305 percentage point, to
120.5 basis points. 
&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s charges are completely unfounded in law and
fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and
its reputation,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. 
The firm put together the Abacus deal in 2007, a year in
which Goldman Sachs earned a then-record $11.6 billion, a figure
it surpassed in 2009, when it earned $13.4 billion. Goldman
Sachs paid Blankfein $68.5 million for 2007 -- $600,000 in
salary, plus a $67.9 million bonus. 
According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Tourre, now 31, sent an
e-mail to a friend in January 2007 saying, &#8220;The whole building
is about to collapse&#8221; in reference to CDOs tied to subprime
mortgages. 
&#8216;Fabulous Fab&#8217; 
&#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab standing in the
middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he
created without necessarily understanding all of the
implications of those monstrousities!!!&#8221; Tourre wrote in the e-
mail, according to the SEC. The agency didn&#8217;t identify the
recipient of the note. 
Reached at his London office today, Tourre declined to
comment. &#8220;I need to jump, thank you, goodbye,&#8221; he told
Bloomberg News before hanging up. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a
lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. Tourre,
a graduate of Ecole Centrale Paris, one of France&#8217;s top
engineering schools, and Stanford University, joined Goldman
Sachs in July 2001, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
Goldman Sachs and Tourre knew it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to sell the CDO if they disclosed to investors that
Paulson played a significant role in selecting the collateral
and was also betting against it, the SEC said. 
&#8216;Surreal&#8217; ACA Meeting 
The bank also knew that at least one potential investor,
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t
likely to invest in a CDO that didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager
to analyze and select the portfolio, according to the complaint. 
In January 2007, Goldman Sachs approached ACA Management
LLC, a firm that analyzes credit risk, to select the portfolio
for a CDO transaction sponsored by Paulson. In an internal memo
on March 12, 2007, Goldman said it would &#8220;leverage ACA&#8217;s
credibility and franchise&#8221; to help distribute the transaction,
the SEC said. 
Paulson, Tourre and a representative from ACA met in
February 2007 to discuss assets that would be included in the
residential-mortgage backed security, the SEC said. While
Paulson and Tourre knew Paulson intended to short the security,
ACA wasn&#8217;t in the loop. 
&#8220;I am at this ACA meeting,&#8221; Tourre wrote in an e-mail to
an unidentified Goldman Sachs employee during the meeting.
&#8220;This is surreal.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Extensive Disclosure&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs also said that it lost more than $90 million
because it had an investment in the deal, overwhelming the $15
million it made in fees. The firm said it provided &#8220;extensive
disclosure&#8221; to IKB and ACA about the risk of the underlying
mortgage securities. Goldman Sachs never told ACA that Paulson
was going to be a &#8220;long&#8221; investor in Abacus, and ACA selected
the underlying securities, the firm said. 
Paulson  Co., which oversees $32 billion, said in a
statement that the fund didn&#8217;t make any misrepresentations
connected to the Abacus deal. 
&#8220;While Paulson purchased credit protection from Goldman
Sachs on securities issued under the Abacus ABS CDO program we
were not involved in the marketing of any Abacus products to any
third parties,&#8221; the New York-based firm said. &#8220;ACA as
collateral manager had sole authority over the selection of all
collateral in the CDO.&#8221; 
Paulson could be the target of investor lawsuits now that
the SEC is investigating how Abacus was put together, said
Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for two bond insurers
and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin Krieg  Adams LLP. 
&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been many investor lawsuits on these kinds
of deals,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;This opens the door to civil claims
across a number of transactions.&#8221; 
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost at
least 4 percent today as all 27 companies in the SP 500
Diversified Financial Index declined. In Europe, Deutsche Bank
AG dropped 8 percent. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of

     April 16 (Bloomberg) --&#160;For bearish options traders, the
Securities and Exchange Commission couldn&#8217;t have picked a better
day to charge Goldman Sachs Group Inc. with fraud. 
Puts giving the right to sell Goldman shares at $175 before
today&#8217;s close, which were worth 3 cents yesterday, soared to
$14.15 for the biggest gain among options on the stock. Goldman
shares fell 13 percent to $160.70 in New York. 
&#8220;Everything moves in an exponential manner on expiration
day when you have unexpected news like this,&#8221; said Steve Quirk,
managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. in
Chicago. &#8220;This is a very good example of why you cover short
options even if they&#8217;re worthless and 10 or 20 percent away from
the current trading price near expiration.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs plunged the most in almost three months after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New York-
based firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations
that contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
The April $165 puts jumped to $4 from 1 cent yesterday.
Those contracts traded more than 29,000 times, almost double the
number of outstanding options before today.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, said it completed the world&#8217;s longest well from a
fixed offshore platform, boosting production off California. 
The well from the Heritage platform in federal waters west
of Santa Barbara reaches 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) below sea
level and extends 6.3 miles (10 kilometers) horizontally,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil said today in a statement. 
Output from the well in the Santa Inez field will be
equivalent to 5.8 million barrels of oil, enough for the annual
energy consumption of about 144,000 Californians, the company
said. Exxon Mobil and environmental groups in 1995 agreed on
measures to protect people and marine life during exploration
from its existing platforms in Santa Inez. 
The company said in a Feb. 1 conference call that the well
had been drilled a total of more than 37,000 feet, a North
American record. 
Exxon Mobil fell 33 cents to $67.93 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed
for the year.

General Growth Properties Inc. is
seeking a higher price, fewer stock warrants or both from
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. after its bankruptcy exit plan
was matched by Simon Property Group Inc., a person with
knowledge of the discussions said. 
General Growth, the second-biggest U.S. mall owner, also is
continuing to talk with larger rival Simon, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the discussions are private.
General Growth needs to decide if it will continue to back
Brookfield&#8217;s plan before a bankruptcy court hearing on the
competing proposals, scheduled for April 29. 
Simon, whose $10 billion takeover offer for General Growth
was turned down as too low in February, earlier this week
pledged to invest $2.5 billion in a reorganization of the
company and match the terms of a plan by Brookfield and partners
Fairholme Capital Management LLC and Pershing Square Capital
Management LP. Simon said its proposal is better for General
Growth shareholders than the Brookfield plan because it doesn&#8217;t
include issuing warrants that may dilute stock value. 
Brookfield &#8220;is averse to participating in bidding wars and
may not currently feel that it has to,&#8221; Cedrik Lachance, a
senior analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach,
California, wrote in a note to investors last night. &#8220;However,
the mathematics of recapitalizing GGP at higher prices suggests
that there is room for a higher bid.&#8221; 
Hedge fund Paulson  Co. pledged to invest $1 billion as
part of the proposal by Indianapolis-based Simon. General Growth
said this week that it will study the new offer. 
Katherine Vyse, a spokeswoman for Brookfield, declined to
comment, as did Hugh Burns, a Simon spokesman. 
Business Plan 
To win backing from General Growth, Simon needs to explain
its planned strategy for the company, the person familiar with
the talks said. Given that Simon would own a large stake in its
biggest rival, akin to Coca-Cola Co. investing in PepsiCo Inc.,
the company needs to lay out details of its multi-year business
plan for General Growth, the person said. 
Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner, said this week it&#8217;s
still willing to buy Chicago-based General Growth outright. The
$6.55 billion plan by the Brookfield-led group seeks so-called
stalking horse status at the April 29 hearing and would include
issuing stock warrants if the proposal is approved by the court,
increasing the price of any future takeover by another bidder. 
Independent Company 
General Growth would emerge from bankruptcy as an
independent company under both the Brookfield plan and Simon&#8217;s
new offer. The mall owner filed the largest real estate
bankruptcy in U.S. history one year ago after amassing $27
billion in debt making acquisitions. Its properties include New
York&#8217;s South Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand
Canal Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
Simon would buy 250 million shares at $10 each under its
new offer, which it said is the same amount Toronto-based
Brookfield would acquire under its plan and at the same price.
It would also agree to the same terms as Brookfield&#8217;s proposal
for the recapitalization of the company and planned spinoff of a
new entity, David Simon wrote in an April 14 letter to General
Growth CEO Adam Metz.

JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Vedika
Bhandarkar will join Credit Suisse Group AG as vice chairman
and head of investment banking operations in India, the Wall
Street bank&#8217;s second senior departure in the country in a month. 
Credit Suisse also hired JPMorgan&#8217;s Sandeep Pangal who will
report to Bhandarkar as a managing director, spokesman Adam
Harper said by phone today. Bhandarkar will report to Mihir
Doshi, Credit Suisse&#8217;s India head. 
Zurich-based Credit Suisse, which ranks 24th in advising
Indian stock sales, aims to grow the business tapping rising
investor demand for equities in the country. JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost the vice chairman of
its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last month after she left to
become country head for Bank of America Corp. 
&#8220;India is central to our strategy and we are confident
that Vedika and Sandeep can build on our momentum to take the
business to the next level,&#8221; Vikram Malhotra, Credit Suisse&#8217;s
co-head of investment banking for Asia Pacific, said in an e-
mail. 
Bhandarkar joined JPMorgan in India in 1998 and Pangal
joined the following year. While at JPMorgan the two worked
together advising on deals including NTT DoCoMo Inc.&#8217;s $2.7
billion stake in Tata Teleservices Ltd. in 2008. 
So far this year, JPMorgan is No. 8 in advising on stock
sales in India, behind firms including Citigroup Inc., UBS AG,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg
data show. 
Bhandarkar will also report to Vikram Malhotra and Helman
Sitohang, co-heads of investment banking for Asia Pacific, based
in Hong Kong and Singapore respectively.

Bo Vavrusa was heaping dirt into
the path of a wildfire on a Texas ranch in October 2007 when his
tractor rammed an Exxon Mobil Corp. natural-gas pipe hidden in a
thicket. Flames engulfed the tractor, burning his face, arms and
hands as he fled. 
&#8220;I thought I was fixing to die,&#8221; said Vavrusa, 28, who
was earning $10 an hour to groom the ranch for quail and dove
hunters. 
Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil producer, has neglected this
stretch of Texas since its oil fields began drying up in the
1970s, said Jerry Patterson, the state&#8217;s General Land Office
Commissioner. Now Patterson and other state officials are urging
Texas lawmakers to follow the examples of California and
Pennsylvania in cracking down on oilfield practices that have
left leaking pipelines, wells and storage tanks. 
Oozing chemical pits and Vavrusa&#8217;s scarred skin are
emblematic of a legacy Exxon has sought to keep buried in court,
even as it gears up for a return to active exploration within
miles of the ranch through its pending $29.3 billion acquisition
of Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy Inc. 
Exxon&#8217;s renewed focus on North America follows nationalist
energy policies in Venezuela and Russia that reduced
opportunities to profit abroad. It coincides with fresh scrutiny
in the U.S. that is leading Congress to examine whether stricter
drilling regulations are needed. 
Oil&#8217;s &#8216;Ugly Side&#8217; 
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t something the states are proud to advertise,&#8221;
said Philip Dellinger, chief of the groundwater section in the
Austin, Texas, office of the Environmental Protection Agency.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the ugly side of the oil and gas business.&#8221; 
The EPA says it has no authority to force companies to
address contamination on active fields and must defer to Texas
regulators, who let oil companies determine if sites need
cleanup. 
In Pennsylvania, where the petroleum industry was born with
Edwin Drake&#8217;s 1859 discovery of crude, Governor Ed Rendell more
than doubled the number of well inspectors and has asked the
legislature to impose more than $400 million in new taxes on
companies pumping gas from the Marcellus Shale, a geologic
formation that extends from New York to Ohio and holds enough of
the fuel to supply the entire U.S. for 15 years. 
&#8220;I think the whole future of oil and gas in this country
depends on the companies having to pick up the last mess,&#8221; said
Elizabeth Burns, 43, who lives with her family on the Encinitos
Ranch where Vavrusa was injured. &#8220;Places like Pennsylvania and
New York need strong laws or this is what they&#8217;re going to
get.&#8221; 
Depression-Era Leases 
Relatives of Burns and her husband, Stephen, own the ranch
and much of the Kelsey oilfield beneath it. They&#8217;ve filed a
lawsuit against Exxon and Chevron Corp., which pumps oil and gas
on a smaller section of the spread. The suit accuses the
companies of damaging tens of thousands of acres and failing to
abide by 1930s-era leases they say require operators to keep
equipment clear of vegetation. 
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it spent $1.6 million last
year on remediation at the ranch and has conducted numerous soil
and water tests to mitigate environmental risks. 
&#8220;We are a responsible operator and refute any accusations
that suggest otherwise,&#8221; said David Eglinton, an Exxon
spokesman. &#8220;We currently have crews working to remove unneeded
facilities and, where appropriate, remediate affected areas to
applicable regulatory standards.&#8221; 
Chevron, the largest U.S. oil company after Exxon, &#8220;denies
these unsubstantiated allegations and intends to defend itself
in the litigation,&#8221; said Mickey Driver, a spokesman for the San
Ramon, California-based company. 
Expensive Slog 
If a judge finds Exxon and Chevron liable, they could be on
the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars, based on cleanup
costs incurred at other companies&#8217; oil fields in California. The
lawsuit is going to be an expensive slog, said Jeff Weems, a
Houston-based oil and gas lawyer who has represented BP PLC,
Europe&#8217;s second-biggest oil company, in Texas courts. 
&#8220;The legal route is a very long and difficult row to hoe
for an individual landowner,&#8221; said Weems, a Democrat who&#8217;s
running in November for a seat on the commission that regulates
the Texas oil and natural-gas industry. &#8220;They generally don&#8217;t
have the resources to seriously take on the big oil companies
that have legal departments that rival the largest law firms in
size and quality.&#8221; 
The Encinitos spread, located 40 miles from the Mexican
border, is dotted with scores of still-active gas pipes obscured
by brush and saplings that haven&#8217;t been cut. Beneath the dirt,
the Burns family has found leaks and dumps they blame for
undrinkable water and dead trees. 
Defunct Equipment 
Pollution from decades-old wells and waste pits isn&#8217;t
isolated to their ranch or Exxon. There are more than 100,000
old wells in Texas that haven&#8217;t been capped and thousands of
defunct gas-processing plants, compressor stations and related
equipment that have never been dismantled, according to the
Texas Land and Minerals Owners Association, which represents
1,200 ranchers, farmers and individuals who own stakes in oil
and gas fields. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty common problem in Texas,&#8221; said John B.
McFarland, an oil and gas attorney at Graves Dougherty Hearon 
Moody in Austin who has represented landowners with claims to
300,000 acres around the state. 
In Benavides, a rural town 60 miles north of the Burns&#8217;s
homestead, local officials sent residents letters in late 2008
warning them their drinking water contains as much as four-and-
a-half times as much arsenic as is considered safe by the U.S.
EPA. Arsenic can cause skin damage, circulatory problems and
cancer, the letter warned. 
Contamination Migrates 
The contamination may have migrated from a defunct oilfield
on the north end of town, where sludge and other waste from
wells was dumped in open dirt pits for decades, said J.T.
Garcia, president of the Duval County Conservation and
Reclamation District. He doesn&#8217;t know who operated the field,
which stopped pumping crude in the 1970s. 
The Burns&#8217;s ranch, which covers an area equal to the size
of Brooklyn, is just one example of the lingering environmental
damage across swaths of south, west and east Texas from what
were once regarded as acceptable oilfield practices, said
Patterson, the commissioner with the Texas General Land Office,
which oversees oil leases that help fund the state&#8217;s schools and
universities. 
&#8220;They&#8217;d just dig a pit and put the oil in it and then
they&#8217;d haul it off later, or maybe they wouldn&#8217;t haul it off
later, depending on the price of oil at the time,&#8221; said
Patterson. &#8220;That was the norm, and nobody said anything about
it.&#8221; 
Heavy Metals 
During the 1950s and &#8216;60s, oil companies filtered out some
byproducts at the wellhead and dumped the refuse in dirt pits.
That meant contaminants later buried when bulldozers covered the
holes had higher concentrations of petroleum-laced substances
and heavy metals than they otherwise would have, according to
the Burnses and an environmental survey of the ranch carried out
by Amistad Environmental LLC at the behest of the family&#8217;s
lawyers. 
Exxon, which pumps more oil than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, declined to discuss the
Burns lawsuit. The company has paid the family $19 million over
the past two decades in the form of royalties, Eglinton said.
Exxon has invested $190 million in development of the field
since the lease was signed in 1935, extracting 130 million
barrels of crude and 980 billion cubic feet of gas during that
time. 
The company&#8217;s presence in south Texas has enriched ranchers
and their communities, Eglinton said. Exxon paid $890 million in
taxes and royalties to the state in 2008, and Brooks County,
where the largest chunk of the Encinitos Ranch sits, relies on
oil and other mineral taxes for 70 percent of its school and
local government budgets, he said. 
Price of Pollution 
Those benefits came with a price measured in pollution that
has languished, partly because state laws and regulatory
agencies aren&#8217;t designed or equipped to police environmental
performance in the oil patch, said Weems and other critics. 
The Texas Railroad Commission that oversees the state&#8217;s oil
and natural-gas industry allows companies to hire their own
environmental consultants to check for contamination. Tests on
the Burns property conducted for Exxon by Netherlands-based
Arcadis NV gave the site a clean bill of health, said Ramona
Nye, a spokeswoman for the Austin-based commission. 
Elizabeth Burns had a different assessment. 
&#8220;They buried it, muck and all,&#8221; she said. 
Jeanna Blatt, a Highlands Ranch, Colorado-based spokeswoman
for Arcadis, declined to comment. 
OPEC&#8217;s Predecessor 
The railroad commission, created in 1891 to regulate
shipping rates, had its authority expanded to the nascent Texas
oil industry in the early 1900s, when rampant drilling glutted
world markets with crude and prices tumbled. 
The commission began restricting how much each well in the
state could produce, in a bid to prevent another free-fall in
prices. When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
was formed in 1960, the railroad commission was its model,
according to the Texas State Historical Association. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a mistake to have an agency that was originally set
up to serve the industry now being asked to police the industry
as its environmental regulator,&#8221; said McFarland, the oil and
gas attorney. 
The Texas legislature isn&#8217;t inclined to crack down on the
oil industry either, said Kelly Mcbeth, a legislative strategist
at Texas Energy Lobby, an Austin-based firm that represents
petroleum companies. Even wells that produce just a trickle of
oil or gas are revenue generators for the state. 
&#8216;An Economic Driver&#8217; 
&#8220;Legislators do everything they can to keep those wells on
line,&#8221; Mcbeth said. &#8220;They&#8217;re an economic driver for us.&#8221; 
The EPA doesn&#8217;t intervene in pollution cases on active
oilfields in Texas, said Dave Bary, a spokesman for EPA Region
6, which encompasses Texas, four other states and 65 American
Indian tribes. 
&#8220;The railroad commission has primacy over active
oilfields,&#8221; Bary said. 
Exxon, which had 2009 sales of $276 billion that dwarfed
the economic output of all but 33 of the world&#8217;s nations, wants
to seal the records in the Burns lawsuit, filed in December
2007. If Judge Richard C. Terrell of Texas&#8217;s 79th Judicial
District grants the company&#8217;s request, it would shield from
public view the details of how the company has operated on the
land. 
&#8220;The mindset of a major oil company is that they shouldn&#8217;t
have to compromise and you should be scared of them,&#8221; said
Roger S. Braugh Jr., the Sico, White, Hoelscher  Braugh LLC
attorney representing the Burns family. &#8220;To prove our case,
ultimately we&#8217;re looking at spending tens of millions of dollars
on environmental studies.&#8221; 
Off the Land 
The suit demands unspecified cleanup costs and seeks to kick
the oil companies off the land for breaching leases signed in
the 1930s, said Braugh, who&#8217;s based in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Vavrusa, the former ranch hand who now works for a company
that tests pipeline meters, sued Exxon and the ranch for
unspecified damages. Exxon failed to cut the vegetation that hid
the gas line from view, and the ranch family didn&#8217;t warn him the
line was there, he claimed in his suit. 
Exxon&#8217;s Eglinton said it was premature for the company to
comment on that suit. 
Cleaning up a contaminated oil patch involves either
excavating the soil and trucking it away, or fencing off the
area to keep people out, said John Evans, chief civil engineer
for Cannon Associates, a San Luis Obispo, California-based
remediation firm. 
California Cleaning 
In California, the third-biggest oil-producing state after
Texas and Alaska, state agencies and regulators have been
pushing oil companies to clean up old fields. 
Unocal Corp. was forced to spend $100 million to dig up a
half-mile of oceanfront and to demolish and rebuild eight blocks
of Avila Beach, California, starting in 1995 after subterranean
pipelines leaked crude, gasoline and diesel, said Evans, who
worked on the project. 
The cleanup stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, according to a Unocal
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A yacht
club, retail stores and pier had to be rebuilt at the company&#8217;s
expense. Unocal is now part of Chevron. 
At another former Unocal operation in California, the
state&#8217;s Department of Fish and Game, the water quality board and
the Department of Toxic Substances Control successfully sued the
company over contamination of the Guadalupe field 160 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, public filings showed. 
Kerosene Leaks 
The cleanup so far has cost $200 million to $300 million
since digging began in 1994, Evans said. Before the field was
shut in the mid 1990s, Unocal used kerosene to loosen deposits
of thick crude. The kerosene pipes leaked, polluting the soil
and flowing into the ocean, he said. 
Eglinton, the Exxon spokesman, said the Unocal cleanups in
California may have little in common with conditions in south
Texas. &#8220;These are two completely different places,&#8221; he said. 
In Pennsylvania, the state has responded to a boom in gas
drilling by Exxon and others with stepped-up inspections of well
sites. The intent is to ensure the holes are properly lined with
steel pipe and concrete to protect local water supplies from
chemicals used to penetrate rock formations and saltwater that
gurgles to the surface with the gas, said John Hanger, secretary
of the state&#8217;s Department of Environmental Protection. 
Pennsylvania Scars 
&#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s had a long, long history with natural-
resources extraction, going back some 300 years with coal and an
oil industry that began in the 1800s,&#8221; said Hanger, who before
heading the agency was CEO of Citizens for Pennsylvania&#8217;s
Future, a non-profit group that promotes renewable energy and
conservation. &#8220;Those industries left some scars on the natural
landscape, and we&#8217;re still paying considerable sums of money to
repair some of that damage.&#8221; 
From the 1930s through the 1970s, the Kelsey field in south
Texas attracted hundreds of roughnecks, engineers and their
families. They lived in a work camp that had gardens, a school,
swim club and the Cactus Club snack bar that specialized in
wood-smoked barbecue, the Burnses said. 
Humble Oil and Texaco, which were subsumed into Exxon and
Chevron, drilled 555 wells on the ranch and laid thousands of
miles of pipe to funnel crude to refineries in other parts of
Texas. 
Poisonous Toads 
Today the Encinitos Ranch, which sprawls across parts of
three counties, is home to poisonous Marine toads and
rattlesnakes. The fat brown toads, when captured, are tossed
into a pond to prevent the household dogs from eating them and
dying; rattlesnakes are shot and hung over a fence for good
luck. The dogs have scars from fighting with coyotes. 
Stephen Burns, 39, wears a holstered handgun around the
ranch for protection against drug smugglers who avoid Border
Patrol agents prowling the highways by following pipeline routes
that crisscross the property. 
His wife, Elizabeth, estimates Exxon has damaged 12,000 to
14,000 acres of the 31,000 acres it holds under the 1935 lease
by burying wastes left by oil production and allowing byproducts
to leak into the soil. Chevron has damaged about 4,000 of the
7,100 acres it operates under a lease that dates to 1934, she
said. 
Her first clash with Exxon had nothing to do with oil. In
October 2006, police discovered that a Mexico-based drug cartel
was using the abandoned Cactus Club as a way-station for
couriers armed with machine guns. The authorities asked the
Burns to have Exxon tear it down. 
The company declined the family&#8217;s requests, Burns said. 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil can&#8217;t comment on the alleged 2006 request as
we don&#8217;t have any information about it,&#8221; said Margaret Ross, a
spokeswoman. &#8220;There is no current request from the landowner.&#8221; 
Bubbling Road 
Burns began to focus on the decaying oilfield
infrastructure after a second wildfire in March 2008 scorched
most of the landscape, exposing the rusty pipes and other aging
equipment spanning the ranch. That same month, an asphalt road
on the ranch that ran alongside a former oil-storage site began
to bubble with petroleum gases. Burns said she complained to
Exxon and to the railroad commission. 
Four months later, she triggered a radiation sensor clipped
to the belt of a U.S. Border Patrol agent at McAllen Miller
International Airport before boarding a flight to Houston. The
agent determined the culprit was dirt on the soles of her boots
laced with old crude and chemicals tracked in from the ranch.
Since then, she said, she&#8217;s been calling and emailing the
railroad commission about twice a week with contamination
complaints. 
Addressing Concerns 
&#8220;Commission staff is in regular contact with Elizabeth
Burns and has been working with her since November 2008 to
address her concerns,&#8221; Nye said in an e-mailed statement. 
A &#8220;majority&#8221; of Burns&#8217; complaints have been &#8220;addressed
and resolved,&#8221; Nye said. The five that remain open involve
storage tank and pipeline leaks that the commission is
monitoring &#8220;to assure that cleanups are completed within a
reasonable time frame,&#8221; the spokeswoman said. 
After the Burnses complained, Exxon dug up the road, which
crossed a network of 44 pipelines. In October, a 9-foot deep
hole about the size of a two-car garage remained, with a pool of
brown muck at the bottom that had the smell and tell-tale
rainbow sheen of petroleum. 
Fifty yards from where the road once ran, Stephen Burns
used a backhoe to dig a 6-foot trench in the soil. Within
seconds, a clear liquid that reeked of motor fuel trickled down
the sides of the hole. A clump of the dirt felt and smelled like
the boggy sand that is mined for oil in Alberta, Canada. 
Exxon filled in the bubbling-road hole in December and
covered it with caliche, Burns said. 
Benzene Found 
The survey done in 2008 for the family found dangerously
high levels of petroleum derivatives such as benzene, as well as
mercury and lead, in soil and water samples from the surface to
at least 40 feet down. 
The family stopped using its tap water after seeing those
results. Now they get their water once a week in 5-gallon jugs
from a Farm and Ranch store in San Isidro, Texas, about 40 miles
away. 
Although lighter-weight hydrocarbons can degrade naturally
in 40 or 50 years, the heavier molecules &#8220;are more persistent
and pretty toxic,&#8221; said Gregory Miller, project manager at Icon
Environmental Services Inc., a Port Allen, Louisiana-based
company that cleans up old oilfields. &#8220;You have no idea how bad
some of these sites are.&#8221; 
Daunting Task 
Patterson said cleaning up a tract as large as the
Encinitos Ranch is impossible. Instead, the best solution may be
to fence it off and monitor the pollution to ensure it doesn&#8217;t
migrate underground to other ranches. 
&#8220;We need to somehow encapsulate it, monitor it, clean up
the obvious hazards, whether they&#8217;re fire hazards, whether
they&#8217;re leakage hazards,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you
can totally remediate that many acres. It&#8217;s not doable. It&#8217;s
just too big.&#8221; 
Exxon has installed water-monitoring stations at the ranch,
said Eglinton, the company spokesman. He declined to release the
results of the tests performed thus far. 
Oil companies would be better off cleaning up their old
operations in south Texas, Patterson said, rather than waiting
for regulators or the state legislature to impose a solution. 
&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s walked away from a lot of this stuff they built
here, but the evil lurks,&#8221; said Burns, who had planned to raise
organic vegetables when she and her husband moved to the ranch
with their sons five years ago. &#8220;You&#8217;d hope your kids can do
something with this land, but now it&#8217;s worthless.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. is near an
agreement to sell its Miramax film unit in a deal that would put
brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein back in charge of the studio
they founded, said a person with knowledge of the plan. 
The Weinsteins, who are working with billionaire Ron
Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa Cos., entered into exclusive negotiations with
Disney on April 16 as the sides work on a restructured proposal,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Their offer was increased to $625 million
from $600 million, the person said. 
A deal would reunite the Weinsteins, the executives behind
&#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; and Oscar winner &#8220;The English Patient,&#8221; with
the studio they named after their parents and left in 2005 to
start Weinstein Co. Disney would replenish its coffers after
paying more than $4 billion for comic-book publisher Marvel
Entertainment. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is focusing
the movie division on family oriented movies. 
Exclusivity lasts for less than a week, the person said.
Burbank, California-based Disney acquired Miramax in 1993 and
had sought $700 million for the studio and its 700-film library.
The Weinsteins earned 220 Academy Award nominations for Disney
during their tenure, for films including &#8220;Shakespeare in
Love,&#8221; &#8220;The Aviator&#8221; and &#8220;Life Is Beautiful.&#8221; 
Colbeck Capital Management and Fortress Investment Group
are providing funding for the Miramax offer, The New York Times
reported on April 16. The exclusive talks were reported earlier
by TheWrap.com. 
Gores Brothers 
Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman for New York-based Weinstein
Co., declined to comment. Frank Quintero, a spokesman for
Burkle&#8217;s Los Angeles-based Yucaipa, didn&#8217;t return messages
seeking comment. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, said in January
that it closed Miramax offices, and that it would distribute the
six remaining pictures. The Weinsteins founded the company in
1979 and named it after their parents, Miriam and Max. 
Alec Gores and Tom Gores, billionaires who each run Los
Angeles-based private equity companies, have raised their bid
above the $550 million originally offered, said one person. They
are being advised by their brother Sam Gores, owner of Paradigm
Talent Agency in Beverly Hills, California. 
A spokesman for the Gores, Michael Sitrick, declined to
comment. 
Hollywood film producer David Bergstein has also offered
about $650 million, according to two people with knowledge of
the bid. 
Bergstein is advising a &#8220;well-capitalized offshore
entity&#8221; on a Miramax bid, his Pangea Media Group said in on
April 8. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 57 cents to
$35.83 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on April 16.
Its shares have climbed 11 percent this year.

International Business Machines
Corp. said service contract signings fell last quarter,
suggesting corporate customers are still delaying some
technology spending following the economic slowdown. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Application-management
signings declined 23 percent. 
IBM shares have lagged behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index this year. The company, the world&#8217;s largest computer-
services provider, has yet to signal that its profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than by measures like cost cuts
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; said Marshall, who has a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the stock and doesn&#8217;t own it. &#8220;IBM is simply
not that attractive of a growth story right now.&#8221; 
IBM fell 2.2 percent to $129.35 in after-hours trading
after rising $1.60 to $132.23 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange. It has gained 1 percent this year, compared with a 7.4
percent gain in the SP 500. 
Excluding the decline in application-management signings,
total services signings would have been up 4 percent from a year
earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s slower growth than the 9
percent increase in the fourth quarter. 
Stock Buybacks 
Since 2002, IBM has repurchased $68.5 billion of stock to
help buoy profit. The buyback program shows &#8220;really good
financial management from an earnings perspective,&#8221; Marshall
said. &#8220;At the end of the day -- not much upside from a revenue
perspective.&#8221; 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221;
and doesn&#8217;t own any. 
IBM has cut about 2,900 jobs this year, according to
advocacy group Alliance@IBM, which represents some employees.
That&#8217;s on top on the more than 10,400 let go in the U.S. and
Canada last year, the group said, as the company coped with a
drop in sales. 
2010 Forecast 
The company should benefit as technology spending climbs
1.7 percent this year, after a 3.1 percent last year, according
to a projection from Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest
chipmaker, lent support to that prediction last week by
forecasting second-quarter sales that topped estimates. 
Full-year profit at IBM will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share, the company said.
Analysts on average estimated $11.13 based on estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in higher-
margin software and services. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross
profit margins, the percentage of revenue left after production
costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Software and services now make up more than 80 percent of
total revenue, which was $95.8 billion last year. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. The U.S. government&#8217;s plan to put patient health
records online may spur more than $20 billion in spending,
Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said.

It&#8217;s not just the profits that pile
up at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. So do the scandals. 
Over the last year, the bank has been beaten up in the
court of public opinion. Last week&#8217;s fraud charges from the
Securities and Exchange Commission merely added to the battering
its reputation has already taken. Most of us would rather own up
to working for a tobacco company, with subsidiaries in landmine
manufacturing, than have anything to do with Goldman. 
It is well on the way to becoming the world&#8217;s most hated
company. And yet, there is an interesting twist to this tale.
Among the people who probably matter to it most, Goldman Sachs
is doing better than ever. 
Smart, ambitious graduates are still sending in their CVs
as enthusiastically as ever. The big corporations still want the
New York-based firm on their side. And it posted record earnings
in 2009 while its stock price doubled. 
There is a lesson in that for Wall Street investment banks.
While spending millions on an army of public-relations officers,
reputation consultants and sponsorship managers, financial
institutions shouldn&#8217;t forget that people prefer their bankers
to be greedy and mean. Being known for having sharp teeth, along
with a nasty bark, won&#8217;t do you any harm. None of the scandals
has hurt its business. This latest one won&#8217;t be any different. 
Public Beating 
No one can have failed to notice the beating that bankers
have taken in public opinion in the past two years. Real-estate
agents have a better reputation for honesty, and parking
inspectors have a higher rating for fairness. 
No surprises there. The banks took huge and crazy risks,
got ordinary taxpayers to bail them out, then went straight back
to paying themselves massive bonuses as if nothing had happened.
If that doesn&#8217;t send your reputation straight into the gutter,
it is hard to know what will. 
There is plenty of statistical evidence to show banks have
plummeted in public esteem. In Harris Interactive&#8217;s latest
survey of corporate reputations in the U.S., the banks took a
hammering. Out of 60 companies, Goldman Sachs ranked 56th.
Citigroup Inc. was at 57th, while Bank of America Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. were also in the bottom 10. Only the
tobacco industry fared worse than finance. You can&#8217;t sink much
lower than that. 
That, however, is what Joe Public thinks. Among the
corporate and political elite the story is rather different. 
Top of Polls 
A British survey, conducted by the graduate-recruitment Web
site TargetJobs, asked 100,000 students which companies they
would like to work for when they graduate. Goldman Sachs topped
the poll for investment banks. All that terrible press, it
seems, hasn&#8217;t stopped young people wanting to get their feet
under a desk in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offices. 
Likewise, Fortune magazine recently published its annual
survey of the most-admired companies. Who topped the megabank
category? That&#8217;s right. Goldman Sachs. It was up from 15th to
eighth place in the all-industries ranking, ahead of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. 
Fortune canvasses the views of more than 4,000 executives,
directors and analysts to compile its list. It is a measure of
elite, not mass opinion. And in that narrow world, it appears
that the big banks haven&#8217;t suffered at all. 
The message couldn&#8217;t be clearer. An avalanche of bad
publicity hasn&#8217;t really dented Goldman&#8217;s reputation, or that of
any other major bank, either. 
Nasty and Tough 
There are two conclusions to be drawn from that. 
First, we like our banks to be aggressive and mean. Imagine
you were hiring a bodyguard or a divorce lawyer. Do you want one
who promises to be conciliatory, kind and consensual? Or one who
takes no prisoners? In reality, you want your team to be as
nasty and tough as possible. The same is true of investment
banking. As gangster rappers say, it pays to be bad. 
Second, although there is a lot of waffling about
reputation and corporate social responsibility, all that matters
is the ability to get the job done. The firm of Nero, Khan (as
in Genghis)  Capone would probably win a fair bit of business
as long as it got that Greek bond issue sold, or found someone
to unwind a position in Florida mortgage derivatives. 
There is a moral in that for the investment banks. 
They will all spend fortunes in the next couple of years
getting their images back in shape. If you happen to have an
orchestra you want sponsored, an orphanage that needs a new
wing, or a rare species that needs saving from extinction, this
is the right moment to send in a polite letter asking for a
donation. Don&#8217;t forget to mention how their generosity will
improve their public image. They will write out a check faster
than you can say &#8220;giant vampire squid.&#8221; 
Two Audiences 
But actually, for keeping the business going, there are
only two audiences that really count. 
While the banks can still attract the smartest, most
ambitious young talent out of the universities, and so long as
the people running big corporations still rate them, what the
general public thinks doesn&#8217;t matter much. 
And while the banks are repairing their images, it would
also be worth remembering that they don&#8217;t want to go too far in
the other direction. It won&#8217;t really do them any harm to be
known as nasty and greedy -- that is what bankers are there for.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Richard
Kinder and the private-equity firms that bought Kinder Morgan
Inc. in 2007 have gained at least 126 percent return on a pretax
basis from their $7.8 billion equity investment, according to
CreditSights Inc. 
Subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle Group, American
International Group Inc., Riverstone Holdings LLC and Kinder co-
founder Richard Kinder, agreed to pay $14.4 billion for the
operator of North American oil and natural-gas pipelines in
August 2006. While the deal was struck at the height of the
leveraged takeover boom, it stands out as bondholders haven&#8217;t
taken losses, said Andy DeVries, a CreditSights analyst in New
York. 
&#8220;This LBO remains one of the most unique of the 2005-07
LBO boom,&#8221; DeVries wrote in an April 18 report. In August, he
calculated the buyout equity investment had gained 69 percent. 
Kinder Morgan is the general partner of Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership that
operates or owns an interest in more than 35,000 miles of
pipelines. Chief Executive Officer Kinder and other managers at
the firm contributed $2.9 billion of the $7.8 billion equity
investment. 
Larry Pierce, a Kinder Morgan Energy Partners spokesman,
and Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls seeking comment.

The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; 
The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. 
&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; 
The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; 
 Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. 
Citigroup, WaMu 
The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy. 
Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, in response to subpoenas and document requests has
provided information to the SEC and state attorneys general in
addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who collected reports from
it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for the company in New
York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. 
&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; 
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; 
The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. 
&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; 
The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. 
Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets 
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. 
The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. 
&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; 
The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. 
&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; 
More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. 
Magnetar Deals 
Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. 
Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. 
His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. 
Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. 
Not Insisting 
Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. 
While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; 
Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. 
&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. 
Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. 
The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. 
Synthetic CDOs 
CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. 
The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Cummings, DeFazio 
Democratic Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter DeFazio said today they would ask SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro to
review whether Goldman Sachs CDOs insured by American
International Group Inc. were improperly created. AIG, rescued
by the U.S. in 2008, covered $6 billion of assets through Abacus
deals. 
Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. 
The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. 
Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. 
One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. 
&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; 
The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; 
In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. 
Goldman Sachs Response 
ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. 
&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; 
Buyer Beware 
Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. 
&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; 
Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few. 
In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. 
The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. 
&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; 
&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; 
IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. 
&#8216;Far More Sophisticated&#8217; 
&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; 
Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. 
&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said.

The cost to protect against losses
on bank bonds jumped for the second day amid speculation that
U.S. fraud charges against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may trigger
similar probes or lawsuits and embolden lawmakers&#8217; efforts to
crack down on financial firms. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman reached the highest in two
months as U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to follow the U.S. Securities
Exchange Commission and start a probe, and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said her nation&#8217;s financial regulator asked the
SEC for details on its Goldman suit. Swaps on banks including
Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG jumped. 
&#8220;If these charges are damning enough to actually cause
some instability in the markets, nobody really believes Goldman
is the only one that might be guilty here,&#8221; said Brian
Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at broker-dealer
Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
The SEC last week said New York-based Goldman sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing that a hedge fund that was betting against
the debt had helped select underlying securities. Goldman said
in a statement last week that the charges are &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; CDOs pool bonds, loans and other fixed-income
assets into securities of varying risk and return. 
Bank Swaps 
Credit swaps protecting Goldman debt for five years jumped
7 basis points to 134 basis points after earlier trading as high
as 140 basis points, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.
It&#8217;s the biggest two-day increase in a year, CMA DataVision
prices show. 
Contracts on Citigroup jumped 16 basis points to 138,
Deutsche Bank rose 4.5 to 98, Morgan Stanley climbed 17 to 153
and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit rose 18 to 159,
CMA prices show. 
&#8220;The fear is that this will make regulations even tighter,
increase the potential for fines and other judgments and push
down bank profits in the near term,&#8221; said Jeffrey Burch, co-
head of global credit at Investec Asset Management in London. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
to the highest in four weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 1.8 basis point to a mid-price of 89.13
basis points as of 11:03 a.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
Legislative Outlook 
The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies rose 3 basis points to 82.9, Markit prices show. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
The Goldman Sachs suit may embolden lawmakers who want to
hold Wall Street firms accountable for the financial crisis that
sparked the worst recession since the Great Depression, said
John Anderson, head of credit at Gartmore Investment Management
in London. 
Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, released a
bill last week that would limit derivatives trading by
commercial banks, barring dealers in swaps from taking advantage
of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount lending window, emergency
liquidity functions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s
insurance and guarantee functions. 
&#8216;Red Meat&#8217; 
President Barack Obama said in his weekly address on radio
and the Internet that his plan to overhaul U.S. financial
regulation is the only way to prevent the &#8220;turmoil that ripped
through our economy over the past two years.&#8221;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The perception was that banks were returning to
profitability and that everything in the garden was rosy,&#8221;
Anderson said. &#8220;But Obama has set his sights on the banking
community, and the regulators want some red meat.&#8221; 
Goldman&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due in 2020 are the most-
traded U.S. corporate notes today, falling 1.03 cents on the
dollar to 98.56 cents to yield 178 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries as of 10:51 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data show. 
Citigroup said first-quarter profit more than doubled,
beating analysts&#8217; estimates as the global economic rebound
trimmed costs for bad loans and boosted revenue from consumer
banking. 
The bank&#8217;s 6.01 percent bonds due in 2015 fell 0.3 cent on
the dollar to 106 cents, a spread of 209.2 basis points, Trace
data show. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 5.5 percent notes due in 2020 declined 1.4
cent to 97.42 cents, a spread of 206.9 basis points, Trace data
show.

The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; 
The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. 
&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; 
The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; 
Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. 
Citigroup, WaMu 
The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy before the market crashed. 
Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, has provided information to the SEC and state
attorneys general in addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who
collected reports from it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for
the company in New York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. 
&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; 
&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; 
The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a
securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. 
&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; 
The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. 
Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets 
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by
John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. 
The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James
Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. 
&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; 
The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. 
&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; 
More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit,
Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. 
Magnetar Deals 
Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. 
Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. 
His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. 
Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. 
Not Insisting 
Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. 
While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; 
Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. 
&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. 
Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. 
The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. 
Synthetic CDOs 
CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. 
The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Aquarius 2006-1 
Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. 
The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. 
Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. 
One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. 
&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; 
The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; 
In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. 
ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. 
&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Goldman Sachs Response 
Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; 
Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. 
&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; 
Default Swaps 
Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. 
The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. 
&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; 
&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; 
IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. 
&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob
Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; 
Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. 
&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s fraud suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may
trigger additional probes of collateralized debt obligations and
lead to stricter regulation, analysts and academics said. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
bank created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages without
disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick
the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle. Investors
including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Germany&#8217;s IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG lost about $1 billion from the trade.
Goldman Sachs denies wrongdoing. 
&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as other
financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously very
worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it could
well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; 
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry. Regulators
may probe other CDOs that lost money for investors and could
probe other investment banks involved in the business, Raul
Sinha, a London-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in
a report published today. The suit may also strengthen political
pressure for more regulation of derivatives and similar complex
financial structures, threatening earnings, analysts said.

Just how out-of-touch can Lloyd Blankfein be? 
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive officer
vigorously denied the Securities and Exchange Commission fraud
suit filed Friday against his firm, calling the complaint
&#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; The company promised
to &#8220;defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; 
But head-in-the-sand denials will no longer work. If
Blankfein wants to save what is left of Goldman&#8217;s reputation,
and possibly his job, he should admit that the deal described in
the SEC complaint was wrong. Then, he should draw a very firm
line so that Goldman doesn&#8217;t deceive its customers again. 
As only someone from Mars doesn&#8217;t know by now, Goldman
allegedly sold collateralized debt obligations, or bonds backed
by mortgage securities, to institutional investors without
disclosing that the specific securities were handpicked by
hedge-fund manager John Paulson. Paulson was betting on the
securities to fall and, for that reason, structured the
securities to include losers -- not winners. 
For instance, he ordered that no bonds backed by Wells
Fargo  Co. mortgages be included in the pool because Wells
Fargo was one of the few mortgage lenders that stuck to sound
lending. 
Goldman says it had no idea whether the mortgage securities
would go up or down. Maybe. But the SEC complaint quotes a
Goldman employee, also named as a defendant, gleefully
chortling, &#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime
now.&#8221; By the time the deal closed, in April 2007, the subprime
market was already in trouble. Defaults were skyrocketing. And
by the following January, no fewer than 99 percent of the
mortgages in the CDO had been downgraded. 
&#8216;Paulson Portfolio&#8217; 
Goldman says it lost $90 million on the deal. If true, that
might be its strongest defense. 
However, Goldman&#8217;s investment forecast matters less than
its allegedly faulty disclosure. Internally, it referred to the
bonds at issue as &#8220;the Paulson portfolio.&#8221; But outside
investors weren&#8217;t told that this much-respected -- and much-
feared -- short-seller had selected the bonds, or even that he
was involved. Instead, Goldman recruited a neutral third party
to bless the deal, and investors were told that this party, ACA
Management LLC, had selected the mortgages. 
It might be that every fact in the SEC complaint is untrue,
in which case Blankfein is right to defend and I am dead wrong.
But the complaint is rich in detail, and builds on a book,
Gregory Zuckerman&#8217;s &#8220;The Greatest Trade Ever,&#8221; and on
exclusive reporting in the New York Times that laid out a
similar story. 
Looking Ugly 
If the SEC&#8217;s facts are true, the case is ugly for Goldman.
In capsule form: At Paulson&#8217;s urging, Goldman structured a
security so Paulson could short the mortgage market. Goldman
found patsies to take the other side, and Paulson paid the firm
a $15 million fee. 
Goldman&#8217;s behavior reminds me of NBC television, which in
1992 aired a video of a pickup truck explosion that turned out
to have been staged. After a lawsuit by General Motors Co., NBC
apologized on air. 
In the present case, Goldman staged a CDO to explode. 
Another example: in 1991, a Salomon Brothers trader lied to
the government. Though no investor fraud was involved, the CEO,
John Gutfreund, was forced to resign merely because he had
waited a few months before reporting the incident. The new
interim CEO, Warren Buffett, publicly apologized. He insisted
then that in the future Salomon Brothers would be &#8220;way, way
away from the line.&#8221; He wanted it to steer clear of any
behavior that was even remotely questionable, much less illegal. 
Word From Buffett 
Should Goldman aspire to any less? The same Buffett&#8217;s
Berkshire Hathaway is an investor in Goldman. It would be nice
to hear Buffett endorse his principles with respect to Goldman
now. (Disclosure: I am an investor in Berkshire.) 
Either way, Blankfein should deliver a public apology.
Stonewalling, dissembling or parsing the facts won&#8217;t restore
Goldman&#8217;s name. Goldman may also have to settle with investors
who lost money on this and any similar deals. It will cost
Goldman money but it will be worth it. 
Finally, Goldman needs to look in the mirror and ask how a
firm long known for its stellar reputation and ethics could have
gone so wrong. My own theory is that three steps in the firm&#8217;s
evolution eroded the class that Goldman once stood for. 
Going Public 
First, when the firm was sold, ending its days as a
partnership, in 1999, managers gradually began to think of
Goldman as a public stock rather than their private firm. 
Second, Goldman became more of a trader, less an investment
banker. Bankers think long-term, traders short-term. Last year,
76 percent of its revenue was from trading and for investing for
its own account. 
Finally, the shift toward trading was duplicated in
Goldman&#8217;s upper management, which formerly was divided between
both camps. Since Blankfein took over in 2006, traders have
dominated. 
Goldman, of course, will say it still cares about
reputation. Tell that to IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG. In 2006,
the German bank specifically told Goldman it was no longer
comfortable investing in CDOs that didn&#8217;t &#8220;utilize a collateral
manager, meaning an independent third-party,&#8221; according to the
SEC&#8217;s complaint. Goldman told IKB it had such a manager -- ACA.
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson. IKB lost almost all of its $150
million investment. 
Goldman&#8217;s exploded CDO already may have changed the future
of Wall Street. The case seems certain to speed financial
overhaul legislation through Congress. The question is whether
that CDO will change -- or threaten -- the future of Goldman as
well.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. faces a
regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from the German
government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued the firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called April 17 for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for
details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel
said. 
Politicians who were forced to bail out banks during the
financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. 
&#8220;We will see politicians throughout the world piling on
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Scott Moeller, a former investment banker
now teaching at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;Now they have
vulnerability. Everyone and anyone, especially politicians, are
going to be trying to make hay with this one.&#8221; 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. 
The firm denies any wrongdoing. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs, and Heidi Ashley, a spokeswoman for the FSA,
declined to comment.

New Suits 
Goldman Sachs Sued by SEC for Fraud Tied to CDOs 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by U.S. regulators for
fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations that contributed
to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
firm&#8217;s shares tumbled as much as 16 percent and financial stocks
slumped. 
Goldman Sachs misstated and omitted key facts about a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market was starting to falter, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement April 16. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president. 
&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said in the statement. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a
client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily
influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment
portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities
were selected by an independent, objective third party.&#8221; 
The SEC alleged that Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, structured and marketed CDOs that
hinged on the performance of subprime mortgage-backed
securities. The New York-based firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the selection of securities
for the portfolio, the SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas Van Praag didn&#8217;t return a
call and an e-mail seeking comment. A call to Richard Klapper,
an attorney for Goldman Sachs at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, wasn&#8217;t
returned. Tourre, reached by phone in London April 16, declined
to comment. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at
Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. 
Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for New York-based Paulson 
Co., said he couldn&#8217;t comment. The company oversees $32 billion.

Ex-Blackwater President Indicted on Weapons Charges 
The former president of Blackwater Worldwide Inc., the
military contractor now called Xe Services LLC, was charged with
illegal possession of machine guns and falsifying documents. 
Gary Jackson, 52, and four other former Blackwater
officials were indicted April 16 in federal court in Raleigh,
North Carolina. They are accused of using sheriff department
stationery to buy AK 47s and other guns for Blackwater&#8217;s
training facility to get around restrictions on the number of
fully automatic weapons permitted in their inventory. 
The indictment also charges the five with falsifying
documents to make it appear that weapons Blackwater gave the
king of Jordan and his entourage in 2005, during a visit to the
Moyock, North Carolina, training facility, were purchased by the
defendants. 
They are also accused of putting short barrels on rifles
for use in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Blackwater provided
security services for the U.S., without registering them as such
and obstructing an investigation into the altered weapons. 
Kenneth Bell, a lawyer for Jackson, and Stacy DeLuke, a
spokeswoman for Xe, didn&#8217;t return calls for comment. 
The case is U.S. v. Gary Jackson, 10-8, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of North Carolina (Raleigh.) 
Ex-Credit Agricole Banker Sues on Bonus Exchange Rate 
A former Credit Agricole SA banker responsible for
derivatives is suing over the exchange rate the bank used to
convert his bonus from euros to pounds. 
Peter Ollila, formerly an executive director in sales
covering derivatives and securitized products for Nordic
countries and Poland, is seeking at least $96,000, plus
interest, from the Paris-based bank, according to a London
lawsuit made public this week. 
Ollila, who worked for the bank from Feb. 1, 2008, until
Nov. 21, 2008, said he is owed 33,000 pounds ($51,000) because
Credit Agricole converted his 327,500-euro ($443,000) bonus
using 2007 exchange rates rather than 2008 rates. He is also
seeking a 33,865 euro deferred payment, which he said he never
received. 
&#8220;It was an implied term&#8221; of the contract that Credit
Agricole would determine the exchange rate &#8220;reasonably and in
good faith and that the defendant&#8217;s exercise of its discretion
would not be irrational or perverse,&#8221; Ollila said in the
lawsuit that was originally filed in March. 
A Credit Agricole spokeswoman in Paris didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for comment. 
The case is Peter Ollila v. Credit Agricole Corporate 
Investment Bank, claim no. 2010/893, High Court of Justice,
Queens Bench Division (London).

Miami Beach Hotel Developers Charged With Hiding Funds 
A pair of Miami Beach hotel developers were arrested and
charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service
by hiding more than $45 million in offshore accounts. 
Mauricio Cohen Assor and his son Leon Cohen Levy, who built
residential hotels under the Flatotel name, never told the IRS
about proceeds of the $33 million sale in 2000 of a New York
hotel, according to a complaint in federal court in Miami. Cohen
Assor also used offshore nominee accounts to hide the ownership
of a Swiss account at an international bank that held $45.6
million in 2004, according to the complaint. 
The men were arrested in New York April 15, the deadline
for filing federal tax returns for 2009, as the Justice
Department also charged seven former UBS AG clients with tax
crimes for hiding funds abroad. The developers were detained
after an initial appearance in federal court in Manhattan. 
The two also used bank accounts in the name of their
business, American Leisure Resorts, to fund a &#8220;luxury
lifestyle&#8221; for themselves and family members, according to the
complaint. They paid for &#8220;lavish personal residences, living

DynCorp Sued by Holder Over $1.5 Billion Cerberus Bid 
DynCorp International Inc., the defense contractor that has
helped train Iraqi police, was sued by a stockholder claiming
his shares are undervalued in a $1.5 billion takeover bid by
Cerberus Capital Management LP. 
DynCorp, based in Falls Church, Virginia, said in a
statement on April 12 it would be bought by the New York-based
investment fund for $17.55 a share in cash -- a 49 percent
premium at the time. 
&#8220;The proposed transaction is unfair and grossly
inadequate&#8221; and &#8220;Cerberus may be taking advantage of a
temporarily depressed stock price,&#8221; shareholder Shawn K. Naito
said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed April 16.
Lawyers for Naito ask a judge to stop the deal and award damages
and legal fees. 
Craig R. Reed, a DynCorp senior vice president, didn&#8217;t

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Merrill Used Same Alleged Fraud as Goldman, Bank Says 
Merrill Lynch  Co. engaged in the same investor fraud that
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. of committing, according to a bank that sued
the firm in New York last year. 
Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, known
as Rabobank, claims Merrill, now a unit of Bank of America
Corp., failed to tell it a key fact in advising on a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation. Omitted was Merrill&#8217;s
relationship with another client betting against the investment,
which resulted in a loss of $45 million, Rabobank claims. 
Merrill&#8217;s handling of the CDO, a security tied to the
performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities,
allegedly mirrored Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct that the SEC detailed
in a civil complaint filed April 16. The SEC claims Goldman
omitted the same key fact about a financial product tied to
subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing market was starting to
falter. 
&#8220;This is the tip of the iceberg in regard to Goldman Sachs
and certain other banks who were stacking the deck against CDO
investors,&#8221; said Jon Pickhardt, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart Oliver  Hedges, who is representing Netherlands-based
Rabobank. 
&#8220;The two matters are unrelated and the claims today are
not only unfounded but weren&#8217;t included in the Rabobank lawsuit
filed nearly a year ago,&#8221; Bill Halldin, a Merrill spokesman,
said April 16 of the Dutch bank&#8217;s claims. 
Kenneth Lench, head of the SEC&#8217;s Structured and New
Products unit, said that the agency &#8220;continues to investigate
the practices of investment banks and others involved in the
securitization of complex financial products tied to the U.S.
housing market as it was beginning to show signs of distress.&#8221; 
In its complaint, the SEC said New York-based Goldman
Sachs, which had a record $13.4 billion profit last year, failed
to disclose to investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was
betting against the CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the
selection of securities for the portfolio. Paulson, which
oversees $32 billion and didn&#8217;t market the CDO, wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing by the SEC. 
The SEC allegations are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact, and we
will vigorously contest them,&#8221; Goldman said in a statement. 
SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on whether it
is investigating Merrill&#8217;s actions. 
The case is Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank
BA v. Merrill Lynch  Co, 09-601832, New York State Supreme
Court (New York County).

Rajaratnam Sought Tips on Berkshire&#8217;s Goldman Buys, U.S. Says 
Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam, who faces federal
insider trading charges, sought to acquire secret information
about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s 2008 purchase of preferred
shares in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., federal prosecutors said in
a court filing. 
A letter from federal prosecutors to Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers
detailing new allegations of insider trading was made public
April 16 in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. In it,
prosecutors elaborated on an earlier claim that Rajaratnam tried
to use confidential information to trade on Goldman Sachs stock. 
Rajaratnam &#8220;conspired to obtain material, nonpublic
information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman Sachs&#8221;
before its public announcement of earnings in June 2008 and
December 2008, according to the letter. &#8220;In addition,
Rajaratnam conspired to obtain material, nonpublic information
about the purchase by Berkshire Hathaway of preferred stock in
Goldman prior to Goldman&#8217;s public announcement&#8221; on Sept. 3,
2008, prosecutors said. 
Lawyers for Rajaratnam are asking a judge to exclude
evidence of additional allegations of insider trading, saying
prosecutors waited too long to disclose it. 
The filing doesn&#8217;t identify Rajaratnam&#8217;s source for
information about Goldman Sachs. It does provide details about
other alleged efforts to obtain inside information. 
&#8220;The allegation is false,&#8221; said Jim McCarthy, a spokesman
for Rajaratnam. 
Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is the central figure
in a probe in which 21 people have been charged criminally. He
claimed prosecutors are &#8220;sandbagging the defense&#8221; in violation
of his constitutional rights, including the right to defend
himself at trial. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Bank Class-Actions Bid in U.K. Not Dead, BBA Says 
U.K. consumers are likely to get another chance to file
class-action lawsuits against banks after a clause allowing such
cases was dropped from legislation written to respond to the
financial crisis. 
The provision will probably be taken up by a new government
following the May 6 general election, according to Eric
Leenders, a director at the London-based British Bankers&#8217;
Association, which didn&#8217;t object to the bill. 
&#8220;This isn&#8217;t going away,&#8221; Leenders said in a phone
interview April 16. &#8220;Whichever party comes into power will be
looking at some kind of collective proceedings. We have another
opportunity to think about how they could be constructed.&#8221; 
The Financial Services Bill became law on April 8, after a
clause allowing groups to sue financial services firms was
abandoned when lawmakers ran out of time to debate it before
parliament was dissolved ahead of the election. 
The clause was considered amid increasing complaints about
bank fees, which U.K. antitrust regulators were barred from
examining for fairness. The language would have allowed lead
plaintiffs in a case to file claims on behalf of unspecified
customers who would have then needed to opt out of the case. 
Rachael Mulheron, a Queen Mary University of London law
professor who helped draft court rules for the dropped
provision, also said the class-action law has a chance with the
new government.

Verdicts/Settlements 
U.K. Tobacco Makers and Retailers Fined $346 Million 
 Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Gallaher Group Ltd. and 10
retailers were fined 225 million pounds ($346 million) for
coordinating cigarette prices between 2001 and 2003, a U.K.
antitrust regulator said. 
Imperial, the maker of the West, Davidoff and JPS brands,
received the largest penalty of 112.3 million pounds, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trade said April 16 in a statement. Gallaher, a
unit of Japan Tobacco Inc., was fined 50.4 million pounds. The
fine is the largest of its kind by the regulator. 
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc.&#8217;s Asda unit was fined 14.2 million
pounds and The Co-operative Group was fined 14.1 million pounds
for their roles in a price-fixing scheme that the OFT says
barred retailers from setting their own prices. The affected
markets are worth about 13 billion pounds, the regulator said. 
The OFT said it dropped allegations made in 2008 about the
relationship between the tobacco companies and Tesco Plc,
because it didn&#8217;t have enough evidence. The regulator also said
it abandoned claims relating to indirect exchanges of proposed
future retail prices. 
Imperial denied breaking any laws and said in a statement
it would appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. Japan
Tobacco views the fine as a &#8220;positive&#8221; development since the
fine has been formally decided, spokeswoman Yuka Sugimoto said. 
William Morrison Supermarkets Plc said it would challenge
the fines, saying the OFT&#8217;s stance was &#8220;illogical and without
foundation.&#8221; Morrison was fined 2.45 million pounds and Safeway
stores, which it acquired, were fined 10.9 million pounds. 
 J Sainsbury Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest supermarket
owner, alerted the OFT to the price-fixing arrangement and was
the first to apply to the watchdog for leniency. The company
received full immunity from fines. 
Imperial hasn&#8217;t taken any provisions for the fine, and
&#8220;any appeal to the tribunal will lead to the suspension of the
fine,&#8221; Imperial Tobacco spokesman Simon Evans said April 16 in
a phone interview. 
Gallaher, Asda, First Quench, One Stop, Somerfield and TM
Retail were given reductions to their fines because they
admitted liability when they received the OFT&#8217;s so-called
statement of objections in April 2008.

Dewey  LeBoeuf Issues Bonds as Law Firms Search for Capital 
Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP said it raised money in a bond
offering, a rare action by a U.S. law firm. The New York-based
firm sold about $125 million in an offering, according to two
people familiar with the transaction. 
The 1,200-attorney firm used the private placement to
refinance existing bank debt, partner Richard Shutran said. He
declined to disclose the interest rate for the bonds, saying it
was more favorable than the firm&#8217;s bank loans.

Court News 
Oboe-Playing Judicial Artist Diane Wood Eyed for High Court 
Diane Wood and her colleagues on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago have philosophical differences. That
didn&#8217;t stop Judge Richard Posner, the court&#8217;s most outspoken
conservative, from officiating at her wedding when she married
for the third time in 2006. 
Wood has demonstrated a willingness to challenge her fellow
jurists without offending, say lawyers and clerks who have
observed her in court. Those attributes may be an asset as
President Barack Obama considers her to replace retiring Justice
John Paul Stevens on an often-divided U.S. Supreme Court. 
In 1995, Wood persuaded Posner and other jurists to rethink
the case of an Indiana inmate fighting his death sentence when
she asked whether anyone warned him about repeated federal
challenges. &#8220;Silence can mislead,&#8221; Posner later wrote,
reversing an earlier opinion joined by fellow judge Frank
Easterbrook. 
&#8220;That was an example of the art of judging,&#8221; said Tom
Brown, a former clerk for Wood who is a San Francisco lawyer.
&#8220;She asked the question in a way not to embarrass Judge
Easterbrook.&#8221; 
While Wood&#8217;s opinions supported abortion rights and
separation of church and state, her rulings on business matters
aren&#8217;t easy to pigeonhole. 
A 2000 decision favored Ameritech Corp. in a lawsuit filed
by consumers. Just days later, she upheld a Federal Trade
Commission finding that Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us Inc. improperly tried to use
its market power to keep the most popular toys out of warehouse-
style discount stores. 
&#8220;She may lean toward the liberal side on social issues,&#8221;
said Jeffrey Sarles, a partner at Chicago-based Mayer Brown LLP
who appeared before Wood on her first day on the bench. &#8220;On
business issues, she doesn&#8217;t seem ideological.&#8221; 
Wood, 59, who plays oboe in the Chicago Bar Association
Symphony Orchestra, said through her staff that she isn&#8217;t
commenting on her reported candidacy.

Court Filings 
Tribune Bankruptcy Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg System 
The bankruptcy docket of the Tribune Co. was the most-read
litigation docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. 
Tribune filed bankruptcy in December 2008, one year after
real estate billionaire Sam Zell used more than $8 billion in
loans to take control of the publishing and television company.
The company&#8217;s newspapers include the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. 
Last week, Tribune filed a reorganization plan that would
reduce debt taken on during a 2007 buyout in exchange for giving
its lenders 91 percent of the bankrupt publisher. The plan,
filed April 12, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, reflects
the settlement Tribune reached with its main creditors. 
To read more about the reorganization plan, click here. 
The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s stock
may drop and the board could come under pressure to change
managers after European politicians followed a U.S. fraud suit
with their own plans to scrutinize the firm, investors said. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the U.K.
Financial Services Authority to start a probe, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Goldman Sachs.
Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details
on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. 
The escalating rhetoric adds urgency to efforts by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of his
board to stem the negative publicity. Although Goldman Sachs
vowed to fight the SEC case, calling it &#8220;unfounded in law and
fact,&#8221; the stock fell 13 percent on April 16. The shares rose
0.6 percent to $162.42 in European trading today. 
&#8220;The lynch-mob mentality that is prevailing right now
against Goldman is such that you don&#8217;t know where this thing
could go, so I think the stock is going to be under continuing
pressure,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4
billion as chairman of New York-based Holland  Co. &#8220;The board
actually has to pay attention not only to the legal niceties of
this thing but also to the franchise viability as well.&#8221; 
Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, said he sold his Goldman Sachs
stock on April 16 because the SEC suit brought the controversy
over Wall Street&#8217;s dealings in collateralized debt obligations
and credit-default swaps to a new level. 
&#8216;Investors Understand Fraud&#8217; 
&#8220;Investors understand that something complicated and
errant happened with CDOs and CDSs but they&#8217;re not sure entirely
what, because these collateralized debt obligations and credit-
default swaps are complicated and somewhat arcane,&#8221; said Farr,
whose firm manages more than $700 million in assets. &#8220;But
investors understand fraud, they get fraud really clearly.&#8221;
Samuel Robinson, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. 
Goldman Sachs, whose $13.4 billion profit last year was the
highest ever for a Wall Street securities firm, is facing an
unprecedented level of public opprobrium because of the
perception that it profited from practices that led to the
biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at the Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as
other financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously
very worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it
could well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; 
&#8216;The Bogey Man&#8217; 
Politicians that were forced to bail out their nations&#8217;
banks are turning on Goldman Sachs. The firm, which paid its
employees $16.2 billion last year, has become a target for
politicians like the U.K.&#8217;s Brown who are running in elections
or who, in the U.S., are battling over new financial regulation. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs will now become the bogey man for all
financial ills and I think it&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s not going away,
it is only likely to increase,&#8221; said Matt McCormick, an analyst
at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8
billion. &#8220;If you buy it at these levels you are hoping that
this is the worst of the bad news and I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the
case.&#8221; 
The European Union is probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role in
arranging swaps for Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s
budget deficit. Congress has also examined the company&#8217;s
relationship with American International Group Inc., which got a
$182.3 billion U.S. rescue. 
Federal Case Assigned 
The SEC case against Goldman Sachs was assigned to U.S.
District Judge Barbara Jones in New York who presided over the
case of former WorldCom Inc. CEO Bernard Ebbers. Ebbers, who was
convicted in 2005 of overseeing one of the biggest frauds in
U.S. history, is serving a 25-year prison term. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter profit, due out tomorrow,
probably won&#8217;t help even though analysts expect earnings to rise
41 percent from a year earlier, McCormick said. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to probably come out with great earnings,
at least that&#8217;s the expectation, but that is going to be quickly
discounted and drowned out,&#8221; he said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board of directors should do its own
investigation to ensure that it understands what senior
management knew about the issues raised by the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
said James Post, a professor of corporate governance and ethics
at the Boston University School of Management. 
&#8216;How Long?&#8217; 
&#8220;The board has got to be insisting on a much deeper level
of internal investigation that reports only to them, not to
Blankfein,&#8221; Post. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got to be asking the question &#8216;how
long can we continue going with Blankfein before we&#8217;ve got to
clean house and put a new group of people in there?&#8221; 
William W. George, a Harvard Business School professor who
has served on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board since 2002, referred a
request for an interview to the company&#8217;s press office. His
Twitter account, which lauded JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie
Dimon for his firm&#8217;s better-than-expected earnings on April 14,
remained silent on the controversy surrounding Goldman Sachs. 
Boston University&#8217;s Post said he wouldn&#8217;t expect the board
to take any immediate action to change the firm&#8217;s management
because it would seem to contradict the defiant position the
company took on April 16. 
&#8216;A Bad Weekend&#8217; 
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure that the board at Goldman is having a bad
weekend,&#8221; Post said on April 18. &#8220;They may be praying for some
news out of the Vatican or a new volcano to get them off the
front pages.&#8221; 
Bahl  Gaynor&#8217;s McCormick said changing senior management
could add fuel to critics&#8217; complaints instead of mollifying
them. A better course, he said, would be to bring in a well-
respected Wall Street veteran, even someone like billionaire
Warren Buffett, to serve as a chairman or adviser to Blankfein.
Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is already one of the largest
investors in Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;I could see them bringing in an outside person, somebody
who is viewed by the Street as a wise sage that could come in
and give an outsider&#8217;s perspective&#8221; to advise Blankfein,
McCormick said. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to believe Goldman is going to
take care of this on their own.&#8221;

Widening probes of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may prompt a drop of as much as 10 percent in global
stock markets, according to AMP Capital Investors Ltd., a unit
of Australia&#8217;s biggest provider of pension plans. 
The MSCI World Index, as well as U.S. and Asian equity
gauges, are ripe for a &#8220;multi-month&#8221; correction after
valuations soared, said Nader Naeimi, a strategist who helps
oversee $90 billion for the Sydney-based mutual-funds manager.
AMP Capital last week began moving to cash assets from equities,
anticipating a decline in stocks, Naeimi said. The MSCI World,
which measures 23 developed markets, has rallied 43 percent in
the past 12 months. 
&#8220;The Goldman inquiries have triggered a fresh wave of
anxiety for investors,&#8221; Naeimi said in an interview today.
&#8220;Not only is the market worried who might be next, it&#8217;s
anticipating tighter regulation of the banking sector. Given how
over-bought stocks had become, this may be enough to trigger the
sharp correction in the overall market that we&#8217;ve been
expecting.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most-profitable Wall Street firm in
history, faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from
the German government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued the firm for alleged fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. 
Financial Stocks 
The MSCI World Index&#8217;s rally in the past 12 months has
driven the average valuation for companies in the gauge to 14.8
times estimated earnings, compared with 11.2 times at the
gauge&#8217;s March 9, 2009 low. The measure dropped 0.6 percent as
of 4:57 p.m. in Tokyo, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank
1.9 percent. 
Any correction is likely to hurt financial stocks in
particular, and could last for as long as six months, at which
point shares in Asian banks, which are generally less leveraged
than their U.S. and European counterparts, will look especially
attractive, AMP Capital&#8217;s Naeimi said. 
&#8220;Whenever the global financial sector is hit, there tends
to be guilt by association,&#8221; said Naeimi. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at
buying into Asian financials when we think the correction is
close to having run its course. Depending on relative valuations
at the time, you might well see us rotating out of developed-
world financial stocks into Asian ones.&#8221; 
U.K. Probe 
The strategist told a Bloomberg Television on April 14,
2009 that the &#8220;bear market&#8221; in global equities had ended. The
MSCI World Index finished the year with a 27 percent advance.
Naeimi also called a &#8220;correction&#8221; for the U.S. Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index on Oct. 16, 2009. The gauge dropped 5.6 percent
between Oct. 19 and Oct. 30. 
U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry into Goldman,
saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated
in the suit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC
for details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela
Merkel said. 
Politicians who were forced to bail out their banks during
the financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. 
&#8220;The timing of the accusations against Goldman was perfect
for investors seeking to sell shares, since markets worldwide
had been overheating,&#8221; said Kiyoshi Ishigane, a strategist in
Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $66 billion.

A fraud suit by U.S. regulators
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is unlikely to send hedge funds
scrambling to reduce gold holdings, according to Superfund
Financial Singapore Pte. 
Any retreat in prices will present investors, especially
central banks, with a buying opportunity, Aaron Smith, managing
director of Superfund, said in an interview today. Gold for
immediate delivery was little changed at $1,136.57 an ounce at
11:57 a.m. in Singapore after slumping by the most in more than
two months on April 16. 
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t expect hedge funds to unwind their
positions,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Even if they do, I think central
banks, especially in the East, whether it&#8217;s India or China or
any central bank that is smart, will use it as an opportunity to
acquire gold at a cheaper level.&#8221; 
Goldman faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny
from the German government after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. The firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
instruments and influenced the selections in the portfolio, the
SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. 
As of Dec. 31, Paulson was the largest holder in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund back by the metal,
and Goldman was the 11th biggest. Both are based in New York.
Paulson is also the top investor in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.,
Africa&#8217;s largest producer of bullion. 
&#8216;Good Opportunity&#8217; 
Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions in New York gold futures in the week
ended April 13, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. 
Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 220,742 contracts on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Washington-
based commission said in its Commitments of Traders report. Net-
long positions rose by 17,296 contracts, or 9 percent, from a
week earlier. 
&#8220;In the short term, there&#8217;s a possibility of a pullback
and we would recommend to any investor that&#8217;s a good
opportunity&#8221; to enter the market, Smith said. &#8220;In the long run,
the hard assets will have sustainable value and sustainable
purchasing power.&#8221; 
Gold rallied 24 percent last year as central banks and
governments maintained low interest rates and spent trillions of
dollars to stimulate economies, sending the dollar 4.2 percent
lower against six major currencies. Bullion has gained 3.6
percent this year. 
&#8220;If the upward trend in equity markets continues and
interest rates continue to stay low, we won&#8217;t certainly see a
large pullback in commodity markets,&#8221; Smith said. 
Central banks in Russia, China, India, Sri Lanka and
Mauritius have all increased their gold reserves. China has
expanded reserves by 76 percent to 1,054 metric tons since 2003,
the central bank said last year. India bought 200 tons from the
International Monetary Fund last year as gold prices soared and
the dollar weakened.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accused
by regulators last week of fraud in its mortgage-securities
business, may show investors tomorrow whether its dominance of
Wall Street&#8217;s debt trading is being eroded by competitors. 
Analysts including Howard Chen at Credit Suisse Group AG
expect New York-based Goldman Sachs, which reports first-quarter
earnings tomorrow, to say revenue from fixed-income trading
dropped from $6.56 billion in last year&#8217;s first quarter.
Earnings last week from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co., the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, surged on record
first-quarter revenue from the business. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, relied on fixed-income trading for more than
half of revenue last year, helping the firm post record profit.
Competitors that lagged behind Goldman Sachs a year ago are
trying to catch up. Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on
April 21, hired more than 350 people last year to rebuild its
sales and trading business. 
&#8220;Competition appears to be returning, but it&#8217;s not
necessarily a zero-sum game as the overall market is growing,&#8221;
said New York-based Chen, who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &#8220;Global GDP is positive,
fixed-income issuance levels have been robust and client
liquidity levels seem healthy.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s competitors may see the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit against the firm as an opportunity to
grab market share. The SEC sued the firm for fraud on April 16,
saying Goldman Sachs misled investors in its marketing of
collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages.
Goldman Sachs said the allegations were &#8220;completely unfounded in
law and fact.&#8221; 
Dimon&#8217;s Outlook 
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts last week that he
didn&#8217;t expect his bank to be alone in reporting gains in trading
revenue because overall demand from clients has picked up. 
&#8220;It is a lot of client flow, so we&#8217;re not the only ones
who saw that,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to see other
people report similarly good numbers driven by client flow.&#8221; 
Of the six-biggest U.S. banks by assets, only Goldman Sachs
and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. are expected by
analysts to show a decline in profit in 2010 compared with last
year, when they both generated record earnings. 
First-quarter adjusted earnings at Goldman Sachs will
probably rise 54 percent from a year earlier to $2.55 billion,
or $4.14 per share, according to the average estimate of 23
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Gorman&#8217;s Goal 
James Gorman, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s new CEO, is expected to
report $1.1 billion in adjusted first-quarter earnings, or 57
cents a share, compared with a loss a year earlier, a Bloomberg
survey shows. Credit Suisse&#8217;s Chen expects Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
fixed-income trading revenue to rise to $1.95 billion from last
year&#8217;s $1.29 billion, which was damped by writedowns and
accounting adjustments related to the firm&#8217;s credit costs. 
&#8220;You listen to James Gorman on the call last quarter and
he&#8217;s very clear that we want to be top three in all of our
businesses,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;That would mean closing the gap in
fixed-income and equities trading.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment
about trading revenue. Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag
also declined to comment. 
Goldman Sachs gained 4.7 percentage points of market share
in fixed-income trading since the first half of 2007, more than
double the next-biggest climb of any of the top 14 banks, Keith
Horowitz, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an April 6 note
to investors. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s market share in fixed-income
trading fell 2.4 percentage points in that time, Horowitz said. 
&#8220;Ability to regain trading market share is the key to the
stock,&#8221; Horowitz wrote of Morgan Stanley. 
Analysts&#8217; Estimates 
Goldman Sachs will probably report $6.09 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue in the first quarter, down 7 percent from
a year earlier, Barclays Capital analyst Roger Freeman said in a
March 30 note. Morgan Stanley may report $1.94 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue, up 50 percent, Freeman said. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s first-quarter earnings surpassed estimates last
week in part because of $5.5 billion in fixed-income revenue
that set a record for the New York-based bank. Bank of America
said April 16 that revenue from fixed-income, currency and
commodity trading climbed 16 percent to $5.52 billion in the
first quarter, the most since the largest U.S. bank acquired
Merrill Lynch last year. 
UBS AG generated about $2.3 billion of revenue at its
fixed-income division in the first quarter, people with
knowledge of the situation said last month. The bank said that
figure was &#8220;slightly higher&#8221; than its forecast. Writedowns in
the first quarter of 2009 forced the Zurich-based company to
report negative revenue of 1.97 billion Swiss francs ($1.86
billion) for the period. 
&#8216;Normal Level&#8217; 
&#8220;Revenues you&#8217;re seeing now are probably more broadly
based,&#8221; said Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic
Equities LLP. &#8220;Bid-offer spreads have come down to a more normal
level, but you&#8217;ve seen a pickup in client activity across a
number of different sectors, so I think we&#8217;re getting more
toward a normal environment.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs generated $23.3 billion in revenue from sales
and trading in fixed-income, currencies and commodities, more
than half of the firm&#8217;s total revenue last year. That
performance helped drive the firm to the largest profit in Wall
Street history just one year after reporting its first quarterly
loss as a public company. 
Morgan Stanley generated $5.02 billion of fixed-income
sales and trading revenue as it ramped up risk at a slower pace
than Goldman. The firm replaced its sales and trading chief,
Mitch Petrick, and its head of interest-rate trading, Roberto
Hoornweg, and has been hiring to revive the business. 
Debt Spreads 
Charges related to the firm&#8217;s debt spreads that reduced
fixed-income trading revenue by $3.3 billion in 2009 &#8220;are
largely behind&#8221; it, Gorman said this month in a letter to
shareholders. 
Still, 12 analysts have cut their estimate for Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s first-quarter earnings in the past four weeks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average adjusted
earnings per-share estimate fell 13.8 cents in that period, the
data show. 
&#8220;Morgan Stanley is trying to become more diversified by
expanding its retail brokerage, but trading revenues remain the
key factor driving their results,&#8221; Staite said. 
Goldman Sachs shares have dropped 4.8 percent this year,
including a 13 percent decline on April 16 when the fraud
allegations were announced. Morgan Stanley has dropped 1.5
percent in 2010, after gaining gained 85 percent last year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
U.S. fraud case against the firm hinges on the actions of the
employee it placed on paid leave this week. 
Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about a
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will also be de-registered
from the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm
in London said yesterday. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; 
By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publically distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. 
Goldman Sachs may also want to separate itself from Tourre
if it&#8217;s concerned he will cooperate with the SEC or implicate
more senior employees, said Onnig Dombalagian, a professor at
Tulane University Law School in New Orleans and former attorney
fellow at the SEC.

Bank shares in countries such as
China and India, which have outperformed global rivals by about
30 percentage points since the &#8220;Lehman shock,&#8221; may extend
their advantage amid fraud probes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
The CHART OF THE DAY shows MSCI&#8217;s financials indexes for
emerging-markets in Asia and worldwide starting from Sept. 15,
2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
The bottom panel compares the gauges&#8217; weighted estimated
earnings, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman was sued
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16.
Asia&#8217;s emerging markets as defined by Morgan Stanley for its
indexes include China, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam. 
&#8220;Asian emerging-market financial stocks will continue to
outperform,&#8221; said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of multi-asset
strategy at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees
$11 billion. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot less volcanic eruption in Asian
financials compared with Western financials, which face
increasing regulation and sovereign-debt issues.&#8221; 
The financial crisis in 1997 caused Asian banks to be
&#8220;more prudent,&#8221; allowing them to strengthen balance sheets,
said Do. That crisis, triggered by plunging currencies, forced
Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea to seek International
Monetary Fund aid. Asia&#8217;s emerging-market countries have about
$3.7 trillion in reserves, almost half the global total. 
&#8220;Asian banks in general have more healthy balance sheets,
and their loan growth so far has been recovering quite well
versus still-negative loan growth in U.S. and European banks,&#8221;
said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based vice president of investment
services at JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., which manages about
$102 billion in Asia-Pacific assets. 
The SEC suit against Goldman linked to collateralized debt
obligations may also trigger stricter scrutiny from European
regulators. The U.K. Financial Services Authority said it will
investigate Goldman Sachs International. The European Union is
also probing the bank&#8217;s role in arranging credit swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit.

U.S. Senate candidate Alexi
Giannoulias pushed his Republican opponent in Illinois to give
back donations from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. without saying
whether President Barack Obama should return almost $1 million
that bank employees contributed to his White House bid. 
Obama, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Mark Kirk, the congressman competing against Giannoulias
for the seat once held by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from
Goldman employees, the center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are
Democratic Congressman Michael McMahon of New York, Republican
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, and three other New York
Democrats: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Representative Scott
Murphy and Senator Charles Schumer. 
&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail
against the needed reforms the administration is advocating,&#8221;
Hari Sevugan, Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement.

Allegations that Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. deceived its customers have done little to hurt Wall
Street&#8217;s stock recommendation, the most bullish since 2005. 
Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. reiterated &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-based
company since April 16, when the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a fraud suit that has sent the shares down 11
percent. Twenty-two firms advise that clients purchase Goldman
Sachs, which today reported first-quarter profit excluding some
items that beat the average analyst estimate by 35 percent. One,
Oppenheimer  Co., downgraded the stock since the claims were
announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Analysts are speculating Goldman Sachs will preserve its
reputation and benefit from an expanding economy that helped
lift its shares 208 percent since November 2008. The stock
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday after two people with knowledge of
the vote said the SEC split 3-2 along party lines to approve the
enforcement action, before falling 2.1 percent today. 
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sell any,&#8221; said Stephen Lieber, chief
investment officer of Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC, which
manages more than $7 billion, including Goldman Sachs shares,
from Purchase, New York. &#8220;Do we have sufficient information to
provide an overall take at this point? No. The underlying
business of Goldman Sachs remains a suitable investment.&#8221;

Illinois, New Jersey and Texas are
among municipal-bond issuers sticking with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to underwrite pending debt sales after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission charged the firm with fraud. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re innocent until proven guilty,&#8221; said James Fuller,
chief financial officer of Georgia&#8217;s Municipal Electric
Authority in Atlanta, which borrowed $2.5 billion in early March
using banks led by Goldman. &#8220;People have to have their day in
court.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs was the fifth-largest senior underwriter of
municipal debt last year, handling about $34 billion, according
to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. It was accused by the SEC
on April 16 of creating and selling collateralized debt
obligations tied to subprime mortgages in 2007 without
disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities. It also didn&#8217;t say that Paulson bet
against the securities, the SEC said. 
Goldman will remain a co-senior manager on an $851 million
fixed-rate issue for New Jersey&#8217;s Economic Development Authority
scheduled for as soon as this week, said Andrew Pratt, a
spokesman in Trenton, New Jersey, for Treasurer Andrew Eristoff,
a Republican. Goldman is co-senior manager with New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch  Co. will manage the sale. 
&#8220;Until it actually is fined or loses its lawsuit, it would
be very, very premature to eliminate them from a bond
transaction,&#8221; Pratt said in a telephone interview. 
Illinois Sale Coming 
Illinois plans to keep Goldman as an underwriter for coming
bond sales, John Sinsheimer, director of capital markets, said
in an interview from Chicago. So will the North Texas Tollway
Authority on a deal coming in May, Sherita Coffelt, a
spokeswoman based in Plano, Texas, said in an e-mail. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. The firm said in
a statement that the SEC&#8217;s allegations were &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs today reiterated its denial that it misled
investors and reported that net income rose 91 percent in the
first quarter to $3.46 billion, beating analyst estimates. The
shares slid $3.34, or 2.1 percent, to $159.98 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have declined 5.2
percent since Dec. 31. 
Georgia&#8217;s Fuller was among officials saying they would take
a closer look at Goldman Sachs if it were to lose the SEC case
or be found to have committed wrongdoing. 
&#8216;Unacceptable&#8217; 
If the allegations &#8220;are substantiated, they&#8217;re
unacceptable,&#8221; and could prompt the state to review its
relationship with the firm, said Washington State Treasurer
James McIntire. Goldman was lead underwriter on $503.4 million
of Build America Bonds for the state in October. 
&#8220;We have concerns about the lawsuit,&#8221; McIntire, a
Democrat, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Transparency is an
important issue. It affects the whole marketplace. We expect our
underwriter to be a partner, not an adversary.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, has made $55.7 million of fees from $36.4
billion of Build America Bonds sales, about a third of what it
earned from its municipal business, the company said in a March
1 response to queries from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an
Iowa Republican. 
Connecticut Review 
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
office has begun a preliminary review for a possible state
investigation of Goldman related to the SEC&#8217;s action. 
&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s allegations read like a Sopranos episode,&#8221;
Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in an April 16 statement, referring
to a crime family at the center of a U.S. television series. 
California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, a Democrat, is also
looking into whether Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street
underwriters promoted derivative trades to clients that would
have enabled them to bet against the state. The state is
reviewing the responses to questions sent to the firm last
month, said spokesman Tom Dresslar, based in Sacramento. He
declined say what steps California may take. 
&#8220;We have questions about how Goldman Sachs and other big
banks have been treating their clients -- the taxpayers of the
state of California,&#8221; said Dresslar. &#8220;The basic question is:
The taxpayers of this state are paying you guys hundreds of
millions of dollars to sell their bonds; to what extent are you
either betting against those bonds or facilitating bets against
those bonds?&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp. fell the most since February in New York trading after
reporting a drop in service signings, signaling corporate
spending on larger technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
total sales, fell about 2 percent to $12.3 billion in the first
quarter, IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
said yesterday. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. 
IBM still hasn&#8217;t signaled to shareholders that profit can
rise based on sales growth rather than steps like costs cutting
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. Investors are seeking faster
revenue growth as the economy begins to recover, he said. 
&#8220;IBM is simply not that attractive of a growth story right
now,&#8221; said Marshall, who rates the shares &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own them. &#8220;Really good financial management from an
earnings perspective. At the end of the day, not much from a
revenue perspective.&#8221; 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said in
its earnings statement. 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $2.54, or 1.9 percent,
to $129.69 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, its steepest drop since Feb. 4. It is little changed
this year, compared with an 8.3 percent advance in the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Corporate Spending 
Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler,
who recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; 
Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. 
IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
risen 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. 
Second-Quarter Outlook 
Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. 
IBM said profit this year will be at least $11.20 a share,
up from a previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts
predicted $11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, spent the past decade
selling off hardware businesses and investing in its higher-
margin software and services units, which now make up more than
80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross profit
margins, the percentage of sales left after production costs,
for 10 quarters on a year-over-year basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported that net income
almost doubled in the first quarter and said it didn&#8217;t mislead
investors. 
&#8220;This all seems to be at root about whether someone
intentionally misled someone, and that&#8217;s not something we would
approve of or sanction,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Co-General Counsel Greg
Palm told analysts on a conference call today. He spoke after
the firm said earnings jumped 91 percent to $3.46 billion, or
$5.59 a share, surpassing analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, is fending off regulatory claims while cementing its
position as the most profitable investment bank in Wall Street
history. The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the firm
of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, helped select the underlying assets. 
Goldman Sachs had &#8220;no incentive&#8221; for the deal to fail,
and lost more than $100 million on the transaction, Palm said.
The firm was &#8220;somewhat surprised&#8221; when the SEC filed its suit
on April 16, as &#8220;no one had told us in advance,&#8221; he said. 
Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the suit today,
saying in a statement announcing earnings that &#8220;in light of
recent events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of
our clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment
of our people.&#8221;

Pfizer Inc. failed to ensure proper
monitoring of patients and their side effects in a clinical
trial, U.S. regulators said today. 
The Food and Drug Administration posted a warning letter on
its Web site today outlining &#8220;significant violations&#8221;
discovered during an inspection of a Pfizer clinical trial site
from May 4 to June 3. The letter, dated April 9, was redacted to
remove the name of the medicine and the study. Pfizer
spokeswoman Kristen Neese said the study involved tests of the
company&#8217;s bipolar disorder treatment Geodon for use in children. 
While Pfizer was warned by the agency in 2005 over lack of
study monitoring that led to widespread overdoses, follow-up
inspections in 2006 and 2007 also found dosing errors, the FDA
said in the documents. The agency ordered the New York-based
drugmaker to respond within 15 days with a plan to ensure that
its studies comply with federal regulations. 
&#8220;Pfizer has communicated with the FDA about our conduct of
clinical trials and, over the next two weeks, will provide an
outline of new and existing processes for preventing similar
issues with Pfizer clinical trials in the future,&#8221; Neese said
in an e-mail today. 
Pfizer fell 3 cents to $16.76 at 4:05 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 7.9
percent this year. 
Geodon&#8217;s Heart Impact 
Geodon prolongs the heart&#8217;s electrical cycle. Short-term
studies suggest children are sensitive to these changes in the
heart and may be more susceptible to potentially deadly
arrhythmias, according to an FDA staff review. Outside advisers
to the agency backed pediatric use in June, with most members
calling for more testing to evaluate the risks. 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&#8217;s Abilify and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s
Risperdal, now generic, were cleared for pediatric use in 2007.
Doctors treating children sometimes prescribe other
antipsychotics that aren&#8217;t approved for pediatric use. 
Children ages 7 to 17 accounted for 11 percent of Geodon
use in 2008, according to data posted on the FDA&#8217;s Web site
before the advisory panel meeting. While doctors are free to
prescribe the drug for this unapproved use, Pfizer isn&#8217;t
permitted by the FDA to promote the medicine to treat children. 
Geodon is approved for adults with schizophrenia and manic
episodes of bipolar disorder.

Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent,
bolstered by sales in Latin America. 
Net income increased to $1.61 billion, or 69 cents share,
in the quarter ended April 2 from $1.35 billion, or 58 cents, a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. 
Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.53 billion, the company said.
Eight analysts predicted $7.72 billion, on average. Global sales
by drink volume grew 3 percent, helped by a 4 percent increase
in Latin America. Sales by drink volume in North America
declined 2 percent. 
Coca-Cola is seeking to boost revenue and volume as
consumers recover from a global recession. Sales have bounced
back faster in emerging markets than in larger markets including
the U.S., Coca-Cola said.

Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 8.3 percent. PepsiCo plans to announce
first-quarter earnings April 22. 
Earnings excluding some items totaled 80 cents a share,
Coca-Cola said. Analysts predicted 74 cents, the average of 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
The company also named Steve Cahillane, president of Coca-
Cola Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s North America unit, to run a new
bottling and foodservice division when it combines with Coca-

Cahillane, who joined Coca-Cola Enterprises in 2007, will
become president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola

Coca-Cola expects to complete the purchase of CCE in the

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
is among at least three companies being investigated as part of
a U.S. Justice Department antitrust probe of bidding at
municipal tax-lien auctions in New Jersey. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Xspand unit and Vienna, Virginia-based Mooring
Tax Asset Group received grand jury subpoenas last year,
according to an August prospectus for New York City tax-lien
bonds that are serviced by the firms. Two units of Royal Bank
America were subpoenaed, its parent, Royal Bancshares of
Pennsylvania Inc. said in a March 2009 regulatory filing. 
New Jersey municipalities auction about $100 million a year
in tax debts on commercial and residential property to
investors, said Vincent Belluscio, executive director of the
state tax collectors and treasurers association. Antitrust
officials are probing whether investors colluded to limit
competition on sales to win a higher return, he said. In New
Jersey, the liens can carry annual interest of as much as 18
percent. The auctions are designed so that investors bid down
the interest rate they&#8217;re willing to accept. 
&#8220;The problem is these investors have a tendency to meet in
the hallway before a sale and divvy up the list,&#8221; Belluscio
said. &#8220;They say, &#8216;We&#8217;ll buy these properties, and you buy
those.&#8217; And the interest rate holds at 18 percent.&#8221; 
Belluscio said his information comes from a tax collector
who was visited by a federal investigator. 
Lien Buyers 
Cities and towns in New Jersey and 27 other states sell tax
debts to investors to raise cash and help plug budget deficits.
Some of the debts are packaged into bonds and sold. Tax-lien
buyers also get the right to collect penalties imposed on
delinquent taxpayers by governments, and have first priority to
take possession of properties when the owners don&#8217;t pay their
taxes. 
About $5 billion of property-tax delinquencies are sold
each year, Xspand officials told the Unified Government
Commission of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas,
according to a transcript of the Nov. 25 meeting on the
municipality&#8217;s Web site. 
In Florida, $1.8 billion of the liens were sold last year,
making it the largest property-debt auction market in the U.S.,
according to Plantation, Florida-based RealAuction.com, which
conducts online tax sales in counties throughout the state. 
Expensive Cost 
&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s concerned,&#8221; said Adam D. Greenberg, managing
partner of law firm Honig  Greenberg in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, whose clients include tax-lien investors. &#8220;Even if
you&#8217;re innocent, just responding to an investigation is
expensive.&#8221; 
Greenberg said he knows of other investors who received
subpoenas, though he declined to identify them or say if they
are clients. 
Justin G. Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment, as did Mark Sanders, a spokesman for Narbeth,
Pennsylvania-based Royal Bank, whose Crusader Servicing Corp.
and Royal Tax Lien Services LLC units are subjects of the probe. 
&#8220;Anybody who is a significant buyer in New Jersey has been
subpoenaed,&#8221; said John M. Jacquemin, president and founder of
Mooring Financial Corp., which has managed and serviced more
than $1 billion in delinquent tax liens since starting Mooring
Tax Asset Group in 1997. &#8220;We certainly were not involved with
any collusion.&#8221; 
Training to Prevent 
Mooring for at least eight years has trained its bidders on
the company policy against anti-competitive behavior and
requires them to sign statements confirming that they understand
the expectations, he said. 
Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington, declined to comment. 
Xspand, which was founded by former New Jersey Governor
James Florio in 2000, was acquired by Bear Stearns Cos. six
years later. Also known as Plymouth Park Tax Services, it became
part of JPMorgan when the New York-based bank took over Bear
Stearns in 2008 to prevent a collapse. 
Xspand, based in Whippany, New Jersey, effectively stopped
participating in open-outcry auctions about nine months ago, a
person familiar with the decision said. It had become the
largest tax-lien investor in the U.S., buying $2 billion of
public debt across the country since 2008, The New York Times
reported Aug. 18. 
The company continues to service tax liens and bid on them
in Internet auctions and bulk sales by municipalities, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because of the
investigation. 
Florio Unaware 
Florio, who sold his Xspand interest in 2006, said he
wasn&#8217;t aware of the Justice Department investigation. Tax-lien
sales were heated when he ran the company, he said in an April
16 telephone interview. 
&#8220;It was very, very competitive,&#8221; he said. 
Paul V. Scura, who founded Xspand with Florio and left when
Bear Stearns took it over, said Xspand employees got thorough
training on avoiding anticompetitive behavior. 
&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine any of the employees of Xspand doing that
given how they&#8217;ve been sensitized to the importance of this
issue,&#8221; Scura said in an April 19 telephone interview. 
Last June, Harvey M. Nusbaum and Jack W. Stollof were
indicted in federal court in Maryland for conspiring to rig tax-
lien bids at auctions in the state. Nusbaum and Stollof and
others &#8220;agreed among themselves which of them would bid on
specific tax liens or groups of tax liens, and agreed upon
specific prices to be bid in certain auctions,&#8221; according to a
June 16 statement by the Justice Department. 
Plea Agreement 
Nusbaum entered a plea agreement and Stollof pleaded guilty
early this year. 
&#8220;With so many homeowners struggling these days, it is more
important than ever that all aspects of real estate
transactions, including tax-lien auctions, remain competitive
and free from collusion,&#8221; Scott D. Hammond, deputy assistant
U.S. attorney general for criminal enforcement of the
department&#8217;s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement
last June.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is
facing a fraud suit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over its sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
tried to get rid of its portion of the deal, a lawyer for the
firm said. 
&#8220;I believe we did attempt to see if there was any other
interest on the other side of the transaction,&#8221; Greg Palm,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said today on a conference
call with reporters when asked if the New York-based firm had
tried to sell its stake in the &#8220;super-senior&#8221; debt. 
Goldman Sachs said it lost more than $100 million on the
Abacus 2007-AC1 collateralized debt obligation that is at the
center of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit, including $83 million related to
its piece of the super-senior debt. The regulator says the firm
failed to explain to buyers of the CDO that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., which planned to bet on the CDO failing, had helped select
the assets underlying the security. 
Earlier today, on a conference call with analysts, Palm
said the company&#8217;s decision to own some of the CDO showed it had
confidence in the deal. 
&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have taken on this risk if we believed there
was something wrong in this transaction, we wouldn&#8217;t have put
our skin in the game in that way,&#8221; Palm said. 
Also on today&#8217;s call with reporters, Palm said the firm and
its representatives haven&#8217;t had discussions with the Department
of Justice on the case involved in the SEC matter or on any
similar issues. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had no discussions with the DOJ,&#8221; Palm said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., being
sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims
that it deceived investors about one of its financial products,
tried to fend off regulators last fall by arguing it had a duty
to keep the information confidential. 
The company failed to disclose that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., run by billionaire John Paulson, helped pick the underlying
securities in a collateralized debt obligation and then bet
against them, the SEC said in a lawsuit filed April 16. After
being told in July 2009 that the SEC planned to bring a
complaint, New York-based Goldman Sachs argued it had been
compelled to keep Paulson&#8217;s role secret. 
The SEC&#8217;s &#8220;proposed theory ignores the fact that, as a
broker-dealer acting as an intermediary on behalf of a client,
Goldman Sachs had a duty to keep information concerning its
client&#8217;s (Paulson&#8217;s) trades, positions and trading strategy
confidential,&#8221; the company said in a Sept. 10, 2009, document
addressed to the agency. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable company in Wall Street
history, created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages in
2007, using ACA Management LLC, a firm that analyzes credit
risk, to select underlying securities. Goldman Sachs knew that
at least one prospective investor, Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t likely to invest in a CDO that
didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager to analyze and select the
portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. Goldman Sachs misled
investors by not disclosing that Paulson had a hand in picking
the portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported first-quarter
earnings that surpassed analysts&#8217; estimates on record fixed-
income trading revenue. 
Net income almost doubled to $3.46 billion, or $5.59 a
share, from $1.81 billion, or $3.39, a year earlier, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. The average estimate
of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for $4.14 per share.
Predictions ranged from $3.33 to $5.97. 
The results showed Goldman Sachs maintained its dominance
in fixed-income trading, the biggest source of Wall Street&#8217;s
revenue. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is trying to
preserve the bank&#8217;s place as the most profitable investment bank
in Wall Street history while defending it against regulators&#8217;
claims that the company misled investors in 2007. 
&#8220;Goldman is continuing to take market share, and I think
that&#8217;s the key move for them coming out of the financial
crisis,&#8221; Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel Investment
LLC, which manages $5 billion, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;Goldman is a clear winner as people are trying to
figure out who they are going to do business with.&#8221; 
Shareholders said concern about potential fallout from the
accusations would supersede news about earnings. The stock,
which fell 13 percent after the SEC filed its case on April 16,
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday on news that the SEC was split
over whether to file the suit. The shares rose to $163.45 at
7:48 a.m. from $163.32 at the close on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday. 
SEC Case 
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, played a part in selecting the underlying
assets. Goldman Sachs has said the SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest&#8221; the case. 
Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the SEC&#8217;s
lawsuit in today&#8217;s statement, saying only, &#8220;In light of recent
events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of our
clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment of
our people.&#8221; 
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, will address
the SEC&#8217;s complaint in a conference call today, the company said
in a statement yesterday. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
will discuss earnings, the company said. 
Bank&#8217;s Reputation 
Ralph Cole, a senior vice president in research at Ferguson
Wellman Inc., is among investors who said they are concerned the
case could hurt Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation and cause clients to
switch their business to other firms. Another worry is that the
case could lead to additional lawsuits against the bank and add
impetus to financial-reform efforts that would erode Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s earnings potential. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the cost of this one suit&#8217;s the big deal,
not certainly compared to what they make,&#8221; said Cole, whose
firm manages $2.6 billion including Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It&#8217;s
what does this do to their reputation and what does this do to
the industry because of the current legislation going through?&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs said revenue from fixed-income, currencies
and commodities trading, which contributed more than half of
revenue last year, rose 13 percent in the first quarter to an
all-time high of $7.39 billion from $6.56 billion. That beat
estimates for $5.95 billion from Howard Chen at Credit Suisse
Group AG and $6.09 billion from Roger Freeman at Barclays
Capital. 
Bank of America 
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the two
biggest U.S. banks by assets, both reported record fixed-income
revenue last week of $5.52 billion and $5.46 billion
respectively. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at a great year for capital markets
firms,&#8221; Thomas Brown, CEO of Second Curve Capital LLC and
founder of bankstocks.com, said yesterday. 
Equities-trading revenue rose 18 percent to $2.35 billion
from $2 billion a year earlier, Goldman Sachs said. Gains from
principal investments, which includes the company&#8217;s stakes in
Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. as well as real
estate and other companies, were $510 million compared with a
net loss of $1.41 billion in the first quarter of 2009. 
Investment-banking revenue climbed 44 percent to $1.18
billion from $823 million last year. Within that, fees from
financial advice fell 12 percent to $464 million from $527
million and equity-underwriting revenue surged to $371 million
from $48 million. Debt underwriting generated $349 million
compared with $248 million a year earlier. 
Compensation and benefits, the firm&#8217;s biggest expense,
increased 17 percent to $5.49 billion in the quarter, or 43
percent of the firm&#8217;s overall revenue. The cost compared with
$4.71 billion in the first quarter of 2009, when the firm set
aside 50 percent of revenue.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s problems
with the Securities and Exchange Commission are spilling over
into the U.S. midterm elections. 
Congressman Mark Kirk, the Republican nominee for an open
Senate seat in Illinois, said he will return contributions made
by Goldman employees because the SEC is investigating the bank. 
Kirk, 50, made the announcement after his Democratic
opponent, Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, criticized him
for taking the donations. The two men are vying for the Senate
seat once held by President Barack Obama that will help
determine whether Democrats retain control of the chamber. 
&#8220;We are calling on Congressman Kirk to explain why he
voted against Wall Street reform,&#8221; said Matt McGrath, a
spokesman for Giannoulias. &#8220;And we are challenging him to give
back his tainted Goldman Sachs campaign contributions.&#8221; 
Kirk has taken $54,010 from Goldman employees, including
$21,600 for his Senate bid, McGrath said. 
The congressman said that his campaign is still determining
how much Goldman employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. 
&#8220;I want to set an example on ethics for others to
follow,&#8221; Kirk said yesterday during a Chicago news conference.
&#8220;I will err on the side of caution and watch this case
unfold.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp. said signings of first-quarter service contracts fell,
signaling that spending on larger technology projects may not
pick up until the second half of the year. 
Services signings, which account for more than half of
total revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, IBM,
the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, said yesterday
in a statement. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. 
Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler, who
recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York fell 2.2 percent to $129.38
in late trading yesterday after rising $1.60 to $132.23 on the
New York Stock Exchange. It had gained 1 percent this year
before today, compared with a 7.4 percent advance in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. 
Full-Year Forecast 
IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
been up 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. 
Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. 
IBM said profit this year will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts predicted
$11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Still, the company has yet to signal that profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than steps like costs cutting and
stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Broadpoint
AmTech in San Francisco. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;Really good
financial management from an earnings perspective. At the end of
the day, not much from a revenue perspective.&#8221; 
Currency Effect 
IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in its
higher-margin software and services units, which now make up
more than 80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost
gross profit margins, the percentage of sales left after
production costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year
basis. 
Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. 
Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. 
&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. U.S. government plans to put patient health records
online may spur more than $20 billion in spending, Framingham,
Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. 
First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said.

Morgan Stanley climbed the most in
three months on the New York Stock Exchange after posting
earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates on higher fixed-income
trading revenue. 
The shares rose 4 percent after the New York-based bank
said first-quarter net income was $1.78 billion, or 99 cents a
share. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.03 a share,
including a 21-cent tax benefit, compared with the 57-cent
average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income results, the best since the
third quarter of 2008, follow record revenue from debt trading
reported earlier this month by Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer
James Gorman, who succeeded John Mack in January, said in a
letter to shareholders last week he wasn&#8217;t satisfied with the
company&#8217;s performance in 2009 and the firm had hired 350
employees as part of a &#8220;revitalization&#8221; of sales and trading. 
&#8220;This was really surprising,&#8221; Thomas Brown, CEO of hedge
fund Second Curve Capital LLC in New York, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;Given the previous four quarters, where
they really looked like the weak sister, this quarter they
really stepped out. These were great numbers.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley climbed $1.23 to $31.68 at 4:01 p.m. in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after reaching
$32.29 earlier today. The shares have gained 7 percent this
year, compared with a 5.9 percent drop for Goldman Sachs and a
16 percent increase in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index. 
SEC&#8217;s Case 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s shares fell 5.6 percent on April 16, as
the SEC accused Goldman Sachs of failing to tell investors in a
2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., which planned to bet against the CDO, played a part in
selecting the underlying assets. Goldman Sachs has said the
SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that
it plans to &#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; the case. 
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a
conference call with analysts today that the firm has not
received a Wells notice, a signal of the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s intention to pursue a lawsuit, regarding its
collateralized debt obligations business. 
Revenue from fixed-income sales and trading jumped to $2.7
billion in the quarter from $1.29 billion a year earlier. That
beat estimates for $1.95 billion from Howard Chen at Credit
Suisse Group AG and $2.04 billion from Keith Horowitz at
Citigroup Inc. 
&#8216;Coming Back&#8217; 
&#8220;The fixed-income franchise is coming back for Morgan
Stanley,&#8221; Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel
Investment LLC, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. &#8220;The
history of this organization is that it&#8217;s very strong on the
fixed-income side.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs reported fixed-income revenue of $7.39
billion yesterday. Bank of America and JPMorgan, the two biggest
U.S. banks by assets, both beat analysts&#8217; earnings estimates
last week as they posted fixed-income revenue of $5.52 billion
and $5.46 billion, respectively. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s profit compared with a loss of $177
million, or 57 cents, in the first quarter of 2009, the bank
said today in a statement. Revenue more than tripled to $9.08
billion. 
Morgan Stanley generated $887 million in revenue from
investment banking, up from $811 million a year earlier. In
equities trading, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s $1.42 billion of first-
quarter revenue was up from $954 million a year earlier. The
unit&#8217;s revenue compares with $2.35 billion at Goldman Sachs and
$1.5 billion at JPMorgan. 
Smith Barney 
Global wealth management posted pretax income of $278
million, compared with $119 million in the first quarter of
2009, as the unit benefited from its joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. Asset management reported a
pretax profit of $173 million, compared with a pretax loss of
$283 million in the previous year&#8217;s first quarter. 
Morgan Stanley recorded a $932 million loss on its $1.2
billion investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC, the
developer of an unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City, New
Jersey. Porat said the company plans to dispose of the
investment in the next 12 months. 
The Revel loss was partly offset by a $775 million payment
Morgan Stanley received from Discover Financial Services to
resolve a legal dispute. Both were included in discontinued
operations. 
Wealth Management 
The wealth-management unit had $3.11 billion in revenue,
down from $3.14 billion in the fourth quarter. The brokerage&#8217;s
pretax profit margin was 9 percent, up from 7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Gorman has said the firm expects to increase
that margin to 15 percent by the end of this year and more than
20 percent by the end of 2011. 
&#8220;That progression is what we&#8217;re looking at as an
indication that the integration is continuing on track,&#8221; Porat
said in an interview. &#8220;The revenues are pretty flat from the
fourth quarter, and that reflects a more muted retail
environment. Retail investors just weren&#8217;t as active.&#8221; 
Net new client assets in the unit were $5.8 billion, the
highest since the third quarter of 2008. The unit had 18,140
advisers as of March 31 as turnover was at &#8220;historic lows,&#8221;
Porat said. 
Compensation and benefits expenses were $4.4 billion in the
quarter, or 49 percent of the firm&#8217;s overall revenue. The cost
compared with $2.08 billion in the first quarter of 2009, when
the firm set aside 68 percent of revenue. 
The compensation ratio was 41 percent in the institutional
securities business, which includes the trading and investment
banking units, and 64 percent in the wealth-management division.
Porat said the firm aims to reduce the ratio in the brokerage as
revenue increases.

Asia weathered the &#8220;Lehman shock&#8221;
of 2008 with impressive calm. Now it is being tested by a jolt
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Markets recoiled at the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud suit against Goldman. On April 19,
stocks fell the most in two months on concern that financial
companies face greater scrutiny. By the following day, all was
forgotten in Asia. 
Perhaps it dawned on traders that the SEC action is good
for the region. Its resilience amid the global crisis and
progress in decoupling from the West haven&#8217;t changed. Looking
forward, anything that brings real reform to the biggest economy
is stellar news for Asia and the rest of the world. 
When you consider the tests of the last 19 months, such as
a global credit crunch, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s
bankruptcy and Greece&#8217;s deficit woes, the odds of Asia escaping
any fallout looked grim. Especially with Japan beset by
deflation and China reliant on U.S. consumers living beyond
their means. Asia has managed to confound the skeptics, and that
isn&#8217;t about to change. 
Even the big challenge of central banks falling behind the
inflation curve is an enviable one. In Washington and Frankfurt,
the focus is on monetary policy&#8217;s limits. Near-zero interest
rates aren&#8217;t boosting growth as fast as they were supposed to.
The troubles facing officials in Hanoi and Seoul are preferable. 
Bank Stocks 
It&#8217;s worth noting that bank shares in countries such as
China and India have outperformed global rivals by about 30
percentage points since Lehman blew up in September 2008. That
dynamic should continue and even gain steam. 
A couple of years ago, many global investors considered
Asia&#8217;s regulatory environment too strict and inhibiting of
financial innovation. Nowadays, that conservatism is a virtue.
The health of Asian balance sheets and the reasonable pace of
loan growth relative to the U.S. and Europe explain why
investors are heading this way. 
Asia is hardly devoid of problems. It has done well on a
macroeconomic level during this crisis, yet it&#8217;s also been hit
hard below the surface. 
&#8220;We have 70 million-plus people still mired in poverty as
a result of the financial crisis,&#8221; Rajat Nag, managing director
of the Asian Development Bank, said on April 19. Nag, for one,
is &#8220;very pleased&#8221; with the SEC&#8217;s move to go after Goldman. 
Tightrope Walking 
Central banks have quite a bit of tightrope walking to do.
They need to be mindful of struggling households. They also must
mop up liquidity to avoid excessive asset prices. Indonesia is a
case in point: Even the central bank agrees Jakarta&#8217;s stock
market is a bubble. 
Japan&#8217;s woes are growing, too. Asia&#8217;s biggest economy was
hit hard by the financial crisis. Yet Japan&#8217;s experience jibes
with the nature of the turmoil. This crisis didn&#8217;t go to the
periphery of the global economy, but to its core. It&#8217;s the Group
of Seven economies that are reeling, not developing ones. 
The Lehman shock gave way to the &#8220;Toyota shock,&#8221; which
really was a two-part process. The first was the plunge in
Toyota Motor Corp. sales in late 2008 and into 2009. The second
was the celebrated brand&#8217;s car-safety debacle. 
If there is a silver lining here, it&#8217;s that Asia is proving
adept at living without Japan. Strong growth from China and
India don&#8217;t fill the void left by a hobbled U.S., yet it&#8217;s
helping. And so, the Asia decoupling argument gets to live on
until challenged anew by the next global crisis. 
U.S. Reform 
On that front, Goldman&#8217;s plight is actually good news.
Surprise on the part of Asian investors at the lack of financial
reform in Washington gave way to disillusionment. Signs that
U.S. regulators are finally trying to exact some justice from
Wall Street could change everything. 
That the effort involves Goldman Sachs means it&#8217;s a bit
loaded. Schadenfreude abounded last year when a Rolling Stone
magazine writer labeled Goldman a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity.&#8221; It&#8217;s an image that captured how
many in Asia viewed Wall Street following the region&#8217;s 1997
crisis. American funds came in, wrapped their tentacles around
assets and bought them on the cheap. 
A functioning U.S. financial industry is one thing; a
sustainable one is equally important. American has been sending
financial contagion Asia&#8217;s way for the past 18 months, just as
Asia sent it to the West a decade earlier. The key for the
global economy is to avoid a repeat of either scenario. 
Until now, there has been scant evidence that the U.S. was
righting its anything-goes model. The SEC&#8217;s Goldman suit is just
the tip of the iceberg. As such actions spread and financial
executives are made accountable, Asia can look forward to the
day when U.S. markets are sounder destinations for their
trillions of dollars of savings. 
Asia is working to wean itself off the U.S. In the
meantime, what&#8217;s good for the world&#8217;s dominant financial power
is good for Asia. Unlike the Lehman one, the Goldman shock may
be just the thing for this region&#8217;s prosperity.

 Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, booked a $932 million loss on its
investment in Revel Entertainment Group LLC, the developer of an
unfinished casino resort in Atlantic City, New Jersey. 
The loss on the $1.2 billion investment was included in the
New York-based firm&#8217;s first-quarter results today, according to
a statement. Morgan Stanley said this month it will sell the
stalled casino on 20 acres of beachfront property along Atlantic
City&#8217;s boardwalk. 
Morgan Stanley bought the land for $74 million in 2006.
Planned as the biggest casino resort in Atlantic City, Revel
needs more than $1 billion to complete the project. Morgan
Stanley, which owns 95 percent of the development, contributed
the land to developer Kevin DeSanctis and funded construction. 
&#8220;The intent was to build it out and eventually sell it,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an
interview today. &#8220;With the ongoing weakness in Atlantic City,
our judgment was that we do not want to put more money into it.
We would be better off selling it to a more natural owner.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley rose $1.30, or 4.3 percent, to $31.75 at
11:23 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had gained 2.9 percent this year before today. 
Since 2008, the firm has been winding down Morgan Stanley
Principal Investments, the unit that invested in Revel and other
companies and projects for the bank&#8217;s own account, Mark Lake, a
Morgan Stanley spokesman, said today in an interview. 
Loan Negotiations 
Revel has been negotiating with the Export-Import Bank of
China for a loan to finish construction, New Jersey gaming
enforcement documents show. Morgan Stanley Chairman John Mack
&#8220;recently spoke&#8221; to China Ex-Im&#8217;s chairman about loan terms,
according to documents dated Feb. 17 and submitted to the
state&#8217;s casino commission by the Division of Gaming Enforcement. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Lake declined to comment on the documents. 
&#8220;Revel remains fully engaged in discussions with potential
lenders on securing the remaining capital required to complete
the interior fit-out of the property and the completion of the
construction phase of the project,&#8221; Joe Jaffoni, an outside
spokesman for Revel, said today in an e-mail. &#8220;Once final
financing is secured, we estimate it will take 20 months to
complete and open the facility.&#8221; 
Atlantic City gambling revenue tumbled a record 13 percent
last year, the third straight annual decline, after nearby
states allowed slot machines. Six of the 11 New Jersey casinos
wound up in bankruptcy or restructuring, and development has
stalled. New Jersey&#8217;s budget last month projected the casinos
may generate 12 percent less in tax revenue in the coming fiscal
year.

Morgan Stanley, which reported
earnings today that beat analyst&#8217;s estimates, said the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 17 percent in the
first quarter. 
Value-at-risk in commodity prices, a measure of how much
the firm estimates it might lose in a single day, rose to $27
million in the three months ended March 31 from $23 million in
the preceding quarter, the company said. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history, said yesterday that the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 29 percent in the
first quarter. 
Value-at-risk rose to $49 million in the three months ended
March 31 from $38 million in the preceding quarter, the company

The nation&#8217;s largest banks are
pumping more money into the battle over the rewriting of the
rules of finance as legislation heads to a vote in the Senate as
early as this week. 
Six of the top 10 U.S. banks by assets, including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley,
ramped up donations to lawmakers from their political action
committees in the last month, according to reports filed for
yesterday&#8217;s Federal Election Commission deadline. 
Goldman, Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp were among
seven banks that increased the amount spent on lobbying during
the first three months of the year compared with the same period
in 2009, separate reports filed with Congress showed. The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce doubled its lobbying spending in the first
quarter. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re in the endgame,&#8221; said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer
program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
which is pressing for stronger regulations. &#8220;They&#8217;re all-in to
defeat reform.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.,
all based in New York, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. each donated
more to federal candidates in March than in the previous two
months combined.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
signaled it will fight a U.S. lawsuit over subprime mortgage
instruments the same way Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch
unit and UBS AG have challenged similar claims -- by invoking
the concept of caveat emptor: Latin for buyer beware. 
The strategy may work. By insisting that purchasers of
collateralized debt obligations knew what they were getting
into, Goldman Sachs is following a well-traveled path. Both
Merrill and UBS won dismissal of similar claims that they
misrepresented the risks of such assets by saying the buyers
were sophisticated enough to know better. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of creating and selling the CDOs without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the instrument. Goldman Sachs denied any
wrongdoing, saying that it provided &#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to
customers about the risks. 
Goldman Sachs, whose mantra is clients&#8217; interests always
come first, has said &#8220;these are sophisticated investors who
knew what they were buying,&#8221; said David Irwin, a former federal
prosecutor in private practice in Towson, Maryland. The bank is
arguing that the average buyer of this product isn&#8217;t some
&#8220;credit union that didn&#8217;t know what it was doing,&#8221; he said. 
In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market began to falter,
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO vehicle, known as Abacus,
linking it to bundles of subprime mortgages whose value would
rise or fall depending on whether homeowners paid them off. 
The SEC alleged in its April 16 complaint that, had Goldman
Sachs customers known Paulson helped choose the securities that
formed the basis of the CDO, and that Paulson was betting
against them, they might not have bought any. The regulator&#8217;s
case in Manhattan federal court may hinge on that issue, said
lawyer Mark Zauderer of New York&#8217;s Flemming Zulack Williamson
Zauderer LLC, who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. 
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
CDOs and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. 
Goldman Sachs also said yesterday that the U.S. case hinges
on the actions of an employee it placed on paid leave this week. 
 Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about the
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will be de-registered from
the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm in London said yesterday. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; 
By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publicly distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. 
Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP in
New York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. The New York-
based bank has denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the
SEC&#8217;s case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and
fact.&#8221; 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan).

Legal Reviews 
BHP Says It Found Evidence of Possible Corruption 
 BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company,
found evidence of possible breaches of anti-corruption laws
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information for an investigation. 
BHP identified &#8220;possible violations of applicable anti-
corruption laws involving interactions with government
officials,&#8221; Melbourne-based BHP said today in a statement. The
U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office said BHP &#8220;opened a dialogue&#8221; and
is cooperating. 
The company said the probe into the termination of some
minerals exploration projects didn&#8217;t involve its business in China, where four Rio Tinto Group executives were jailed last
month for bribery. U.S. regulators have increased scrutiny of
corporate governance and compliance following the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
The SEC couldn&#8217;t &#8220;confirm or deny the existence or non-
existence of any investigation,&#8221; John Nester, a Washington-
based spokesman, said in an e-mail. 
BHP &#8220;has been in to see us,&#8221; David Jones, a spokesman for
the U.K.&#8217;s SFO, said in an e-mail. The Australian Securities and
Investments Commission couldn&#8217;t comment, spokeswoman Georgie
Morell said. 
BHP has exploration projects in Chile, Zambia, Australia,
Gabon, South America, Russia, West Africa and Canada, the
company said today in its quarterly exploration report, in which
it revealed the probe.

Goldman Faces Formal U.K. Probe After SEC Fraud Suit 
The London units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, will be formally
investigated by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator after U.S.
authorities sued the bank for fraud. 
The Financial Services Authority said in a statement
yesterday that it will begin a formal probe after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. The FSA
said yesterday it was reviewing whether a full investigation
into the New York-based bank was warranted. 
Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on the agency, which he
created in 1997, to investigate Goldman Sachs, accusing
employees of the bank of &#8220;moral bankruptcy.&#8221; The bank may be
fined or individuals banned if the FSA finds a breach of its
rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president named in the SEC case,
Fabrice Tourre, works at the bank&#8217;s London office. 
&#8220;The U.K. entity, Goldman Sachs International, is not
mentioned in the SEC complaint, but the FSA&#8217;s latest move means
that this part of Goldman Sachs is now under the spotlight
too,&#8221; said Clive Cunningham, a regulatory lawyer at Taylor
Wessing LLP who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &#8220;The question is
whether Goldman Sachs International was involved and, if so, did
it breach any U.K. regulatory rules.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs will cooperate with the FSA&#8217;s investigation,
the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The bank has
previously denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the SEC&#8217;s
case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
Tourre, 31, has been placed on paid leave until an
unspecified date, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said yesterday.
Pamela Chepiga, Tourre&#8217;s lawyer at Allen  Overy LLP in New
York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment.

New Suits 
Staten Island Investment Adviser Charged With Fraud 
Gryphon Holdings Inc.&#8217;s owner and four employees of the
Staten Island, New York-based investment firm were charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in an
alleged $17.5 million scheme. 
Kenneth Marsh, 43, Gryphon&#8217;s president, and the employees,
who are accused of falsely claiming endorsements from financier
George Soros, are scheduled to appear in court yesterday,
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell said in an e-mailed
statement. 
Investors, usually elderly retirees, received unsolicited
e-mails and phone calls touting Gryphon&#8217;s services, according to
the statement. Once the victims provided contact information,
Gryphon&#8217;s employees used high-pressure tactics and
misrepresentations to sell more expensive versions of their
services, Campbell said.

Banca Carige Sues Citigroup Over Note, Swap Deal 
 Banca Carige SpA sued Citigroup Inc. for misrepresenting as
safe a deal that allegedly cost the northern Italian bank almost
all of its $47 million investment. 
Citigroup put its own interests above Banca Carige&#8217;s in
January 2007 when it sold 10 million euros ($13.5 million) in a
fund-linked note to the bank&#8217;s insurance units and entered into
a 25 million euro fund-linked total return swap with Banca
Carige, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Manhattan. 
Banca Carige and the insurers &#8220;had no interest in risky or
speculative investments, and were looking only to obtain good,
consistent returns with as little risk as possible,&#8221; the Genoa-
based bank wrote in its complaint. 
Citigroup knew the investors&#8217; objectives and misrepresented
that the deal was a low-risk investment because the note and the
swap were linked to an offshore bond fund that &#8220;earned reliable
returns through an &#8216;arbitrage opportunity&#8217; with municipal
bonds,&#8221; Banca Carige said. 
&#8220;Citi believes these claims are without merit and we will
defend ourselves vigorously,&#8221; Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based company, said by e-mail. 
The case is Banca Carige SpA v. Citigroup Inc., 10-cv-3310,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Household International Sues Insurer Over Coverage 
Household International Inc., found liable last year by a
Chicago jury for misleading investors about the company&#8217;s
business practices, sued an insurance company in a bid to force
payment of its legal bills. 
Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co., based in Hamilton,
Bermuda, is refusing to provide $25 million of coverage,
contending that some of the claims in the lawsuit predate Nov.
1, 2000, when the policy went into effect, Household Financial
said yesterday in documents in federal court in Chicago. 
&#8220;It is virtually certain that the entire limits of the
Princeton policy will be needed for ongoing defense costs,&#8221;
Household said in its statement of claim. &#8220;Princeton flatly
denied Household&#8217;s request for payment.&#8221; 
The jury last May 8 found the company and three executives
including Chief Executive Officer William Aldinger, misled
investors from 1994 to 2005 with reckless remarks in financial
statements, inflating the value of the shares. 
The insurance case is Household International Inc. v.
Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co. 1:10-cv-02418. U.S. District
Court, and the shareholder suit is Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension
Plan v. Household International Inc., 1:02-cv-05893, U.S.

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Judge Calls New York&#8217;s Greenberg Case &#8216;Devastating&#8217; 
New York&#8217;s case against American International Group Inc.&#8217;s
former Chief Executive Officer Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg is
&#8220;devastating,&#8221; State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos said
yesterday during a court hearing. 
The judge is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2005 by
then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer that accused
Greenberg, 84, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard
Smith of using sham reinsurance deals and other transactions to
distort the reported financial condition of the company. 
Assistant Attorney General David Ellenhorn yesterday told
Ramos that Greenberg directed or participated in fraudulent
transactions. David Boies, Greenberg&#8217;s lawyer, said the state
had &#8220;failed&#8221; and was relying on hearsay and inadmissible
evidence from a federal case in which Greenberg wasn&#8217;t a
defendant. 
&#8220;I can see big problems with establishing a defense&#8221; to
the state&#8217;s claims about securities fraud, Ramos told Boies.
&#8220;Mr. Ellenhorn has put together a devastating case, a strong
case, and we both know it.&#8221; 
Greenberg&#8217;s lawyers and attorneys from New York Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s office are each asking Ramos in Manhattan
to grant their motion for summary judgment, or a decision before
trial. Greenberg has also asked, in the alternative, for Ramos
to dismiss the lawsuit. The former CEO wasn&#8217;t in court
yesterday. 
Greenberg has accused Spitzer of using the case to promote
his political career, according to a filing in state Supreme
Court. 
The case is New York v. Maurice Greenberg, 401720/2005, New
York Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).

Trials/Appeals 
Rorech Testifies in First Insider-Trading Default-Swap Case 
Jon-Paul Rorech, the Deutsche Bank AG bond salesman who&#8217;s a
defendant in U.S. regulators&#8217; first insider-trading case over
credit-default swaps, took the stand in the trial. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Rorech,
39, of illegally feeding information on a 2006 bond sale by
Dutch media company VNU Group BV to Renato Negrin, 46, a former
Millennium Partners LP portfolio manager. Negrin, Rorech&#8217;s co-
defendant, bought swaps to reap a $1.2 million profit when the
deal was announced, the SEC said in a complaint in May. 
Nancy Brown, an SEC lawyer, asked Rorech yesterday if he
understood in July 2006 that Deutsche Bank had &#8220;restricted&#8221;
VNU&#8217;s securities. 
&#8220;At one point I believe we were restricted from trading
securities but I did not believe I was restricted from
soliciting,&#8221; Rorech responded. &#8220;How can you market without
discussing what the relevant securities are?&#8221; 
Rorech, who is on paid administrative leave from Deutsche
Bank, is scheduled to continue his testimony today. U.S.
District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan is hearing the
nonjury trial, which began April 7. 
The SEC didn&#8217;t accuse Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank or New
York-based hedge fund Millennium of wrongdoing. 
The commission&#8217;s civil suit focuses on efforts by VNU,
later renamed Nielsen Co., to restructure its debt as part of a
7.5 billion euro ($10 billion) leveraged buyout. 
After complaints from potential investors that the $1.67
billion in bonds wouldn&#8217;t be covered by existing VNU credit-
default swaps, VNU created a tranche of bonds that would be
covered. 
The SEC said Rorech tipped Negrin about the restructuring
before that announcement. Negrin bought 20 million euros of
swaps, and profited by selling them after the deal was announced
and the swap price rose, the SEC said. 
Negrin is liable because he knew, or should have known,
Rorech had a duty to keep the information private, the SEC said. 
Rorech and Negrin argue that the SEC has no jurisdiction
over the credit-default swaps because they are private
contracts, not securities. 
The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Rorech,
1:09-cv-04329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). 
Former IKB Chief May Call More Witnesses After Goldman Case 
Former IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG Chief Executive
Officer Stefan Ortseifen may call more witnesses at his German
criminal trial following the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Ortseifen, 59, is on trial on charges that he failed to
warn investors about the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage
market before the bank was forced to seek a government bailout.
The bank lost nearly all of its $150 million investment in the
subprime-mortgage related products at the center of the SEC case
against Goldman Sachs. 
&#8220;We are considering calling more and other people to
witness in the case,&#8221; Rainer Hamm, his lawyer, said in an
interview at a court in Dusseldorf, Germany, where Ortseifen is
being tried for misleading investors. Ortseifen is observing the
Goldman development &#8220;with big interest&#8221; and it is too early to
say if he will change his defense strategy, the lawyer said. 
IKB was bailed out in 2007 by KfW Group and banking
associations and has received guarantees of as much as 12
billion euros ($16.2 billion) from the Soffin bank-rescue fund.
Ortseifen is charged with misleading investors by downplaying
the effect of the real estate crisis in a press release on July
20, 2007. Ortseifen stepped down nine days later and shares of
IKB fell 20 percent. 
The SEC says a Goldman executive misled a collateral
manager, ACA Management LLC, and IKB about Paulson&#8217;s role. 
The German case is LG Dusseldorf, 14 KLs 6/09.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Schwab Agrees to Pay $200 Million in Fund Settlement 
 Charles Schwab Corp. said it agreed to pay $200 million to
settle claims that it misled investors on the amount of
mortgage-backed securities held by its Schwab YieldPlus Fund. 
Schwab signed a memorandum of understanding to settle the
claims filed in 2008 by paying the $200 million to plaintiffs,
without admitting liability and avoiding trial, the San
Francisco-based company said yesterday in a statement. The
settlement agreement cuts first-quarter net income by $105
million, or 9 cents a share, bringing the company&#8217;s net income
reported last week down to $14 million, or 1 cent per share. 
The lawsuit alleged that Schwab incorrectly described the
fund, once the world&#8217;s largest short-term bond fund, as
&#8220;safe.&#8221; The plaintiffs sought damages of as much as $802
million, the estimate of losses made by their lawyers&#8217; experts.
A trial was scheduled for May. 
Schwab had denied wrongdoing, saying the fund&#8217;s losses were
caused by the collapse of the financial markets. U.S. District
Judge William H. Alsup denied Schwab&#8217;s bid to dismiss the case
earlier this month. 
The case is In Re Charles Schwab Corp. Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-01510, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Francisco). 
Schottenfeld Settlement in Galleon SEC Case Approved 
Schottenfeld Group LLC won a judge&#8217;s approval of a $763,000
settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
the Galleon Group LLC insider-trading investigation. 
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York approved the
agreement in an order yesterday. Schottenfeld Group agreed to
pay $460,475 in disgorgement, $72,203 in interest and a $230,238
civil penalty, according to a March 29 letter from the SEC to
Rakoff. The firm also agreed to implement policies to assure
compliance with securities laws. 
Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam is accused in both civil and
criminal cases of using secret tips from hedge fund executives,
corporate officials and other insiders to earn millions of
dollars in illegal stock trades. Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi,
a New Castle Funds LLC consultant, are among 21 people who were
charged criminally since October in two overlapping insider
trading cases. 
Zvi Goffer and David Plate, formerly of Schottenfeld Group,
have pleaded not guilty in the criminal case. Gautham Shankar, a
former trader at Schottenfeld Group, pleaded guilty and is
cooperating with prosecutors. 
Schottenfeld Group&#8217;s disgorgement represents the amount the
firm either profited or avoided losing in the Galleon case,
according to the SEC&#8217;s letter. 
The criminal case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
SEC case is SEC v. Galleon Management LP, 09-cv-08811, U.S.

Ex-Siemens Managers Get Suspended Terms Over Bribery 
Two former managers at Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s biggest
engineering company, were found guilty of breach of trust by a
Munich court and received suspended sentences and fines. 
A former unit chief executive officer, identified only as
Joerg Michael K., 55, received a suspended sentence of two years
and was ordered to pay 160,000 euros ($215,000), the Munich
court said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The head of
accounting at the unit, Hans-Werner H., 55, received an 18-month
suspended sentence and was ordered to pay 40,000 euros. 
&#8220;Both men tolerated and supported a system of slush funds
at Siemens,&#8221; the court said. The system was &#8220;set up for the
sole purpose of paying bribes.&#8221; 
Siemens, based in Munich, has been embroiled in a bribery
scandal since 2006, leading to investigations in at least a
dozen countries, revealing it paid kickbacks and bribes to win
contracts. Siemens agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settle probes
in the U.S. and Germany in 2008. Prosecution of individual
managers has been ongoing. 
Joerg Michael K., who joined Siemens in 1974, became the
head of the communications unit in 2001. He was told about the
system of slush funds and chose not to stop it. He later gave
another Siemens employee in charge of organizing the system
powers to sign sham contracts. 
Hans-Werner H., who learned about the scheme in 2003,
didn&#8217;t have his accounting staff thoroughly review the
transactions, according to the court. Between 2002 and 2004, the
system put 49 million euros in the slush funds which were used
for bribery. 
Boehringer Agrees to Settle Wisconsin Medicaid Suit 
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, the world&#8217;s largest privately
held drugmaker, agreed to pay $7.75 million to settle Wisconsin
claims that it overcharged a government health program for
medicine. 
Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim
Roxane, Roxane Laboratories and Ben Venue Laboratories, all
units of Boehringer, agreed to pay the state Medicaid program $7
million and $750,000 to Miner, Barnhill  Galland PC for legal
fees, in a settlement announced yesterday by Wisconsin Attorney
General J.B. Van Hollen. 
&#8220;This settlement again demonstrates to anyone who attempts
to defraud medical assistance programs that my office will
pursue them to the fullest extent of the law,&#8221; Van Hollen said
in a statement. The state won&#8217;t &#8220;line the pockets of those who
would engage in deceptive and fraudulent pricing activities.&#8221; 
Boehringer, based in Ingelheim, Germany, complies with all
federal and state Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, Amy Kunkel,
a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;This case was settled to end expensive and disruptive
litigation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wisconsin acknowledged that the
settlement did not constitute an admission of fault or liability
by Boehringer.&#8221; 
The case is State of Wisconsin v. Abbott Inc., 04-cv-1709,
Dane County (Madison). 
Vodafone, O2 Win U.K. Appeal of Price Controls 
 Vodafone Group Plc, Telefonica SA&#8217;s O2 unit and other
mobile network operators overturned a U.K. ruling that applied
retroactive price controls that cut fees they charge to connect
callers from other networks. 
The Court of Appeal in London yesterday ruled that a lower
court couldn&#8217;t force the U.K.&#8217;s telecommunications regulator
Ofcom to apply a court-ordered reduction of limits on
&#8220;termination fees&#8221; back to 2007. The other operators are
France Telecom SA&#8217;s Orange unit and Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s T-Mobile. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied that the tribunal has no power to direct
Ofcom to impose revised price controls on a retrospective
basis,&#8221; said the three judge panel. The money involved in the
case amounts to &#8220;hundreds of millions of pounds,&#8221; the judges
said in the ruling. 
The ruling is a victory for Ofcom, which challenged a
finding by the Competition Appeal Tribunal that it should apply
price controls retroactively when charges are reduced further by
a court. Ofcom was ordered in 2009 to further cut price controls
it had already lowered in 2007. 
Simon Gordon, a Vodafone spokesman, and Simon Lloyd, a
spokesman for O2, didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment.

Obama Considers Corporate Lawyer for Justice Department Job 
James M. Cole, a corporate defense lawyer who served as an
independent monitor of American International Group Inc., is
being vetted by the Obama administration for the No. 2 job at
the Justice Department, according to a person familiar with the
matter. 
Cole, a partner at Bryan Cave LLP in Washington and a
former Justice Department prosecutor, would replace former
Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden, who left office earlier
this year. If nominated by Obama, Cole would need to be
confirmed by the Senate. 
Cole was an official with the Justice Department for 13
years before entering private practice, according to his law
firm&#8217;s Web site. His law practice includes advising companies on
securities, regulatory and criminal law matters.

Lawyers Made $60,000 From U.K. Insider Scam, Prosecutors Say 
Two attorneys who worked at the London offices of U.S. law
firms made illegal trades in NeuTec Pharma Ltd. after the
company&#8217;s financial director leaked information about a proposed
takeover, prosecutors told a court. 
Andrew Rimmington, a former corporate partner at Dorsey 
Whitney LLP,  Michael McFall, an ex-corporate partner at
McDermott Will  Emery LLP and NeuTec&#8217;s former financial
director Peter King are on trial for insider trading in a case
brought by the Financial Services Authority. 
Prosecutor Michael Bowes said the two lawyers made a profit
of 39,000 pounds each ($60,000) in June 2006 after King gave
McFall an early warning about Basel-based Novartis AG&#8217;s plan to
purchase NeuTec. McFall then passed the information on to
Rimmington, Bowes said. The men deny wrongdoing. 
They will present their defense later in the case, which is
scheduled to last six weeks.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, won an appeals patent case in Germany
over its file allocation table technology, or FAT, that allows
older computer operating systems to run alongside new software
using long file names. 
The Federal Court of Justice granted Microsoft&#8217;s appeal
against a lower court ruling, the court said in an e-mail today.
The case concerned the validity of European Patent EP 0618 540
in Germany. After hearing the case yesterday, the country&#8217;s top
civil tribunal overturned a ruling by Germany&#8217;s Federal Patent
Court that said the patent must be voided as it didn&#8217;t contain
an invention of new technology. 
The technology can be used by devices including digital
cameras and automotive navigation systems. Microsoft, holding
equivalent U.S. patents, last year sued Dutch navigation-device
maker TomTom NV over the technology used in global-positioning
systems for cars. The companies settled. 
The patent protects technology that makes Microsoft&#8217;s MS-
DOS operating system, which can only handle files of up to eight
digits, compatible with applications that use longer names. It
allowed Microsoft to introduce its VFAT file system, making it
compatible with MS-DOS&#8217;s FAT file system. 
The Federal Patent Court had argued that the Rock Ridge
Interchange Protocol, used for file storages on CD-ROMs, had
already introduced the method. 
The case is BGH, X ZR 27/07.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, told Japanese clients
the collateralized debt obligation at the center of a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit wasn&#8217;t sold in the country. 
Goldman Sachs also said its Japanese asset management unit
didn&#8217;t participate in structuring or selling the CDO, according
to a Japanese-language letter to clients, a copy of which was
obtained by Bloomberg News. Representatives from the firm will
visit clients to provide additional explanation if requested,
the letter said. 
&#8220;We are explaining to our clients in Japan that the
synthetic CDO in question was not sold in Japan,&#8221; said Hiroko
Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. Matsumoto,
who confirmed the contents of the letter, said Japanese clients
began receiving it earlier this week. She declined to
comment on their responses. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
New York-based company misled investors in a collateralized debt
obligation, called Abacus 2007-AC1. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon
Brown has asked for Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority to
start an inquiry, as the ramifications of the suit affect the
company globally. 
The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO, which was
linked to subprime mortgages, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicle. The hedge fund wasn&#8217;t sued by the SEC. 
Goldman Sachs in its letter to Japanese clients said the
SEC suit is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; 
The bank said yesterday its net income rose 91 percent to
$3.46 billion, or $5.59 per share, in the three months through
March.

A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
was sued by a former employee who said the bank fired him
without cause and breached a spinout agreement that allowed him
to leave with the private equity team and platform he managed. 
Varun Kumar Bery, former head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Private Capital
Asia unit, filed the complaint on Monday against his former
employer in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance claiming damages
&#8220;in the region of US$30.8 million.&#8221; JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie
Cheung declined to comment on the matter. 
According to the complaint, Bery joined JPMorgan in January
2008 after negotiations with Gaby Abdelnour, the bank&#8217;s Asia-
Pacific chairman and chief executive officer, to establish a
private equity group within the firm. 
The complaint states that after a firm-wide reorganization
in 2009 when JPMorgan disbanded an investment-banking unit that
bet on leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and real estate, the head
of a new global special opportunities business, Chris Nicholas,
indicated the bank wouldn&#8217;t commit more capital to Bery&#8217;s group. 
Abdelnour told Bery that JPMorgan &#8220;did not intend to
permit&#8221; the spinout, or departure of the business, according to
the complaint. 
Bery, 51, alleges the bank later acknowledged through its
lawyers breaching the spinout agreement and &#8220;did not proceed
expeditiously, constructively or responsively with the
negotiations&#8221; of finalizing the spinout. 
The fund manager is seeking a court order for the bank to
carry out the agreement and to recover any losses due to the
delay. 
The case is HCCL9/2010 in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First
Instance.

U.S. and European non-financial
companies may sell Kangaroo bonds for the first time in four
years to profit from historically-low currency swap costs,
according to Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty. 
The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. affiliate is in talks with
potential borrowers about sales of local-currency notes in
Australia, head of debt capital markets Robert Foale said in an
interview in Sydney, declining to name the companies. Vodafone
Group Plc raised A$265 million ($247 million) in August 2006 in
the last Kangaroo sale by a non-financial company, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll see new corporate names in the Kangaroo
market in the next six months, and over the next 12 months it
should build up some momentum,&#8221; Foale said. &#8220;If they can
access a new market, diversify funding and currency, and they
don&#8217;t have to pay up for it, it&#8217;s a great opportunity.&#8221; 
Scottish Power Ltd. and Vodafone were among overseas
companies that sold bonds in Australia before the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred investors to retreat to
the relative safety of government debt, closing the Kangaroo
market to all but supranational lenders and state-backed
borrowers. JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised A$700 million from
Kangaroo notes last month after credit markets thawed.

Contributions from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. employees threaten to become toxic campaign assets
for both political parties facing elections this year. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hard for Democrats to make the accusation
about Republicans because the president raised so much Goldman
Sachs money,&#8221; said John Feehery, a Republican political
strategist who advised former House Speaker Dennis Hastert. 
Donations from the bank&#8217;s employees became an issue when
U.S. Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias pushed his Republican
opponent in Illinois to return such contributions after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a fraud lawsuit April
16 against Goldman Sachs. 
Giannoulias said the money sent to the campaign of his
opponent, Republican congressman Mark Kirk, is &#8220;tainted,&#8221;
without saying whether President Barack Obama should return
almost $1 million that bank employees contributed to his White
House bid. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs employees tend to have a lot of money that
they can give to politicians,&#8221; Feehery said. &#8220;They are very
good at reading the marketplace.&#8221; 
Obama and Democrats in Congress are proposing the most
sweeping financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
personal push by the president, who plans to deliver a speech on
the subject on April 22 at the Cooper Union in New York, comes
as Goldman reported its net income almost doubled in the first
quarter. 
California Cash 
Obama, 48, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
Kirk, competing against Giannoulias for the seat once held
by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from Goldman employees, the
center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are Democratic Congressman
Michael McMahon of New York, Republican Senator Richard Shelby
of Alabama, and three other New York Democrats: Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand, Representative Scott Murphy and Senator Charles
Schumer. 
Gillibrand, 43, will wait to see whether Goldman loses its
case, said Matt Canter, a spokesman. 
&#8220;It is long-standing practice for the Gillibrand campaign
that if any contributor is found guilty of wrongdoing, then the
campaign immediately donates their contribution to charity,&#8221;
Canter said. 
Democratic Party officials dismissed the significance of
Goldman campaign contributions to Obama. 
&#8216;Tooth and Nail&#8217; 
&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail
against the needed reforms the administration is advocating,&#8221;
Hari Sevugan, Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement. 
Sevugan didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail query when asked
whether Obama plans to return money from Goldman Sachs
employees. Jen Psaki, a White House spokeswoman, deferred
questions about contributions to the DNC. 
Giannoulias, 34, the Illinois treasurer, criticized Kirk
April 19 for taking what he said totaled $21,600 from Goldman
Sachs employees for the Senate campaign. 
Kirk, a five-term congressman from Chicago&#8217;s northern
suburbs, said he wanted to &#8220;err on the side of caution&#8221; as the
SEC case unfolded. 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Lucas van Praag, declined to
comment yesterday on the question of contributions to Obama and
other politicians. 
Still Counting 
Kirk, 50, said that his campaign is still determining how
much Goldman Sachs employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. 
Goldman Sachs and its employees and family members gave
$5.9 million to candidates in the 2007-2008 election cycle, data
from the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics shows.
Three-quarters of that went to Democrats, the non-partisan group
said. 
Giannoulias&#8217;s campaign further criticized Kirk yesterday
for agreeing to return contributions to his Senate campaign and
not the full $54,010 it says Kirk has taken from Goldman
employees during his congressional career. 
&#8220;His artfully worded pledge to return contributions made
only in the current cycle offers a fig leaf of ethical
propriety, but in reality is nothing more than a typical
Washington politician&#8217;s trick,&#8221; Giannoulias spokesman Matt
McGrath said in a statement. 
Fraud Allegations 
The SEC filed a civil suit alleging Goldman failed to tell
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet against the CDO, helped
select the underlying assets. 
The bank has denied the SEC&#8217;s accusations and Greg Palm,
co-general counsel, told analysts on a conference call yesterday
that the firm didn&#8217;t intentionally mislead anyone. 
For Obama, Wall Street provided three of his seven biggest
sources of contributors for the 2008 presidential campaign. In
2007 and 2008, Goldman Sachs employees and family members gave
him $994,795, Citigroup Inc. $701,290, and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
$695,132. 
Kathleen Strand, a Giannoulias spokeswoman, declined to
provide a yes or no response when asked whether Obama should
give money back to Goldman employees. 
&#8220;Unlike President Obama, Republican Congressman Mark Kirk
takes Wall Street money hand over fist and then votes their way
every single time, including voting against Wall Street
reform,&#8221; she said in a statement. 
Kirk&#8217;s Money Lead 
Kirk raised $2.2 million during the first quarter of 2010
and ended the period with more than $3 million in the bank, his
campaign said April 7. 
Giannoulias raised $1.2 million during the first quarter
and ended the period with that amount in the bank, his campaign
said last week. 
The Senate seat in Illinois is held by Democrat Roland
Burris, who isn&#8217;t seeking a full term. Republicans are trying to
take advantage of ethical problems experienced by Illinois
Democrats, including a public corruption trial set to begin June
3 for former Governor Rod Blagojevich, who appointed Burris to
complete Obama&#8217;s term.

Apple Gets Patent for Digital Camera Color-Correction Technology 
Apple Inc., maker of the iPhone, iPod and iPad, received a
U.S. patent that may point the way to an iCamera for the
Cupertino, California-based company. 
Yesterday Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs
tantalized investors with the promise of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; new
products. And April 15 Apple filed a patent-infringement
complaint with the International Trade Commission to block
imports of some Eastman Kodak Co. digital cameras 
Patent 7,701,489, which was issued to Apple April 20, is
for a method and apparatus for color correction in image-sensing
devices. The technology covered by the patent involved the use
of diffusers to determine the properties of the lighting
environment. 
This is in contrast to many digital cameras&#8217; dependence on
software&#8217;s predetermined assumptions about lighting, according
to the patent. 
Apple applied for this patent in May 2003, with the
assistance of Blakely, Sokoloff, Taylor  Zafman LLP of Los
Angeles. 
Yamaha Sued for Infringing Patents on Web Site Paper Models 
Yamaha Motor Co., the motorcycle maker second in size only
to Honda Motor Co., was sued for patent infringement by a
Chicago-based patent owner. 
Paper Models LLC accused Yamaha of infringing its patents
7,072,949 and 7,546,356, which were issued in July 2006 and June
2009 respectively. 
The two patents cover systems for providing paper model
replicas over a computer network. Yamaha&#8217;s &#8220;papercraft&#8221;
offerings on its Web site infringe these patents, Paper Models
claimed in a suit filed yesterday in federal court in Chicago. 
When accessed yesterday, the Yamaha Web site entertainment
section featured pattern sheets and instructions for making
paper models of motorcycles, animals and various Japanese
cultural artifacts such as festival shrines, doll displays and
Samurai helmets. 
Paper Models asked the court for an order barring Honda&#8217;s
future infringement of the two patents, and for money damages,
attorney fees and the costs of litigation, and requested that
any damage award be tripled. 
The patent holder is represented by Mark D. Roth of
Chicago&#8217;s Orum  Roth LLC. 
The case is Paper Models LLC v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 1:10-
cv-02459, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois

Bionovo Gets Patent for Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment  &#8216; 
Bionovo Inc. received a patent on a method of using a
Chinese medicinal herb for the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer, the Emeryville, California-based company said in a
statement. 
Patent 7,700,136 covers the use of an extract of
Scutellaria barbata to arrest cancer cell growth and shrink
solid cancers. In addition to breast cancer, the patent also
covers the use of the extract to treat ovarian cancer. Bezielle
is Bionovo&#8217;s proprietary formulation of the extract. 
The extract is formed from the above-ground portions of the
plant in either a water or alcohol-based solution, according to
the patent. The plant is a member of the mint family. 
The patent was issued April 20. Bionovo applied for the
patent in November 2008, with the assistance of Wilson, Sonsini,
Goodrich  Rosati of Palo Alto, California. 
According to the company statement, Bionovo has had two
positive Phase 1 clinical trials of Bezielle.

ACTA Text Released, Provides Damages Provisions, ISP Liability 
The parties to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
released a draft text of the accord yesterday, together with a
statement from the European Commission&#8217;s Directorate-General for
Trade that said &#8220;concerns&#8221; about the agreement &#8220;are
unfounded.&#8221; 
The U.S. is a party to the agreement, as are Australia,
Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New
Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland. 
Among the elements in the agreement is the question of
damages for infringement. According to the draft text, judicial
authorities should consider &#8220;any legitimate measure of value&#8221;
including lost profits, value of the infringed good or service
measured by market price, the suggested retail price or the
profits of the infringer attributable to the infringement. 
One section of the agreement appears to offer the
possibility of preventative action. Judicial authorities will
have the authority to issue an order intended to prevent &#8220;the
imminent infringement&#8221; of an IP right. 
This includes the provisions that customs authorities can,
on their own authority, act to &#8220;suspend the release&#8221; of goods
suspected of infringement. 
The agreement places the burden on Internet service
providers to &#8220;remove or disable access to infringing material
or infringing activity upon obtaining actual knowledge of the

Toyota Sued for Infringement by Owner of &#8216;Prove It!&#8217; Trademark 
Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s Toyota USA unit was sued for trademark
infringement by an Arizona resident who registered the phrase
&#8220;prove it!&#8221; as a U.S. trademark in 1998. 
Michael D. Calmese of Phoenix accused Toyota of breaching a
license agreement to use the phrase that ended Dec. 31, 2009.
Toyota used the phrase in its promotions after that date without
authorization, according to the complaint filed April 19 in
federal court in Phoenix. 
He claims that he is damaged by the automaker&#8217;s
unauthorized use of his mark, in light of &#8220;the negative image&#8221;
the Japanese automaker has as a result of its recent recalls of
defective autos. By Toyota&#8217;s &#8220;not coming clean about its
acceleration and brake problems,&#8221; Calmese has potentially been
damaged by the association&#8221; with the company, he said in his
pleadings. 
Calmese claims he&#8217;s won trademark disputes with other
companies, and asked the court to award him money damages, and
extra damaged intended to punish the automaker for its alleged
infringement. He also seeks an award of attorney fees,
litigation costs and an order barring future infringement of his
mark. 
He is unrepresented by counsel. 
The case is Calmese V. Toyota USA Inc., 2:10-cv-00857-JWS,
U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix) 
Singapore Raid Nets Counterfeit Electronics Worth $2.7 Million 
Four Singapore residents were arrested yesterday and
accused of being part of a syndicate that imported and sold
counterfeit electronics, the ChannelNewsAsia.com Web site
reported. 
Officers in the intellectual property rights branch of
Singapore&#8217;s Criminal Investigation Department seized more than
15,000 fake electronic items, mainly mobile phones, with an
estimated value of $3.7 million Singapore dollars ($2.7
million), according to the news Web site. 
The mobile phones were copies of well-known brands, and
were shipped from overseas, ChannelNewsAsia.com reported. 
This was the largest seizure of fake electronic goods in
three years, according to the news Web site. 
Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Livermore Lab Didn&#8217;t Take Nanotech Trade Secret, Jury Finds 
Lawrence Livermore National Security, operator of the U.S.
Energy Department&#8217;s Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, didn&#8217;t steal
trade secrets from a Bay Area inventor, a jury in California&#8217;s
Alameda County Superior Court said April 6. 
The jury rejected claims by Victor B. Kley and Berkeley,
California-based General Nanotechnology LLC that the lab stole a
nanotechnology process for the invention of a diamond capsule. 
The jury found that the lab officials and scientists were
researching design of nanodiamond capsules years before they
were aware of Kley&#8217;s design, the lab&#8217;s lawyers said in a
statement. The capsules are used in fusion experiments. 
Kley sued the lab management in California state court in
April 2008, alleging his technology was misappropriated and a
non-disclosure agreement was violated. He is a named inventor on
65 issued patents, according to the database of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office. 
The Livermore, California-based law was represented by
Patrick Michael, Dean Morehous and Nicole Norris of Chicago&#8217;s
Winston  Strawn LLP. 
The case is General Nanotechnology LLC v. Lawrence
Livermore National Security LLC, VG08384523, California Superior
Court, Alameda County.

Jersey-based financial adviser group said in a statement. 
Dansky joins from the Brattle Group where he was a
principle, with IP valuation and damages his area of expertise.

Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, reported third-quarter revenue that
missed analysts&#8217; most optimistic predictions, a sign that
corporate customers may be putting off computer buying. 
Sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, compared with
analysts&#8217; estimates that were as high as $14.8 billion for the
quarter that ended March 31. Shares fell in late trading. 
While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding purchases of new machines and long-term
contracts. Investors held out for added evidence of a spending
resurgence after chipmaker Intel Corp. last week forecast rising
sales this quarter and record profit margins for 2010. 
&#8220;Expectations were for more, given the strength we&#8217;ve seen
in PC sales,&#8221; Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest
Securities, said in an interview from Portland, Oregon. He rates
the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and said he doesn&#8217;t own them. 
Microsoft fell $1.02, or 3.3 percent, to $30.37 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock
fell 3.9 percent last quarter, while the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500
Index rose 4.9 percent. 
Third-quarter net income rose 35 percent to $4.01 billion,
or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast of 42 cents in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded the $14.4 billion
average in the survey, reflecting rising demand for Windows 7,
the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship operating system. 
Putting Off Orders 
Still, some companies are reluctant to place orders that
stretch over years. Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was
$12.8 billion, according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. In January, Microsoft reported second-quarter
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates by 15 cents. 
&#8220;The deferred revenue was lower than expected, suggesting
that enterprise spending is still just beginning to recover,&#8221;
said Sarah Friar, a San Francisco-based analyst for Goldman
Sachs Group who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Microsoft. &#8220;Enterprise
spending is still making its way out of the downturn.&#8221; 
Microsoft said operating expenses for the year ending June
30 will be $26.1 billion to $26.3 billion, compared with a
January prediction of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. Microsoft
no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. 
Mixed Bag 
&#8220;Consumer demand is still strong, but we also saw for the
first time growth in business hardware spending,&#8221; said Peter
Klein, Microsoft&#8217;s chief financial officer, in an interview.
Yet, it&#8217;s still taking longer to close multiyear deals. The
company did have growth in billings for multiyear agreements, he
said. &#8220;We are starting to fill that pipeline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
think it will resolve itself over time.&#8221; 
In the third quarter a year ago, net income was $2.98
billion, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $13.6 billion. 
Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. Intel, the world&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, last week indicated that recovery may be gathering
steam with a forecast for rising sales this quarter. 
&#8220;People had thought there would be closer correlation
between what Intel said about PC demand and PC outlook&#8221; and
Microsoft&#8217;s results, said Sasa Zorovic, a Boston-based
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem to
be the case.&#8221; He rates the shares &#8220;neutral.&#8221; 
Office 
Still, International Business Machines Corp. reported a
drop in services signings, showing corporate spending on larger
technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Microsoft Business Division revenue, mostly from Office
productivity software, fell 5.9 percent to $4.24 billion as some
customers held off purchases before Microsoft begins rolling out
a new version next month. Server software sales were $3.58
billion, missing estimates from Goldman Sachs and UBS AG. 
While sales of server computers have started to recover, it
will take longer for sales of Microsoft&#8217;s related software to
come back, Microsoft&#8217;s Klein said. 
Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. Personal-computer shipments rose
27 percent last quarter, according to Gartner Inc. The PC market
bounced back from the year-earlier period, when the recession
dragged down shipments almost 7 percent -- the worst performance
since 2001, according to market research firm IDC. 
Business, Bing 
Revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division was reduced as the
company deferred some sales to a future quarter. The company
gave customers who have purchased older versions of Office the
right to upgrade to the new version, Office 2010, which is
available to businesses next month. It hits stores in June. 
Online advertising revenue rose 19 percent as search and
graphical display ad markets recovered, Klein said.&#160;Sales in the
company&#8217;s online business rose 11.6 percent to $566 million. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine has increased the company&#8217;s
share of searches by 3.7 percentage points since Microsoft
overhauled the product in June, according to research firm
ComScore Inc. Microsoft had 11.7 percent of the U.S. search
market in March, compared with 65.1 percent for Google Inc. and
16.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc., according to ComScore.

While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer purchases of personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding spending on new machines and contracts
with the Redmond, Washington-based software maker. Customers may
also be refraining from deals that stretch over multiple years. 
&#8220;Investors have been looking for reasons to sell stocks,
even when the results are good,&#8221; Todd Lowenstein,
a fund manager for Highmark Capital Management, said in an
interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;They needed to deliver
near-perfect execution.&#8221; 
Microsoft fell $1.40, or 4.5 percent, to $29.99 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock

no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. 
Last Quarter&#8217;s Performance 
A year earlier, net income was $2.98 billion, or 33 cents a
share, on sales of $13.6 billion. Net income in that period
included severance costs and impairments to investments. 
In the second quarter, Microsoft beat analysts&#8217; estimates
for profit by 15 cents a year. Yet the company raised investors&#8217;
concerns by saying that gains were fueled by consumer demand as
business demand remained sluggish. Shares fell the day after the
report. 
Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, last week
indicated that recovery may be gathering steam with a forecast
for rising sales this quarter. 
Intel&#8217;s View 
Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini told analysts
corporate executives are starting to replace aging machines.
Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. 
Still, International Business Machines Corp. shares dropped
yesterday after the company reported a drop in services
signings, showing corporate spending on larger technology
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;It will be a gradual business cycle -- it&#8217;s not something
that happens in a single quarter,&#8221; Parakh said. &#8220;It will be
something that that goes on for a year or two, but it&#8217;s
important because Microsoft gets significant uplift from the
business versions of Windows.&#8221; 
PC Shipments 
Personal-computer shipments rose 27 percent last quarter,
according to Gartner Inc. That topped Gartner&#8217;s prediction of a
22 percent rise. The PC market bounced back from the year-
earlier period, when the recession dragged down shipments almost
7 percent -- the worst performance since 2001, according to
market research firm IDC.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and five past and present
executives will testify with Fabrice Tourre, the banker at the
center of U.S. fraud allegations, at a Senate hearing next week. 
Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Chief Risk Officer
Craig Broderick, former mortgage department head Daniel Sparks,
and current and former structured products group managing
directors Michael Swenson and Joshua Birnbaum were listed as
witnesses for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
hearing on April 27. The hearing will explore the role of
investment banks in the financial crisis, the panel said today
in an e-mail release. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
and Tourre, 31, last week, claiming they misled investors in a
collateralized debt obligation. Tourre and Blankfein agreed to
speak publicly to show Goldman Sachs has nothing to hide, people
with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Tourre plans to
tell the panel he did nothing wrong, one person said. 
Regulators claim that Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
firm in Wall Street history, misled investors by failing to
disclose that Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by billionaire
John Paulson, helped select loans for the CDO and then bet
against them. Goldman Sachs, which is contesting the SEC&#8217;s
claims, has said it &#8220;will take all necessary steps to defend
the firm.&#8221;

General Electric Co., the world&#8217;s
second-biggest maker of wind turbines, plans to introduce a 4
megawatt gearless wind turbine for offshore use in 2012 in a
challenge to market leader Siemens AG of Germany. 
Government incentives and pricing pressure for onshore
models amid the economic slowdown make the offshore market more
attractive, Mete Maltepe, global sales leader for wind energy at
GE, said in a telephone interview on April 20. 
Customer feedback on the offshore turbine has so far been
positive, Maltepe said. GE is using technology acquired in its
August takeover of the ScanWind unit of Morphic Technologies AB
in Sweden to take on Siemens and Vestas Wind Systems A/S of
Denmark. The purchase marked a change in tack for the U.S.
company, which has mostly focused on the onshore market. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a good turbine, the direct drive is key,&#8221; Maltepe
said. In the onshore segment, &#8220;there are notable headwinds in
pricing. We are reducing costs and improving the performance.
There is pressure on margins and we&#8217;ll have to see if we can
hold them up.&#8221; 
GE, with a 12.4 percent share of the overall on- and
offshore wind turbine market by capacity, is head to head with
Vestas, which in 2009 held the top spot at 12.5 percent,
according to Danish consultants BTM Consult APS. 
Cheaper to Run 
Munich-based Siemens, with 5.9 percent of the overall
market and the top spot in offshore models, is installing as
many as 10 of its new gearless 3 megawatt turbines for both
offshore and onshore use this year, with large-scale production
planned to start in 2011. Vestas CEO Ditlev Engel on Feb. 10
declined to say if his company also plans to develop a gearless
turbine. 
Direct drive or gearless turbines reduce the number of
moving parts in a unit and increase reliability, helping
minimize costly open-sea maintenance. Such technology accounted
for about 14 percent of installed capacity last year, BTM said.
Offshore wind park operators include Germany&#8217;s Enercon GmbH and
Xinjiang Goldwind Science  Technology Co. of China. 
GE has an installed base of 13,500 wind turbines, and its
wind energy business posted sales of more than $6 billion in
2009. 
&#8220;We are getting into offshore to be among the leading
suppliers,&#8221; Malpete said, declining to provide a specific time
frame.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director
Rajat Gupta is suspected by U.S. investigators of tipping off a
hedge fund billionaire to a $5 billion investment in the bank by
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a person with direct
knowledge of the inquiry said. 
Gupta, 61, who has said he won&#8217;t stand for re-election to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board, told Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam
about Buffett&#8217;s plan before it was announced in September 2008,
the person said, declining to be identified because the inquiry
isn&#8217;t public. 
Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is fighting criminal
charges and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil claims
that he used inside information to trade shares of companies
including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In a March 22 letter to
Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers, made public April 9, prosecutors said they
had an interest in his trading in Goldman Sachs stock in 2008.
Three days before the letter was sent, Goldman Sachs announced
Gupta was leaving its board. 
&#8220;Rajat has neither violated any law nor done anything else
improper,&#8221; his attorney, Gary Naftalis of Kramer, Levin,
Naftalis  Frankel LLP, said in a statement. &#8220;He has always
conducted himself with integrity in his business, philanthropic
and personal life.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson, SEC spokesman John
Nester and Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, declined to comment. 
Gupta hasn&#8217;t been formally accused of any wrongdoing. The
Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier today. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, agreed to sell $5 billion in preferred shares that paid
10 percent interest to Buffett, after the Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. bankruptcy and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s purchase of
Merrill Lynch  Co. 
Gupta was McKinsey&#8217;s worldwide chief from 1994 to 2003, and
a senior worldwide partner until 2007. He withdrew from the
consulting firm and joined the boards of American Airlines
parent AMR Corp., Procter  Gamble Co., Harman International
Industries Inc. Genpact Ltd., the business outsourcing company,
and Russia&#8217;s OAO Sberbank.

Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., sliced another $1
million off the asking price of his Chicago mansion. 
Going into its fourth year on the market, the Gold Coast
neighborhood property is now listed for $9.5 million, according
to the Web site of broker Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty.
It was previously listed for $10.5 million by Koenig  Strey
GMAC Real Estate. 
Dimon bought the house at 25 E. Banks St. in 2000 when he
headed Chicago-based Bank One Corp. The 15,000 square-foot
mansion has eight bedrooms, nine full bathrooms and was built in
the late 1800s. Dimon first listed it for sale in April 2007 for
$13.5 million. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a statement home,&#8221; said Jim Kinney, vice president
of luxury sales for Baird  Warner, a residential brokerage in
Chicago. &#8220;It represents an attractive value in the
neighborhood.&#8221; 
The house, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has a
rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city&#8217;s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast. 
Sluggish Market 
The problem is that demand for Chicago&#8217;s high-end homes is
&#8220;sluggish, sluggish, sluggish,&#8221; Kinney said, even though
overall sales in the nation&#8217;s third-largest city climbed 50
percent to 1,814 in March. 
The median price fell 4.6 percent to $209,000 from a year
earlier, the Illinois Association of Realtors said in a
statement yesterday. 
&#8220;While there has been some improvement in delinquencies
and home prices in some markets, we believe that significant
improvements will depend largely on an improving economy,&#8221;
Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. 
Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. 
Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale of Bank One to JPMorgan
Chase in 2004. He and his wife Judith bought the Banks Street
property in 2000 for $4.7 million, according to records on the
Web site of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds.

Honest Tea, partly owned by Coca-
Cola Co., may increase sales by at least 70 percent within a
year as it becomes available throughout the U.S., said Seth
Goldman, the tea maker&#8217;s co-founder and president. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the soda maker&#8217;s largest
bottler, and the majority of franchise distributors have
committed to the expansion, which includes some Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. locations, Goldman said today in an interview in Atlanta. 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a ship leaving the port, now you&#8217;ve got a
turbo-charged engine,&#8221; Goldman said of the national
distribution. Honest Tea sold about 5 million cases last year,
for revenue of $47 million, he said. 
Coca-Cola bought a 40 percent stake in Bethesda, Maryland-
based Honest Tea in 2008 to tap into demand for healthier
beverages amid soft-drink volume sales declines. The company has
also invested in Innocent Drinks, a maker of fruit smoothies,
and coconut-water maker Zico Beverages LLC. 
Honest Tea, which produces U.S. Department of Agriculture-
certified organic teas, lemonades and children&#8217;s drinks, sold
the stake to get capital and access to the world&#8217;s largest
beverage distribution system. 
Coca-Cola bottlers distribute Honest Tea in the western and
northeastern U.S., and CVS Caremark Corp. recently agreed to
sell four flavors in its stores nationally, Goldman said. The
national expansion by Coca-Cola this year won&#8217;t include New York
and some Mid-Atlantic markets, where Honest Tea will keep its
existing independent distributors, he said. 
Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola,
said the company looks forward to supporting Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;work in
building the Honest Tea brand,&#8221; declining to elaborate.
Officials at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment. 
Coca-Cola helped finance a $1 million tea brewer at one of
its bottling plants to process Honest Tea, which steeps tea
leaves in hot water rather than mixing a manufactured powder,
Goldman said. 
Coca-Cola fell 43 cents to $53.88 at 4:07 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped 5.5
percent this year.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit and Altana
AG won a jury verdict on the validity of their patent for the
heartburn drug Protonix. 
A federal jury in Newark, New Jersey, today rejected
arguments by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. that the patent covered an
obvious variation of earlier patented compounds in the same
family as Protonix. 
Teva and Sun conceded they infringed the patent, which left
the jury with only the question of whether the patent was issued
properly. Teva, in a statement, said it can make additional
invalidity arguments to U.S. District Judge Jose Linares and a
decision &#8220;independent of today&#8217;s jury verdict would be
sufficient to invalidate the patent.&#8221; 
Pfizer can now ask Linares to order Teva and Sun to stop
selling the drug until the patent expires in January. A second
trial would be held to determine what New York-based Pfizer
should be paid for profit lost since Teva and Sun began selling
cheaper versions of the drug two years ago. 
&#8220;If we are successful at the end of this process, we will
be seeking the full measure of our damages,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
spokesman for Pfizer, said in an interview. 
Reflux Disease 
Protonix, whose chemical name is pantoprazole sodium, is a
proton pump inhibitor that reduces the secretion of stomach
acids and is used to treat the effects of gastroesophageal
reflux disease, or GERD, which cases heartburn and chronic
ulcers in the esophagus. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, acquired Protonix
last year as part of its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth. 
Protonix sales reached $1.9 billion in 2007, and then fell
58 percent to $806 million in 2008, after Teva, based in Petah
Tikva, Israel, began selling its generic version. Mumbai-based
Sun entered the market in January 2008, a month after Teva. 
Not all of the generic sales went to those two companies.
Wyeth began selling Protonix under its chemical name as a so-
called authorized generic to challenge Teva and Sun sales. 
The patent, licensed to Wyeth, is owned by Altana&#8217;s
pharmaceutical business, which was bought by closely held
Nycomed Danmark ApS. AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s Prilosec was the first
proton pump inhibitor. Others include AstraZeneca&#8217;s Nexium,
Novartis AG&#8217;s Prevacid and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Aciphex. 
Lawsuit Pending 
The U.S. and 16 states have a pending lawsuit claiming
Wyeth manipulated prices of the heartburn pill to increase
market share and defraud Medicare, the U.S. government health-
insurance program for the elderly. A judge in February denied
Pfizer&#8217;s request to dismiss the suit. 
Wholesale drug distributors also have sued Wyeth and
Altana, accusing them of misleading the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to obtain the patent and protect their monopoly
on Protonix. That case was put on hold until the patent case was
completed. 
The case is Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
Inc., 04cv2355, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark).

Morgan Stanley, the world&#8217;s largest
brokerage, will probably close 120 additional U.S. offices to
eliminate overlapping locations in its joint venture with
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Smith Barney. 
U.S. outlets will shrink to around 750, the unit&#8217;s
president, Charles Johnston, said today in an interview at an
industry conference in New York. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney had
870 domestic locations as of March 31, down from 958 on June 30,
2009. The timing of some decisions will be driven by the
branches&#8217; leases, which are often 10-year terms, Johnston said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s overlap in just about every market in the country
between Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley offices,&#8221; Johnston
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no grand plan to dramatically shrink the
footprint, but there&#8217;s an awful lot of no-brainer decisions when
you do a deal like this.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global wealth-management unit reported
pretax income of $278 million for the first quarter, compared
with $119 million in same period a year earlier, before the
joint venture was completed. Chief Executive Officer James
Gorman, who led the unit before succeeding John Mack in January,
said in a letter to shareholders earlier this month that the
joint venture will play &#8220;an increasingly important role in our
growth and profitability.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will look to expand outside the
U.S. because those markets are set to grow faster, Johnston
said. 
&#8216;Organic Growth&#8217; 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a large enough footprint in those
markets,&#8221; Johnston said. &#8220;We&#8217;d like it to be bigger, and
there&#8217;s only two ways to do that -- you can buy something or you
can grow organically. There hasn&#8217;t been much that&#8217;s been
available to buy. We&#8217;ve talked about some deals, but we&#8217;re going
on the path of organic growth.&#8221; 
The unit had 18,140 advisers as of March 31 as turnover was
at &#8220;historic lows,&#8221; Johnston said. He said the number of
advisers will likely stay around 18,000 and revenue growth will
come from increases in adviser productivity. 
The wealth-management unit had $3.11 billion in revenue,
down from $3.14 billion in the fourth quarter. The brokerage&#8217;s
pretax profit margin was 9 percent, up from 7 percent in the
fourth quarter. Gorman has said the firm expects to increase
that margin to 15 percent by the end of this year and more than
20 percent by the end of 2011. Net new client assets in the unit
were $5.8 billion, the highest since the third quarter of 2008.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may be
better off cutting its losses instead of fighting what it terms
&#8220;unfounded&#8221; fraud claims, say professors of securities law who
have examined the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
lawsuit against the bank. 
The most profitable firm in Wall Street history will
probably lose what is typically the first hurdle in court, a
motion to throw out the April 16 suit because it lacks legal
merit, the professors said in interviews this week. After that,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s risks will mount and its negotiating position
will weaken, they said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a very low probability that Goldman could get the
case dismissed,&#8221; said Thomas Hazen of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose books include a two-volume
treatise on broker-dealer law. &#8220;Every pretrial motion the SEC
wins, Goldman gets one step closer to losing.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs is the first major Wall Street firm accused
by regulators of fraud connected to the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market. The SEC&#8217;s allegation that Goldman Sachs
defrauded investors sparked a 13 percent, one-day decline in its
shares. The New York-based firm, led by Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, 55, said it will vigorously contest the claims.
It must weigh the risks of a drawn-out legal battle against the
benefits of a more immediate resolution.

Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.
fell after releasing earnings reports that showed a rebound in
technology spending by companies and online buying by consumers
is less robust than analysts had predicted. 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, said third-
quarter sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, missing the
most optimistic revenue estimates. Amazon.com, the biggest
online retailer, said operating income this quarter may be as
low as $220 million, compared with $322.2 million, the average
prediction of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
While Microsoft and Amazon.com had rising sales and profit
last quarter, neither lived up to analysts&#8217; most bullish
predictions. Optimism rose last week after Intel Corp. forecast
record profit margins in 2010, indicating that a revival in
computer demand is gathering steam. Results from Apple Inc. and
Best Buy Co. this week reflected robust consumer purchasing. 
&#8220;With technology in general and Microsoft in particular,
you&#8217;re going to get this issue where it&#8217;s not good enough or
it&#8217;s already in the stock and it sells off a little bit,&#8221; said
Dave Stepherson, a fund manager at Hardesty Capital Management
in Baltimore. Hardesty manages $700 million in assets, including
Microsoft shares. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had a lot of momentum in technology
stocks.&#8221; 
Shares Decline 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 3.6 percent
to $30.27 in extended trading after the report. The shares had
risen 6 cents to $31.39 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.
Amazon.com, based in Seattle, dropped 5.9 percent to $141.30
after closing at $150.09. 
Amazon stock traded in Germany fell 4.9 percent to $142.70
as of 10:09 a.m. in Frankfurt, while Microsoft declined 3.2
percent to $30.40 from yesterday&#8217;s Nasdaq closing price of
$31.39. 
Third-quarter net income at Microsoft rose 35 percent to
$4.01 billion, or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast
of 42 cents in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded
the $14.4 billion average in the survey, reflecting rising
demand for Windows 7, the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship
operating system. 
Still, investors were expecting more, Stepherson said. For
the second straight quarter, much of Microsoft&#8217;s strength came
from consumers, while business spending hasn&#8217;t rebounded with
vigor. Sales of Office and server software missed estimates at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG. 
Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear contracts, was
$12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was $12.8 billion,
according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at Jefferies  Co. 
The numbers suggest corporate customers are holding off on
big orders that stretch over many years. 
&#8216;Really Poor&#8217; 
&#8220;The deferred revenue was really poor,&#8221; said Brent Thill,
an analyst with UBS AG in San Francisco. &#8220;Microsoft is one of
the last companies in technology to say enterprise spending is
turning. Everyone thought they&#8217;d put up better growth.&#8221; 
Amazon.com said operating income will be $220 million to
$320 million, below the average estimate in the Bloomberg
survey. The company is struggling to extract favorable pricing
from its suppliers who, with improving demand, don&#8217;t have to
offer as many discounts, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Financial LP in New York. 
As more consumers snap up digital books and other media --
buying fewer of the physical products that have long been
Amazon.com&#8217;s mainstay -- the company faces increased competition
from rivals such as Apple, Gillis said. 
&#8220;Amazon is not likely to experience the same
profitability and leadership position in digital media that it
enjoys selling physical books, movies and music,&#8221; Gillis said. 
Earlier Gains 
First-quarter sales of $7.13 billion and profit of $299
million, or 66 cents a share, beat analysts&#8217; estimates. The
company&#8217;s shares have climbed 90 percent in the past year,
double the gain by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
Amazon.com and Microsoft are not the only companies whose
quarterly earnings reports compared poorly to those of Intel and
Apple. Google Inc., the biggest seller of Internet advertising,
posted its biggest drop since December 2008 last week after
reporting profit that missed the highest analyst estimates.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The leading Internet stocks so far all reported fairly
good results and guidance and still saw their stocks drop,&#8221;
said Fred Moran, an analyst at Benchmark Co. in Boca Raton,
Florida. &#8220;The stock market expectations for where technology
stocks should trade may have temporarily gotten ahead of
themselves.&#8221;

investment; investigators wrote to Gupta, who said last month
he was stepping down as a Goldman director, to say they had
found out about the tip through an intercepted phone call
between Gupta and Rajaratnam, the newspaper said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and U.S.
Senator Carl Levin fired opening shots ahead of a congressional
hearing this week, releasing conflicting evidence of the
investment bank&#8217;s tactics during the mortgage market&#8217;s collapse. 
Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, posted internal Goldman Sachs e-
mails on his website yesterday that he said show the firm &#8220;made
a lot of money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Goldman
Sachs responded with documents indicating the firm lost money on
mortgages in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market
would fall. 
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
current and former Goldman Sachs employees will have to face
questions from Levin&#8217;s panel against the backdrop of fraud
claims from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
regulator sued the firm on April 16, saying it defrauded
investors when selling a debt instrument tied to mortgages. 
Goldman Sachs, which contests the SEC&#8217;s claims, said
Levin&#8217;s committee has &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; evidence and jumped to
conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
&#8220;Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not simply
market-makers, they were self-interested promoters of risky and
complicated financial schemes that helped trigger the crisis,&#8221;
Levin, 75, said in a statement released with the e-mails. 
One of the e-mails provided by Levin yesterday shows
Blankfein telling colleagues on Nov. 18, 2007, that the firm was
making more money from its so-called short bets on mortgages
than it lost on its investments related to home loans. 
&#8216;Mortgage Mess&#8217; 
&#8220;Of course we didn&#8217;t dodge the mortgage mess,&#8221; Blankfein
wrote in an e-mail dated Nov. 18, 2007, that was among eight
pages of documents made public by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &#8220;We lost money, then made more
than we lost because of shorts. Also, it&#8217;s not over, so who
knows how it will turn out ultimately.&#8221; 
Another document contains an exchange between Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar and Gary Cohn, the firm&#8217;s
president and chief operating officer, about the fixed-income
division&#8217;s profit and loss statement in July 2007. Cohn&#8217;s e-mail
describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage unit is up &#8220;in the index
book,&#8221; while recording writedowns on residential mortgages and
collateralized debt obligations. One method the firm used to
make bets against the mortgage market was to take short
positions on the so-called ABX index. 
&#8220;Tells you what might be happening to people who don&#8217;t
have the big short,&#8221; Viniar replies, according to the
documents. 
Losses Overwhelmed Gains 
Documents released yesterday by Goldman Sachs show that the
firm&#8217;s gains from shorting subprime mortgages in 2007 were
overwhelmed by losses in 2008 when higher-quality mortgages
suffered more than the firm anticipated. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs did not have access to any special
information that caused us to know that the U.S. housing market
would collapse,&#8221; the firm stated in an &#8220;executive summary&#8221; of
its arguments released yesterday. &#8220;As a result of the spread of
the crisis from subprime to all residential mortgages, Goldman
Sachs had overall net losses of approximately $1.7 billion with
respect to residential mortgage-related products for fiscal
2008.&#8221; 
A lawyer for Goldman Sachs wrote a letter to Levin April 23
asking the subcommittee to warn the firm of any information the
panel plans to release so it has a chance to respond. The letter
followed Levin&#8217;s statement at a hearing the same day that
&#8220;investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not market makers
helping clients; they were self-interested promoters of risky
and complicated financial schemes that were a major part of the
2008 crisis.&#8221; 
&#8216;Already Drawn Conclusions&#8217; 
&#8220;The statement suggests that you and the subcommittee have
already drawn conclusions about the conduct of Goldman Sachs,&#8221;
K. Lee Blalack II from the law firm O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP wrote
to Levin. &#8220;We strongly disagree with your statement at today&#8217;s
hearing and believe that, if we were provided an opportunity to
respond to your specific findings, Goldman Sachs could produce
to you information that establishes that your findings are
incorrect.&#8221; 
Blalack, a partner in the Washington office of O&#8217;Melveny 
Myers, is a former chief counsel and staff director of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, according to his
biography on the firm&#8217;s website. 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Making Markets 
Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. 
&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; 
Pecora Commission 
The Senate investigation into the causes of the Wall Street
crash of 1929 became known as the Pecora Commission, after the
former New York City assistant district attorney who was
appointed its chief counsel. Congress went on to pass the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre,
are accused of violating in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s suit filed on April 16. 
The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., led by billionaire John Paulson, played a
role in choosing the mortgage securities that underpinned the
CDO and planned to bet on its failure. 
Goldman Sachs said it would never mislead investors and
that ACA Management LLC and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
investors in the deal, had all the material information they
needed. Tourre will tell Levin&#8217;s panel he did nothing wrong,
according to a person briefed on his planned testimony. 
SEC Enforcement Chief 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Wall Street Journal reported April 23, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear
whether Khuzami reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related
to CDOs, the newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because
the terms of his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing
Deutsche Bank, John Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg
News. 
Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings may have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. 
Tougher Questioning 
Blankfein may get tougher questioning than he received in
front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by former
California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January, Geisst
said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. 
&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; 
Levin has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. 
&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; 
Blum said the permanent subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels in which senators and their staffs cooperate across
party lines. 
Parade of Critics 
Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; 
Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. 
A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. 
Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at the
permanent subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. 
Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. 
Budget Watchdog 
Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; 
Created in 1948, the panel was led in the 1950s by then-
Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who alleged that
communists had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy
later was censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003
&#8220;destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the
infiltration of our government.&#8221; 
In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. 
Enron, Saddam Hussein 
Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. 
The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. 
In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. 
The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221;

Assicurazioni Generali SpA, the
largest Italian insurer, named Cesare Geronzi, the outgoing
chairman of its largest shareholder, Mediobanca SpA, as its new
chairman and Giovanni Perissinotto as its sole Chief Executive. 
Geronzi, 75, replaces 85-year-old Antoine Bernheim, who was
named honorary president at Generali&#8217;s annual meeting yesterday
in Trieste, Italy. Perissinotto&#8217;s former co-CEO, Sergio
Balbinot, now will lead the company&#8217;s international insurance
units. 
&#8220;We expect the effect of the Geronzi&#8217;s appointment to be
negative for the shares,&#8221; Fabrizio Croce, a Zurich-based
analyst with Kepler Capital Markets SA with a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on
the stock, wrote in a note April 23. &#8220;Investment funds, Anglo-
Saxon investors and ethical funds could have a potential issue
with the appointment and may reduce their positions.&#8221; 
Some investors are concerned with the influence Milan-based
Mediobanca, Italy&#8217;s biggest investment bank, has over the
insurer. Geronzi yesterday said Generali doesn&#8217;t plan a capital
increase, which might dilute Mediobanca&#8217;s 14 percent stake. He
also ruled out a merger with Mediobanca. 
Still, the decision to make Perissinotto, 56, the company&#8217;s
single chief executive &#8220;will satisfy investors worried by
Mediobanca&#8217;s strength on the board,&#8221; Edoardo Liuni an analyst
at NuovoMercato.it said in a phone interview after the
appointments. &#8220;Perissinotto will ensure independent leadership
at the insurer.&#8221; 
&#8216;Punished&#8217; 
Bernheim, who was chairman for eight years, said he
regretted Mediobanca&#8217;s decision to replace him. 
&#8220;Sometimes when you work well, you are punished,&#8221; said
Bernheim, who has spent almost four decades with the company.
&#8220;This is an example.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t elaborate the comment. 
Geronzi, speaking at a press conference after the annual
meeting, said that Bernheim&#8217;s words were understandable given
his long tenure at the insurer. &#8220;I appreciate Bernheim, as
witnessed by his appointment as honorary president,&#8221; he said. 
Bernheim was moved to tears several times during his one-
and-a-half hour speech that was translated from French. He said
he wished &#8220;all the best&#8221; to the new management. 
Geronzi was reinstated as chairman of Mediobanca by
investors in 2007 after a conviction in connection with the
bankruptcy of property and tourism company Italcase. He was
acquitted of the charges in 2009 on appeal. Geronzi, who won&#8217;t
have an executive role at Generali, was also formerly a Bank of
Italy official and chairman of Rome-based Capitalia SpA. 
Nagel, Caltagirone, Bollore 
Generali appointed non-executive deputy chairmen at the
annual meeting: Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel; Francesco Gaetano
Caltagirone, the chairman of publishing and media company
Caltagirone Editore Spa; and French billionaire Vincent Bollore. 
Enel SpA CEO Paolo Scaroni, Banco Espanol de Credito SA
Chairwoman Ana Patricia Botin, Tod&#8217;s SpA Chairman Diego della
Valle, and De Agostini SpA CEO Lorenzo Pellicioli also were
named board members. 
Generali said first-quarter gross premiums rose 16 percent,
boosted by its life-insurance business and a recovery of Italian
operations. 
Total premiums increased to 20.8 billion euros ($27.8
billion) in the first three months of 2010 from the year
earlier, Perissinotto said. Italian premiums rose 22 percent to
5.4 billion euros because of a 34 percent increase in life-
insurance business. 
&#8220;We have seen positive elements in the first quarter,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We hope for a consolidation of the economic recovery
that would allow us to increase our profitability.&#8221; 
Greece, Spain, Ireland 
Generali has declined 11 percent this year, compared with
the 2.2 percent increase in the Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance
Index. The company has a market value of 26 billion euros. 
Generali has 900 million euros of &#8220;exposure&#8221; to Greece,
Spain, Portugal and Ireland, the company said yesterday. 
Generali, which will release its first-quarter results on
May 12, is expanding in emerging markets, including China and
the Middle East, as it recovers from the economic crisis.
Perissinotto said that the external growth is a priority for
Generali. 
The insurer wants to increase its business in Russia, where
it owns a 38.5 percent holding in Ingosstrakh. Perissinotto said
he aims to resume talks with Oleg Deripaska, who owns the
remainder, about raising the stake. 
Generali doesn&#8217;t plan to boost its stake in Banco Santander
SA, Perissinotto said.

Wall Street&#8217;s smartest will meet
the Senate&#8217;s toughest at a hearing next week that could provide
a seminal moment in the reckoning after the financial crisis. 
Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, and six current and former employees of
his firm will face a grilling from the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Led by Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has
served in the U.S. Senate for more than 30 years, the panel has
a reputation for thorough research. 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. It comes after
regulators sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre,
alleging fraud in the sale of a mortgage-linked investment as
the market for such investments turned, accusations the firm
denies. 
&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; 
The Senate investigation into the causes of the Wall Street
crash of 1929 became known as the Pecora Commission, after the
former New York City assistant district attorney who was
appointed its chief counsel. Congress went on to pass the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and Tourre are accused of
violating in the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit filed
on April 16. 
SEC Accusations 
The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., led by billionaire John Paulson, played a
role in choosing the mortgage securities that underpinned the
CDO and planned to bet on its failure. 
Goldman Sachs said it would never mislead investors and
that ACA Management LLC and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
investors in the deal, had all the material information they
needed. Tourre will tell the panel he did nothing wrong,
according to a person briefed on his planned testimony. 
Levin today released Goldman Sachs e-mails obtained by his
committee that he said demonstrate the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Among them was
an e-mail in which Blankfein said, &#8220;We lost money, then made
more than we lost because of shorts.&#8221; 
&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
today released information on the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
profits and losses in 2007 and 2008. The information shows
Goldman Sachs had net losses of $1.2 billion in residential
mortgage-related products in the period. While the firm
generated more money than it lost on mortgage positions in 2007,
losses overwhelmed gains in the first quarter of 2008, the
documents show. 
&#8220;The U.S. Senate subcommittee has cherry-picked just four
e-mails from the almost 20 million pages of documents and e-
mails provided to it by Goldman Sachs,&#8221; van Praag said. &#8220;It is
concerning that the subcommittee seems to have reached its
conclusion even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
Implications for Regulation 
Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings could have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. 
Blankfein, 55, may get tougher questioning than he received
in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by
former California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January,
Geisst said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. 
&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; 
Levin, 75, has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. 
Homework Done 
&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; 
Blum said the Permanent Subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels with bipartisan cooperation between the senators and
their staffs. 
Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; 
Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. 
A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. 
&#8216;Lose-Lose&#8217; 
The hearing presents a &#8220;lose-lose situation&#8221; for Goldman
Sachs, Geisst said, because the firm is fighting a battle over
its reputation as well as the law. 
&#8220;If they answer with generalities and maintain that they
haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, then it just gets worse for them,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If they do admit that they&#8217;ve actually done something
wrong, specifically, it won&#8217;t go well for them.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Making Markets 
Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; 
&#8220;Some of these things Goldman did had no useful
function,&#8221; said Richard Sylla, a financial historian and
economics professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of
Business. &#8220;They have that problem even if they didn&#8217;t do
anything illegal.&#8221; 
Five Goldman Sachs senior executives sold $65.4 million of
stock after the firm received notice of possible fraud
allegations last year from the SEC, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment on the sales when contacted by Bloomberg
News. The firm has said it didn&#8217;t disclose receiving a Wells
notice from the SEC because it didn&#8217;t think it was material. 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Journal reported yesterday, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear whether Khuzami
reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related to CDOs, the
newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because the terms of
his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing Deutsche Bank, John
Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg News. 
Roach, Ashdown 
Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at
Permanent Subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. 
Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. 
Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; 
McCarthy Censure 
Created in 1948, the panel was led by then-Senator Joseph
McCarthy of Wisconsin in the 1950s, who alleged that communists
had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy later was
censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003 &#8220;destroyed
careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of
our government.&#8221; 
In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. 
Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. 
Focus on Taxes 
The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. 
In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. 
The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. 
Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221;

White House officials and Democratic
lawmakers, bracing for a Senate showdown on Wall Street
oversight, seized on internal e-mails from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to push for new curbs that would include a ban on
proprietary trading. 
&#8220;These e-mails signify that there are all kinds of
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that Wall Street is
working for its clients and working against its clients in the
same sort of bundled toxic securities,&#8221; Senator Sherrod Brown,
a Democrat from Ohio, said today on ABC&#8217;s This Week. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why we need really strong reform that will separate the
proprietary trading from banking functions.&#8221; 
The e-mails show that the New York-based firm &#8220;made a lot
of money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; said Carl
Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations and published the e-mails
yesterday. Democrats are using the revelations to bolster
support for Senator Christopher Dodd&#8217;s financial overhaul, which
faces a test vote in the Senate tomorrow. At least one
Republican vote is needed to open debate. 
A ban on proprietary trading, named the Volcker rule after
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker who&#8217;s advising the
President Barack Obama, is &#8220;highly relevant&#8221; to ending
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, Austan Goolsbee, a White
House economic adviser, said today on ABC&#8217;s program &#8220;This
Week.&#8221; 
Blankfein at Hearing 
Levin&#8217;s panel is scheduled to question Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six other current and former
Goldman Sachs employees on Tuesday. The firm is battling an
April 16 fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission that accused Goldman Sachs of misleading investors in
a collateralized debt obligation about the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. in assembling the deal and its intention to
bet against the CDO. 
Goldman Sachs has called the SEC suit &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; The firm responded to Levin&#8217;s publication of the e-
mails with documents indicating the firm lost money on mortgages
in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market would fall. 
&#8220;The CEO of Goldman Sachs is not going to win any
popularity contests, when over a period that ordinary Americans&#8217;
pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were
actually making significant money off of it,&#8221; Goolsbee said. 
The SEC&#8217;s case and the e-mails heighten the need to pass
regulatory reform, Dodd, who chairs the Senate Banking
Committee, said today in an interview on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the
Press.&#8221; Dodd has been working with Richard Shelby, the top
Republican on the committee, since last year to try to broker a
compromise on the legislation. 
Shelby and Dodd 
Shelby, also speaking on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221;, said that
while he and Dodd are &#8220;conceptually very, very close&#8221; on the
legislation, he doubts they will reach an agreement by tomorrow.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to end, once and for all, the casino atmosphere on
Wall Street,&#8221; he said. 
Larry Summers, the director of the White House National
Economic Council, said the e-mails underscore &#8220;what is at the
center&#8221; of Obama&#8217;s plan for overhauling financial regulation.
That includes &#8220;the importance of things being in the open,&#8221;
and of knowing &#8220;who&#8217;s got a stake in success, who&#8217;s got a stake
in failure,&#8221; Summers said on the CBS program &#8220;Face The
Nation.&#8221; 
Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and member of
the Senate Banking Committee who helped write parts of the bill,
said the e-mails &#8220;certainly do not read well.&#8221; 
&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; 
&#8220;I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed
in the e-mails, but I think we&#8217;re better off waiting to see
exactly what has taken place,&#8221; Corker said. &#8220;There are some
conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked
at, but I&#8217;d rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds
before making any judgments.&#8221; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a really uncomfortable week, a
challenging week, for CEO Lloyd Blankfein,&#8221; Jon Corzine, the
former Democratic New Jersey governor and senator who ran
Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, said in an interview broadcast
today on ABC News&#8217;s Good Morning America. &#8220;The silver lining is
this is going to reinforce the need for moving forward with
financial regulatory reform.&#8221;

Hunt</headline><body>
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose
exceptional cachet and clout have been enhanced by its role in
public policy, suddenly is a pariah in government and political
circles. 
Let&#8217;s assume, for a moment, that the company prevails in
the fraud suit brought by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, that no one was misled about the content of the
product it sold, only about the background. 
Also assume that, as Goldman Sachs executives insisted
last week, most of their customers are supportive of the firm,
and any short-term losses will be negligible. 
Still, the Goldman Sachs brand, one of the most
prestigious in the world, corporate or otherwise, is tarnished,
perhaps indelibly. If the company believes it can tough its way
through this, it&#8217;s as insular as critics charge. 
For starters, the fraud suit, which Goldman Sachs says is
without merit, may not be the only problem facing the company.
The Germans and British are already piling on, and reportedly
Goldman Sachs is nervous about the full-scale inquiry into the
Wall Street fiasco by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Getting in the cross hairs of the panel&#8217;s
Democratic chairman, Michigan&#8217;s Carl Levin, one of the
toughest, straightest shooters in Congress, is cause for
concern. 
Stellar Values 
For context, professionally I&#8217;ve known a half-dozen top
former Goldman Sachs executives; they&#8217;re all able and
thoughtful. The one I know well has stellar values. 
Also, despite working for two of the great financial news
organizations in the world for more than four decades, I&#8217;ve
never covered Wall Street; I cover politics, a proud
journalistic hack. 
In this case, the prism of politics is illuminating. The
global Goldman Sachs mystique has been enhanced by the number
of executives tapped for leading government jobs. Treasury
Secretaries Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and
Henry Paulson in the George W. Bush administration were former
Goldman Sachs chairmen, as was Stephen Friedman, the top White
House economic adviser during the Bush presidency. There is a
plethora of Goldman alums sprinkled throughout the Obama
administration. 
Until recently there was no better credential for
government service than a Goldman Sachs background; now the G
is more like the forbidden A in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;The
Scarlet Letter.&#8221; 
Lethal Background 
If there were an opening today for a Federal Reserve
governor or a deputy Treasury secretary or for a prominent
White House economic role, a Goldman Sachs background,
administration officials privately admit, would be lethal. 
&#8220;Clearly, they&#8217;ve become a toxic asset,&#8221; says Simon Johnson, a former International Monetary Fund economist who is
now a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management. 
The fraud charges were the final straw in the building
resentment against Goldman Sachs; synthetic collateralized debt
obligations aren&#8217;t the stuff of backyard barbecue chatter or
debates at a bar. The public and political resentment, as one
crisis manager put it, grows out of the sense that Goldman
Sachs not only hasn&#8217;t &#8220;shared the pain&#8221; experienced by the
rest of America, but has &#8220;profited from it.&#8221; (Goldman Sachs,
which reported record profit last week, did take a government
handout in 2008 and repaid it in full with interest). 
Political Giving 
In this environment, a firm&#8217;s political standing
dissipates. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s political-action committee gave
$290,500 to congressional candidates last month as the
legislature weighed the financial-regulation overhaul.
President Barack Obama shook the Goldman Sachs money tree for
almost $1 million in the last presidential campaign. 
There is now a bipartisan scramble to strike distance from
the Wall Street powerhouse. Mark Kirk, Republican candidate for
an Illinois U.S. Senate seat, says he&#8217;ll refund any
contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. His Democratic
opponents say that isn&#8217;t sufficient. 
In the Arkansas Senate Democratic primary, Lieutenant
Governor Bill Halter assailed incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln
for getting money from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s PAC. Lincoln just
canceled a plan to hold a fundraising lunch at Goldman. In the
California gubernatorial race, opponents are assailing former
EBay Inc. (EBAY) Chairwoman Meg Whitman for being an ex-Goldman Sachs
director. The Whitman camp&#8217;s response: Her critics have Goldman
ties, too. 
Keeping the Money 
Although Obama may be capitalizing on the anti-Wall Street
wave with his regulatory overhaul bill, Republicans such as
South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint are demanding he give back
the big bucks he got from Goldman Sachs in the last campaign;
he won&#8217;t. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, the guest of
honor at a private Park Avenue cocktails soiree for wealthy
Obama supporters last weekend, surely wasn&#8217;t pleased it was
reported that a Goldman Sachs partner was present. 
Whatever the legalities of the fraud charge, it looks
awful, more like the doings in a Las Vegas casino than on Wall
Street, and more like Gordon Gekko greed than the legitimate
economic interest to hedge against risk. Goldman Sachs contends
the SEC&#8217;s case boils down to the actions of Fabrice Tourre,
then a 28-year-old vice president, who while putting together
the multibillion-dollar deal was writing e-mails, according to
the SEC, exclaiming that the &#8220;whole building is about to
collapse,&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;surreal&#8221; that no one understands
these instruments. 
If he was the culprit, who was the enabler? 
Goldman Scapegoat 
With no inside knowledge, but based on years of watching
politicians and political institutions respond to such crises,
there are two certainties about what&#8217;s going on in the
corporate suites of Goldman Sachs. There is likely near-
universal consensus that much of this is unfair and the company
is being made a scapegoat by pandering politicians. 
The established order says we&#8217;re going to fight this with
all our considerable resources, while continuing to flourish
financially because we&#8217;re better. 
Deeper, however, there is another, more profound debate.
Others, perhaps privately, realize this is a fantasy. If there
is a way to settle the fraud case without risking huge
financial exposure, it has to be considered. Someone with Paul Volcker-like credibility has to be enlisted to review the
company&#8217;s culture and practices; contrition and change at the
top are unavoidable.

Newly disclosed Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. internal e-mails cast light on how the investment bank
devised collateralized debt obligations called Abacus, including
one at the center of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud lawsuit. 
The e-mails show employees discussed which outside firms
would be &#8220;easiest&#8221; to work with while creating Abacus CDOs to
bet against the housing market. 
The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin,
the Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, as the panel prepares to
question Goldman Sachs executives today. In one message, a
Goldman Sachs worker asked which outside firm would most likely
approve assets that hedge fund Paulson  Co. wanted to include
in a CDO and bet against. 
&#8220;The way I look at it, the easiest manager to work with
should be used for our own axes,&#8221; the author wrote in December
2006, using industry jargon that can refer to the firm&#8217;s 
financial interest in a deal. The writer also expressed concern 
that two firms being considered weren&#8217;t likely to sign off on 
Paulson&#8217;s suggested assets. &#8220;They will never agree to the type 
of names [P]aulson want to use[.]&#8221; 
The Senate committee&#8217;s investigators have pored through
about 2 million Goldman Sachs documents as lawmakers prepare to
question Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
other current and former employees. They include Fabrice Tourre,
the banker at the center of the SEC&#8217;s complaint. 
&#8216;Be Sensitive&#8217; 
In one e-mail, Tourre emphasized the firm should focus on
serving Paulson to reap greater profits. 
&#8220;We need to be sensitive of the profitability of these
trades vs. profitability of abacus,&#8221; Tourre wrote in one e-
mail, according to a copy released by Levin. &#8220;We should
prioritize the higher profit margin businesses with Paulson.&#8221; 
The e-mail about picking the easiest manager was part of an
exchange with Tourre, according to a list of exhibits released
by the lawmaker. The author wasn&#8217;t identified. 
In another December 2006 e-mail, Tourre discussed other
business opportunities for Abacus, outlining a strategy in which
Goldman Sachs would &#8220;&#8216;rent&#8217; our Abacus platform to
counterparties&#8221; that wanted to short the market. 
The messages show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its own
interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221;
Levin said. While his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for
determining whether there was any criminal activity, it will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the
SEC or the Justice Department. 
The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, claiming the New
York-based bank misled investors in a CDO about the role Paulson
played in assembling the deal and the fund&#8217;s intent to bet that
its underlying assets would lose value. The hedge fund, run by
billionaire investor John Paulson, wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs is fighting the SEC&#8217;s claims, which it says
are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; In prepared testimony for
today&#8217;s hearing, Blankfein said the firm didn&#8217;t bet against
clients and didn&#8217;t &#8220;make a massive short&#8221; against the housing
market.

The cost to protect the debt of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and two other derivatives dealers jumped for the fourth day as
the U.S. Senate considers a bill that may curb their trading
revenue. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs, the bank facing
fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, jumped to the highest in almost a year. Contracts on
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit reached
the highest since August, and JPMorgan swaps climbed the most in
more than 11 weeks. 
The legislation would damp one of Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable businesses, in which Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of
America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. earned an estimated
$28 billion in revenue last year, according to filings with the
Federal Reserve and people familiar with their income sources. 
The Senate was set to hold a test vote today on legislation
that would force the most actively traded derivatives to
exchanges or trading platforms that resemble exchanges, mandate
banks to hold more capital on other derivatives trades and
require commercial banks to wall off swaps trading desks. 
&#8220;You&#8217;re talking about a pretty significant contributor to
earnings,&#8221; said Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service in New York. &#8220;If they lost a material portion
of that, it obviously wouldn&#8217;t be good. The problem with
exchange trading for dealers is that they would be giving up
profits without a concomitant decrease in risk to compensate for
it.&#8221; 
Test Vote 
Senator Richard Shelby, a lead negotiator on the financial-
reform bill, said Republicans will block Democrats&#8217; efforts to
begin debate on the measure in a test vote today. 
The derivatives provisions are part of a broader financial-
regulation bill intended to prevent a repeat of the credit
crisis that led to the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
the near collapse of Bear Stearns Cos. and the government
bailout of insurer American International Group. 
The legislation includes measures empowering federal
agencies to dissolve failed systemically important financial
firms to prevent their collapse from disrupting the economy. 
JPMorgan alone could lose as much as $3 billion a year in
revenue if it doesn&#8217;t combat the move of derivatives trades to
exchanges, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a March 15 report. 
&#8220;The banking system is on a journey to being much more
utility-like,&#8221; Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive officer at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said today at the Milken
Global Institute conference in Los Angeles. &#8220;What&#8217;s likely to
happen over the next few months is much more emphasis on
stability and less emphasis on efficiency and innovation.&#8221; 
Hearing Tomorrow 
Five-year credit-default swaps on Goldman jumped 23 basis
points to 167 basis points as of 4:35 p.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. That&#8217;s the highest
since May 2009, CMA DataVision prices show. 
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is set
to question Goldman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former employees of the firm
tomorrow. The SEC says Goldman Sachs and executive director
Fabrice Tourre misled investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation about the role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co.,
which bet the CDO would collapse. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the panel, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. 
Goldman swaps have jumped 76 basis points since April 15,
the day before the SEC announced its fraud suit. 
Swaps on JPMorgan climbed 17 basis points to a mid-price of
89.5 basis points, the most since Feb. 4, CMA prices show.
Morgan Stanley swaps jumped 34 to 184.5. Contracts on Merrill
rose 37 to 193 and Bank of America swaps increased 37 to 162,
CMA prices show. 
Markit CDX Index 
Swaps on Citigroup Inc. rose 21 basis points to a mid-price
of 183, Phoenix prices show. 
A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk rose to
the highest in two months. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index Series 14, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 2.2 basis points to a mid-price of 91
basis points as of 5:23 p.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by shareholders over a collateralized-debt obligation known as
Abacus 2007-AC1 that prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit this month. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the truth about Abacus or the
bank&#8217;s financial condition, investors said in the complaint
filed today in federal court in Manhattan. &#8220;As news of
Goldman&#8217;s misconduct reached the market, Goldman stock
immediately plummeted,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
When the SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, its shares
fell 13 percent to close at $160.70. That case centers on
whether the New York-based firm should have told investors that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying securities in
the CDO -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. 
&#8220;Defendants omitted and/or misrepresented material facts
concerning Goldman&#8217;s participation in structuring the CDO to
help one client who was short the CDO while simultaneously
selling the CDO to another client,&#8221; investors said in today&#8217;s
complaint. 
Investor Ilene Richman filed the lawsuit on behalf of
others who bought Goldman Sachs shares from Oct. 15 to April 16. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment today. 
The securities-fraud suit, filed by San Diego-based law
firm Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP, also names as defendants
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar and President Gary D. Cohn. 
SEC Investigation 
The bank concealed from investors that it was being
investigated by the SEC over the CDO late last year, at the same
time it launched a public-relations campaign touting its
&#8220;responsible business practices&#8221; to combat negative publicity
over $16 billion in bonuses it was scheduled to pay employees,
according to the complaint. 
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the SEC probe in its third-
quarter filing with the commission on Nov. 4, according to the
complaint. 
On April 22, two investors separately sued Goldman Sachs
officers and directors, including Blankfein, on behalf of the
bank in state court in Manhattan for permitting the company to
enter into a series of CDOs, including Abacus 2007-AC1, tied to
the subprime market. Another so-called derivative lawsuit was
filed against the officers and directors today in federal court
in Manhattan. 
Goldman Sachs fell $5.37, or 3.4 percent, to $152.03 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The case is Richman v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 10-03461,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, made an
estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against
mortgage-linked securities, including some it created, a U.S.
senator said today. 
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released e-mails and
other documents that he said show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its
own interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients.&#8221; 
The documents precede a showdown on Capitol Hill tomorrow
between Levin&#8217;s panel and seven current and former Goldman Sachs
employees. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and
Fabrice Tourre, 31, an executive director who was named in the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud lawsuit
against the firm, are among Goldman employees set to answer
questions. 
&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and we
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said at a briefing for reporters
today on tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. &#8220;We think there are a number of
banks engaged in similar conduct but we had to focus on one.&#8221; 
The subcommittee estimated that Goldman Sachs generated
$3.7 billion from its short bets on a declining mortgage market
in 2007, Levin said. The figure doesn&#8217;t take into account losses
they suffered on mortgage-related securities they held, he said. 
SEC, Justice Department 
Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether there was any criminal activity, although he said the
panel will decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter
to the SEC or the Justice Department. 
Blankfein will tell the committee tomorrow that the firm
didn&#8217;t wager against clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against
the housing market, according to the prepared text of his
remarks. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will say, according to the text. 
While the firm disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;We have to do a better job of striking
the balance between what an informed client believes is
important to his or her investing goals and what the public
believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; 
Among the evidence Levin presented today was an internal e-
mail about a March 2007 presentation to the board of directors
that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk started
the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB- rated
mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; 
An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Daniel Sparks, who
ran the mortgage business at the time and is among those
scheduled to testify, includes the comment &#8220;real bad feeling
across European sales about some of the trades we did with
clients. The damage this has done to our franchise is very
significant. Aggregate loss of our clients on just these 5
trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; 
Michael Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
structured products group who is also to appear tomorrow,
boasted in his 2007 performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to
clients who demanded that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program
as clients tried to gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring
to the name for Goldman&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those
were unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of
millions of dollars.&#8221; 
Ties That Bind 
In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from institutional clients. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
&#8216;Incalculable Harm&#8217; 
&#8220;In a number of ways they contributed to the collapse of
this economy,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman Sachs and
others helped inject into our financial system has done
incalculable harm.&#8221; 
While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package that is set to be considered by the Senate
this week, he said he thinks it could be strengthened. He has
proposed an amendment that would help resolve the conflicts of
interest among Wall Street firms that he said are embodied in
the documents. He also endorsed banning financial firms from
engaging in so-called naked credit default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the credit. 
After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
website on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. 
$68 Million Bonus 
Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a debt instrument tied to
mortgages by failing to inform them of the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. The company said on April 24 that Levin&#8217;s
committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence it released and jumped
to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. 
Pecora Era 
While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. 
The interrogation of Goldman Sachs may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. 
&#8220;Looking at this crisis, it&#8217;s hard not to agree with the
conclusion of another congressional committee, which found &#8216;the
result of the unregulated activities of the investment bankers
were enormous,&#8217;&#8221; Levin said in the briefing with journalists.
&#8220;That conclusion came in 1934, when the Senate looked into the
reasons for the Great Depression.&#8221;

Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, will tell a
Senate committee tomorrow that the firm didn&#8217;t wager against
clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against the housing market. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
according to a prepared text of his remarks. 
Blankfein and six other current and former Goldman Sachs
executives will testify in front of the panel about their
practices in the mortgage-securities market leading up to the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The firm
faces a fraud lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange
Commission that accuses it of failing to inform investors about
the role played by a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., in the deal. 
&#8220;As you know, ten days ago, the SEC announced a civil
action against Goldman Sachs in connection with a specific
transaction,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the text of his
remarks. &#8220;It was one of the worst days in my professional life,
as I know it was for every person at our firm.&#8221; 
Blankfein will say that New York-based Goldman Sachs has
been a &#8220;client-centered firm for 140 years and if our clients
believe that we don&#8217;t deserve their trust, we cannot survive.&#8221; 
&#8216;Complicated Transaction&#8217; 
While the firm says it disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
&#8220;I also recognize how such a complicated transaction may look
to many people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do
a better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
Blankfein will also say that the firm favors more
transparency for the public and regulators and is supporting the
creation of clearinghouses for eligible derivatives. He also
said the firm recognizes that many in the U.S. are skeptical
about investment banks. 
&#8220;What we and other banks, rating agencies and regulators
failed to do was sound the alarm that there was too much lending
and too much leverage in the system -- that credit had become
too cheap,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the remarks.

General Growth Properties Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, said a bankruptcy court hearing
on its auction process will be delayed five days to give the
company time to consider competing investment plans. 
Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Asset Management
Inc. are each leading groups that want to back General Growth,
which has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the
past year. The hearing was postponed to May 4 from April 29,
Chicago-based General Growth said today in a statement. 
The delay will allow General Growth to speak with its
investor committees and &#8220;other parties concerning the full
range of offers, proposals and commitments received and complete
its assessment thereof,&#8221; the company said. 
Simon, spurned in February when it offered to buy General
Growth outright for $10 billion, earlier this month said it
would match the terms of a bankruptcy-exit proposal led by
Brookfield. Each plan would keep General Growth an independent
company, and would need bankruptcy court approval. Simon, the
largest U.S. mall owner, has said it is still interested in a
full takeover of its rival. 
General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
making acquisitions. Its properties include New York&#8217;s South
Street Seaport, Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall and the Grand Canal
Shoppes and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., seeking
to reduce assets tied to the declining U.S. housing market,
urged its sales force in 2006 and 2007 to sell those products to
clients, newly disclosed internal e-mails show. 
The e-mails, including communications from Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, show that employees discussed how to
&#8220;arm&#8221; salespeople to shed bonds the firm found too risky to
hold. The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin
in connection with a hearing where current and former managers
testified about the firm&#8217;s role in the financial crisis. 
Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, grilled the executives
about the firm&#8217;s bets against the housing market and its
disclosure to clients. 
In one of the e-mails, Blankfein asked whether employees
were doing enough to sell bonds backed by home loans including
subprime mortgages. 
&#8220;Could/should we have cleaned up these books before and
are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and dogs in other
books throughout the division,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, wrote in an e-
mail dated Feb. 11, 2007. 
Questioned about the e-mail at yesterday&#8217;s hearing,
Blankfein told senators that his comment didn&#8217;t represent an
opinion of the bonds. 
&#8220;When I use the expression &#8216;cats and dogs&#8217; I mean
miscellaneous stuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is part of my normal
point about aged inventory. Part of the discipline of our
business is to manage risk and sell inventory.&#8221; 
Clients&#8217; Questions 
The e-mails show that as early as the fall of 2006 clients
were questioning products tied to the mortgage market. On Oct.
19, 2006, Mitchell Resnick sent an e-mail to two colleagues
asking whether the firm had material about &#8220;how great&#8221; BBB
bonds tied to home loans were. BBB is a credit rating from
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings that indicates an
asset is two levels above junk. 
&#8220;A common response I am hearing&#8221; from potential investors
is &#8220;a concern about the housing market and BBB in particular,&#8221;
Resnick wrote. &#8220;We need to arm sales with a bit more. Do we
have anything?&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar convened
a meeting of mortgage traders and risk managers on Dec. 14,
2006, according to a document prepared by the firm that the
Senate panel released yesterday. 
&#8216;Net Long&#8217; 
At the time, Goldman Sachs had a &#8220;net long exposure&#8221; to
the subprime-mortgage market, meaning the bank was betting the
market would continue to rise. At the meeting, executives agreed
that the firm should &#8220;reduce its overall exposure to the
subprime mortgage market,&#8221; the document said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Stacey Bash-Polley sent an e-mail to
colleagues six days later with the subject line &#8220;Mezz Risk,&#8221; a
reference to lower tranches of collateralized debt obligations
linked to mortgages. Investors in mezzanine tranches are among
the first to lose money when the asset starts souring. 
&#8220;We have been thinking collectively about how to help
people move some of the risk,&#8221; wrote Bash-Polley, an executive
in the Goldman Sachs division that sold bonds. &#8220;We need to make
sure we arm&#8221; salespeople &#8220;with our pricing and have them focus
on the more difficult positions.&#8221; 
Targeting Clients 
In targeting clients, Bash-Polley wrote that Goldman Sachs
should focus on those that &#8220;can possibly do larger size at a
level that would be attractive when you take into consideration
the size of risk we could move.&#8221; 
&#8220;Makes sense to me,&#8221; responded Kevin Gasvoda, a Goldman
Sachs colleague. 
Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson declined to comment
on the e-mails. 
The Senate hearing comes less than two weeks after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm and employee
Fabrice Tourre, 31, on claims they withheld material information
from investors in a CDO. Goldman Sachs said it will vigorously
contest the case, and Tourre told the senators yesterday, &#8220;I
deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations.&#8221; 
Levin said at the hearing that Goldman Sachs &#8220;profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it didn&#8217;t want to succeed, and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
the customers it had pledged to serve.&#8221; 
Making Money 
In a Sept. 26, 2007, e-mail released by the committee, Peter
Kraus, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s then co-head of investment management,
told Blankfein that some clients were expressing concern that
the firm was making money for itself but not its customers. 
Goldman Sachs had reported six days earlier that third-
quarter net income rose 79 percent to $2.85 billion after the
bank bet against mortgage bonds. Kraus told Blankfein he had met
with more than 10 clients and &#8220;individual prospects&#8221; since the
earnings announcement. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur good at making money for urself but
not us,&#8221; wrote Kraus, who left Goldman Sachs in September 2008
after working at the company for 22 years. 
&#8220;The individuals do sometimes, but while it requires the
utmost humility from us in response, I feel very strongly it
binds clients even closer to the firm. The alternative of take
ur money to a firm who is an under performer and not the best,
just isn&#8217;t reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association
with the best is good for them in the long run,&#8221; he wrote.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told a Senate panel that
market-makers have no obligation to tell clients about their own
position in a security. 
Blankfein, responding to questions from Senator Carl Levin,
chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said
the nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; 
The Senate panel, winding up a probe of Goldman Sachs that
has lasted more than a year, used today&#8217;s hearing to pepper
current and former executives with questions about their duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market as
the bank also sold mortgage-linked securities to customers. 
Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees testified
about the mortgage-securities business in the years leading to
the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, was sued for fraud earlier this month by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company contests the
claim. 
Blankfein said people on Wall Street weren&#8217;t certain that
housing prices would drop before the financial crisis began. 
&#8220;I think we&#8217;re not that smart,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;Even the
people who in hindsight knew it, I think they thought it, and
then it turned out they were right. I can tell you for my own
self, at 20 percent down in the housing market, I didn&#8217;t know
whether it would go down 30 percent or rebound up 10 percent.&#8221;

at least one thing during his testimony today before the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221;

Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. 
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said. 
Viniar apologized to Levin a second time after the senator
returned to the hearing room following a vote. &#8220;You were 100
percent right,&#8221; Viniar said.

International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, boosted
its dividend by 18 percent, almost double last year&#8217;s increase. 
The quarterly payout will rise 10 cents to 65 cents a
share, IBM said today in a statement. The Armonk, New York-based
company also is adding $8 billion to its current stock-
repurchase plan, bringing the total to $10 billion. 
The increases may boost IBM&#8217;s appeal with investors after
the company, led by Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano,
posted its smallest profit increase last year since 2005 as
clients curbed spending amid the recession. Last week, the stock
dropped after IBM reported a decline in first-quarter signings
of service contracts, suggesting corporate spending on larger
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a positive sign,&#8221; UBS AG analyst Maynard Um said of
the dividend boost, noting that investors expected it. He rates
the shares, which he doesn&#8217;t own, &#8220;neutral,&#8221; and said IBM&#8217;s
earnings growth is outpacing sales gains. 
The higher payout reflects the strength of IBM&#8217;s business
more than the economy, Vice President of Financial Management
Jesse Greene said today in an interview. IBM has spent the past
decade investing in its software and services businesses, which
tend to have higher profit margins than hardware. 
Five Acquisitions 
The increases won&#8217;t affect IBM&#8217;s acquisition strategy,
Greene added. The company bought five companies last quarter for
a total of $1 billion, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said on a conference call last week. Cash flow increased $400
million to about $1.4 billion in the period. 
Sales climbed 5.3 percent last quarter, the largest
increase in more than a year. 
IBM fell $1.91 to $128.82 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 1.6 percent
this year. 
The payout increase marks the 15th year in a row IBM has
raised its dividend, which is payable June 10 to shareholders of
record May 10. Last year was the first time since 2006 the
company didn&#8217;t boost it by 10 cents.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
were grilled by U.S. senators probing the bank&#8217;s mortgage
business as Senator Carl Levin asked why it sold a set of
investments the lender had itself labeled &#8220;shitty.&#8221; 
&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; the
Michigan Democrat asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s
mortgage unit at the time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; 
Levin, who heads the Senate subcommittee that&#8217;s holding
today&#8217;s hearings, was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from
Thomas Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the
Americas at Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a
set of mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying
to sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. 
&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. 
Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees including
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein are testifying about the
mortgage-securities business in the years leading to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, had been
sued for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
contests the claim. 
Tourre Denies Allegations 
As the executives testified, Goldman Sachs shares had one
of three gains among the 79 financial companies in the SP 500.
The stock rose 70 cents to $152.73 as of 12:50 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs employee named by
the SEC, testified today that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied the
allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this false
claim, Tourre, 31, told the standing-room-only hearing of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. 
The transaction referred to by Levin was Timberwolf Ltd., a
$1 billion collateralized debt obligation holding pieces of
other CDOs. The CDO also included optimistic side-bets on the
performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the firm took the
opposite pessimistic side in &#8216;&#8216;many&#8217;&#8217; cases, the panel said. 
Timberwolf&#8217;s 2008 Liquidation 
&#8216;&#8216;Boy that timberwo[l]f was one shitty deal,&#8217;&#8217; Montag, who
is now Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s president of global banking and
markets, said in a June 22, 2007, e-mail. Within five months of
Timberwolf&#8217;s debut, the CDO had lost 80 percent of its value,
and it was liquidated in 2008, according to the statement
yesterday. 
&#8216;&#8216;The message that I took from the e-mail from Mr. Montag
was that my performance on that deal wasn&#8217;t good and I think the
fact that we had lost money related to that wasn&#8217;t good,&#8221;
Sparks said at the hearing. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t use that term in respect
to this deal.&#8221; 
Sparks, 43, who left the bank in 2008, told Montag earlier
on June 22, 2007, that $300 million of Timberwolf securities were
the &#8220;main thing&#8221; left among a group of positions the bank had
bought from an unidentified source, according to the e-mails. In
a June 7, 2007, e-mail, a Goldman Sachs employee said a head of
sales in Korea at the New York-based company felt like he could
&#8220;push&#8221; a buyer whose name was redacted to purchase more of the
debt. 
Blankfein to Speak 
The CDO was among securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the firm needed to reduce its mortgage
holdings, Levin&#8217;s panel said in a statement yesterday. 
Montag, now 53, isn&#8217;t scheduled to appear and didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. Bank of America spokeswoman
Jessica Oppenheim declined to comment. 
The committee began to release excerpts of the Goldman
Sachs documents yesterday. Today, Blankfein, 55, will tell the
panel his firm didn&#8217;t wager against clients, according to a
prepared text of his remarks. 
&#8220;We believe we at all times worked appropriately with our
clients,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. We did try to manage our
risk, as our shareholders and regulators would expect.&#8217;&#8217; 
Bear Buys Timberwolf 
The Timberwolf CDO was issued in March 2007, following a
Goldman Sachs quarter that ended February 2007 in which one
department of the bank shifted from $6 billion of bets that
mortgage bonds would perform to $10 billion they would default,
according to Bloomberg data and information the panel released. 
Bear Stearns Asset Management, the manager of two hedge
funds overseen by Ralph Cioffi whose collapse in June 2007
roiled global markets, was among the buyers, purchasing about
$300 million, according to the committee. Cioffi&#8217;s funds that
month sold some securities to meet margin calls from lenders. 
Sparks in one e-mail urged &#8220;personnel working on a
potential Korean sale to &#8216;[g]et &#8216;er done,&#8217; and sent a mass e-
mail to the sales force promising &#8216;ginormous credits&#8217; for
selling&#8217;&#8217; the debt, according to Levin&#8217;s statement. &#8216;&#8216;A
congratulatory e-mail was sent to an employee who sold a number
of the securities: &#8216;Great job _ trading us out of our entire
Timberwolf Single-A position,&#8217; &#8217;&#8217; the panel said, potentially
referring to $36 million of A-rated notes. 
Montag&#8217;s Career 
Montag retired from Goldman Sachs in December 2007, and was
recruited in April 2008 by then Merrill Lynch  Co. CEO John A.
Thain to his firm. Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America
in a government-assisted deal at the start of 2009. 
CDOs repackage pools of assets such as mortgage bonds, bank
capital notes and buyout loans into new securities with varying
risks. While Timberwolf was initially intended to be about half
invested in mortgage-bond CDOs and half invested in
collateralized loan obligations tied to company debt, the bank
sold many of its &#8216;&#8216;best-performing&#8217;&#8217; CLOs separately after a
rebound in their values, Levin&#8217;s statement said. 
Levin&#8217;s committee also released e-mails with references to
Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, Anderson Mezzanine 2007-1 and Abacus
2007-AC1, the CDO at the heart of the SEC suit filed April 16. 
The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. -- which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market -- helped the Abacus CDO
manager select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman
Sachs has called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8216;&#8216;completely unfounded.&#8221;
Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. 
Greywolf&#8217;s Role 
CDO managers select the collateral going into the vehicles,
and sometimes reinvest as the underlying positions pay down and
trade in and out of holdings. 
In Timberwolf&#8217;s case, the manager was Purchase, New York-
based Greywolf Capital Management LP. The firm&#8217;s partners
included the late Greg Mount, who joined in 2005 after nine
years at Goldman Sachs, where he helped build its CDOs business,
according to the prospectus and the firm&#8217;s website. 
Greywolf, which focuses on corporate debt and says on its
website it manages $848 million, planned to buy $41 million of
the CDO&#8217;s junior-most tranches, according to the prospectus. In
January 2007, Goldman Sachs underwrote a $502 million CLO
managed by Greywolf tied to high-yield company loans, according
to Bloomberg data. 
Conflicts Disclosed 
The conflicts of interest section of Timberwolf&#8217;s
prospectus said that Greywolf might &#8220;take into consideration
research and other brokerage services&#8221; from investment banks in
its decision-making for the CDO and also make separate
investments with &#8220;interests different from or adverse to&#8221; the
CDO&#8217;s collateral. 
&#8220;Under the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement,&#8221;
Greywolf &#8220;will be permitted to take whatever action is in the
Collateral Manager&#8217;s best interest regardless of the impact on
the Collateral Assets,&#8221; according to the prospectus. 
Mount died last April, the company said in a statement at
the time. Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Greywolf, declined to
immediately comment. 
On Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role, the prospectus said the firm would
act as the sole counterparty for the bullish derivative bets on
CDOs that the vehicle was making through so-called credit-
default swaps, &#8220;which creates concentration risk and may create
certain conflicts of interest.&#8221; 
Matthew G. Bieber, described by the panel as the Goldman
trader responsible for managing Timberwolf&#8217;s issuance, later
characterized the day that the CDO was created as &#8220;a day that
will live in infamy,&#8221; according to an e-mail released today. 
An employee at Goldman Sachs who today answered a number
for Bieber said that he was &#8220;off the desk&#8221; and didn&#8217;t take a
message.

Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for fraud, told a Senate subcommittee that
he will defend himself in court against the suit. 
&#8220;I deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations,&#8221; Tourre, 31,
said today at a standing-room-only hearing of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. &#8220;I will defend
myself in court against this false claim,&#8221; he said, adding that
a deal at the center of the suit &#8220;was not designed to fail.&#8221; 
Tourre spoke after protesters dressed in prison garb held
up signs reading &#8220;shame&#8221; and one shouted, &#8220;Too big to fail but
not too big for jail.&#8221; Six other current and former Goldman
Sachs employees including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein are testifying today about the firm&#8217;s mortgage-
securities business in the years leading up to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, contests
the SEC&#8217;s suit, saying it provided investors with all of the
information they needed. 
In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market teetered, Goldman
Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing to investors ACA Management LLC and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped
pick the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle,
known as Abacus 2007-AC1, the SEC said. 
In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Tourre misled ACA
into thinking that Paulson planned to invest in the equity, or
riskiest piece, of the deal instead of betting against it by
buying credit protection. 
&#8216;Most Important Clients&#8217; 
&#8220;I never told ACA, the portfolio selection agent, that
Paulson  Co. would be an equity investor in the AC-1
transaction or would take any long position in the deal,&#8221;
Tourre told the panel, as media including television crews from
Japan and Russia looked on. &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t recall the exact
words that I used, I recall informing ACA that Paulson&#8217;s fund
was expected to buy credit protection on some of the senior
tranches.&#8221; 
Tourre also told the panel that ACA and IKB were
&#8220;institutions with significant resources and experience in the
CDO market&#8221; and that they &#8220;were two of the most important
clients of my desk.&#8221; 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs also had no economic motive to design the
AC-1 transaction to fail,&#8221; said. 
&#8216;Unfounded Attacks&#8217; 
&#8220;I have been the target of unfounded attacks on my
character and motives,&#8221; Tourre said. &#8220;I appreciate the
opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to answer these
false charges.&#8221; 
The line to get into today&#8217;s hearing stretched down the
corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate office
building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the head of
the line were four protestors dressed in jail stripes holding
&#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for Tourre and Blankfein. 
&#8220;Blankfein&#8217;s not doing God&#8217;s work, he&#8217;s doing the work of
the devil,&#8221; one of the protestors said, referring to a comment
Blankfein made in November while defending the banking industry. 
Tourre was placed on paid leave by Goldman Sachs after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed its suit on April 16.
Joining him on the first panel of witnesses were Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured products group,
Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the same group,
and Daniel Sparks, a former partner who ran the mortgage
department. 
Viniar, Broderick 
Later today, the panel will hear from David Viniar, the
firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick, the chief
risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final witness at the
end of the day. 
Goldman Sachs made an estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by
placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked securities,
including some it created, Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who
leads the investigations panel, said. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t just make money, it profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it did not want to succeed and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
its customers,&#8221; Levin said today in his opening remarks. &#8220;Its
conduct brings into question the whole conduct of Wall Street.&#8221; 
Blankfein, in his prepared remarks, said the firm &#8220;didn&#8217;t
have a massive short against the housing market and we certainly
did not bet against our clients.&#8221; 
Paulson&#8217;s Position 
Tourre &#8220;believes that he indicated&#8221; to investors that
Paulson was interested in taking a &#8220;short&#8221; position on the
deal, meaning he was betting against it, Greg Palm, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said last week. 
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican Senator from Maine, said
in her opening Statement that &#8220;even legal practices can raise
ethical concerns.&#8221; 
&#8220;There is something unseemly about Goldman betting against
the housing market at the same time as it is selling to its
clients mortgage backed securities containing toxic loans,&#8221;
Collins said. 
&#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime now,&#8221;
Tourre wrote to a friend in a January 2007 e-mail, according to
the SEC complaint. &#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous
Fab... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly
leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily
understanding all of the implications of those
monstruosities!!!&#8221; 
&#8216;Not Too Brilliant&#8217; 
In a March 7, 2007, e-mail released by the firm, Tourre
described the U.S. subprime mortgage market as &#8220;not too
brilliant&#8221; and said that &#8220;according to Sparks,&#8221; an apparent
reference to Daniel Sparks who ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mortgage
business at the time, &#8220;that business is totally dead, and the
poor little subprime borrowers will not last too long!!!&#8221; 
John McCain, the Republican Senator from Arizona, said he
didn&#8217;t know if anything Goldman Sachs did was illegal. 
&#8220;But from the reading of these e-mails and the information
that this committee has uncovered there&#8217;s no doubt that their
behavior was unethical,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;The American people will
render a judgment as well as the courts.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, has the worst-performing actively traded corporate
bonds from a benchmark offering this year. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due 2020 have fallen
3.9 cents on the dollar since being issued on March 1 to 95.9
cents as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt yields 2.17 percentage points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries. 
The debt has declined 5.18 cents since April 15, the day
before the SEC said New York-based Goldman Sachs created and
sold securities linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying loans and bet against
the vehicles. 
Goldman Sachs executives, including Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, are scheduled to appear today
before a Senate subcommittee. The SEC&#8217;s allegations &#8220;are
completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs said April 16 in a statement. 
Financial company bonds yielded 1.93 percentage points more
than benchmarks as of yesterday, an increase of 0.07 percentage
point from April 15, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Financial Corporate Index.

Morgan Stanley plans to open an
investment unit in Poland, following some of the world&#8217;s biggest
banks seeking to land fees from planned government asset sales. 
The New York-based company will join Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG in vying for advisory work in a
market &#8220;that&#8217;s becoming a leading financial hub in central and
eastern Europe,&#8221; Franck Petitgas, the head of investment
banking at Morgan Stanley, said in a statement today. 
The Polish government this year plans to sell stakes in its
energy, insurance, chemical and phone companies to raise $10
billion to finance the widening budget deficit. Potential
advisory work on those sales is helping draw in foreign banks,
while the economy is the only one in the European Union that has
avoided a recession. 
Marcin Socha, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s executive director in
Poland, will head the Warsaw office. The bank also plans to
become a member of the Warsaw Stock Exchange to give its
customers direct access to stocks traded in the Polish capital,
it said. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is also seeking to open a
branch office in Warsaw, spokeswoman Monika Schaller said on
March 25. Credit Suisse announced in January a plan to open a
brokerage this year after shuttering its Warsaw stock-dealing
business in 2003.

Global demand for dry bulk
commodities will expand 6 percent this year, compared with a
previous forecast of 3.7 percent, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. 
The bank now expects iron-ore trade growth of 11.2 percent,
from an earlier estimate of 5.7 percent, and coal demand
expansion of 5.7 percent, from 3.8 percent, analysts Jonathan
Chappell and Darren Hicks in New York wrote in a note today. 
The increased trade will coincide with half the ships that
are scheduled to be built this year being delayed or cancelled,
as yards in Asia fail to deliver a record order book on time,
they said. 
&#8220;We do not believe that it is even physically possible for
the shipyards to meet this robust schedule, with or without
financing concerns,&#8221; they added. 
JPMorgan increased its forecasts for what ships will earn
as a result by as much as 33 percent. 
So-called panamax ships, the largest to sail through the
Panama Canal, will average $21,200 a day this year, up from a
previous forecast of $16,000, JPMorgan said. Rates for
capesizes, most commonly used to haul iron ore, were revised up

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, will face off against a U.S.
Senate subcommittee today in a pivotal hearing that could have
repercussions for the future of the financial industry. 
Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released documents
that he said showed the company &#8220;put its own interest and
profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221; a conflict he
called on Congress to end. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, will dispute that
assertion and argue the firm was merely managing its own risk. 
The hearing takes place as the Senate debates financial
reform legislation that could prevent banks from trading for
their own accounts and require them to separate derivatives
businesses from regulated depository subsidiaries. It also
follows a U.S. regulator&#8217;s civil-fraud lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre, for misleading investors
in a mortgage-linked investment, charges the firm denies. 
&#8220;This market is not free until it is free of self-dealing
and until it is free of conflict of interest,&#8221; Levin, 75, said
at a press briefing yesterday. &#8220;It is not free until it ends
the gambling operation that results in gambling debts that the
public ends up paying.&#8221; 
Tourre, Blankfein 
The hearing, set to begin at 10 a.m. in Washington, will
start with questioning of Tourre; Michael Swenson, a managing
director in the structured-products group; Joshua Birnbaum, a
former managing director in the same group; and Daniel Sparks, a
former partner who ran the mortgage department. 
Later in the day, the subcommittee will hear from David
Viniar, the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick,
the chief risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final
witness, facing the panel alone at the end of the hearing. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will tell the committee, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. 
While the firm contests the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do a
better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; 
Shares Fall 
Goldman Sachs fell 0.4 percent to $151.43 by 12:23 p.m. in
Germany, after dropping 3.4 percent to $152.03 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, before Levin&#8217;s statements
were made public. The shares have tumbled 17 percent from their
level before the SEC filed its suit and are down 10 percent so
far this year in New York. 
Yesterday U.S. Senate Republicans blocked Democrats from
advancing their plan to overhaul Wall Street regulation as the
two sides debate provisions including consumer protections and
derivatives. Both parties are trying to tap into voter anger at
Wall Street and the bank bailouts that took place as Americans
grappled with record home foreclosures and rising unemployment. 
Goldman Sachs would probably be hardest hit among large
U.S. banks if Congress bans firms from trading for their own
account. Viniar, the CFO who&#8217;s scheduled to testify today,
estimated in January that approximately 10 percent of the
company&#8217;s revenue derives from trading that has no connection
with customer business. That would have been about $4.5 billion
last year. 
Employees of Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay
record in 2007 when Blankfein was awarded a $67.9 million bonus,
are among the biggest political donors in the last two decades. 
Campaign Contributions 
Nine of the 10 members of Levin&#8217;s committee have accepted
campaign finance donations from the firm&#8217;s employees, both
individually and through a political action committee, since
1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based research group. The exception is Senator Edward
Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware, who never raised money for an
election because he was appointed to fill Vice President Joseph
Biden&#8217;s former seat and hasn&#8217;t run for a full term. 
Arizona Republican John McCain, who ran for president in
2000 and 2008, has accepted the most of any member of the
subcommittee with $337,065, while Jon Tester, a Democrat from
Montana, has taken just $6,400, the group&#8217;s data show. 
While the spotlight is on Goldman Sachs at today&#8217;s hearing,
Levin emphasized that the firm&#8217;s actions represent practices
that he said are widespread on Wall Street. 
&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;We think there
are a number of banks engaged in similar conduct, but we had to
focus on one.&#8221; 
&#8216;Heavy Bets&#8217; 
Levin, whose committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs in June, estimates that the firm made $3.7 billion
in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked
securities, including some it created. The figure doesn&#8217;t take
into account losses Goldman Sachs suffered on mortgage-related
securities it held, he said. 
&#8220;We respectfully disagree with Chairman Levin&#8217;s
statement,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
said yesterday. &#8220;We did not have a big bet against the housing
market, as our performance in residential mortgages
demonstrates, and we believe we at all times worked
appropriately with our clients.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs released data on April 24 that showed the
firm reaped gains on its mortgage trading activities in 2007 and
then lost money in the same unit in 2008. 
&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; 
Among the evidence Levin released yesterday was an internal
e-mail that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk
started the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB-
rated mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; 
An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Sparks, who ran the
mortgage business and is among those testifying today, includes
the comment &#8220;real bad feeling across European sales about some
of the trades we did with clients. The damage this has done to
our franchise is very significant. Aggregate loss of our clients
on just these 5 trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; 
Swenson, the managing director in the structured-products
group who is also to appear today, boasted in his 2007
performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to clients who demanded
that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program as clients tried to
gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring to the name for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those were
unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of millions
of dollars.&#8221; 
Conveyor Belt 
In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from those of institutional clients. 
&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. 
Conflicts of Interest 
Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether any crimes occurred, although he said the panel will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the SEC
or the Justice Department. 
&#8220;The SEC and the courts will resolve the legal question of
whether Goldman&#8217;s actions broke the law,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The
question for us is whether Goldman&#8217;s actions in 2007 were
appropriate and whether we should act, legislatively, to bar
similar actions in the future.&#8221; 
While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package in the Senate this week, he said he thinks it
could be strengthened. He has proposed an amendment that would
help resolve the conflicts of interest among Wall Street firms
that he said are embodied in the documents. He also endorsed
banning so-called naked credit-default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the underlying loans or bonds. 
&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; 
After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
Web site on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. 
Goldman Sachs disputes the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a collateralized debt
obligation tied to mortgages by failing to inform them of the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. The company said on
April 24 that Levin&#8217;s committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence
it released and jumped to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a
hearing.&#8221; 
As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then topped
that in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. 
&#8216;Ultimate Harm&#8217; 
While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. 
&#8220;The ultimate harm here is not just to the clients who
were not well-served by their investment bank, the harm here is
to all of us,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman
Sachs and others helped inject into our financial system have
done incalculable harm to people who have never heard of a
synthetic CDO and who have no defenses against the harm that
such exotic Wall Street creations can cause.&#8221;

Chevron Corp. and its partners in
the Gorgon liquefied natural gas venture off northwest Australia
have awarded about A$20 billion ($19 billion) in contracts, with
Australian companies winning more than a third of the work. 
A Leighton Holdings Ltd. unit is among Australian
contractors that have gained more than A$7 billion in combined
Gorgon orders, Chevron Australia said in its Frontier magazine.
The company plans to add 700 workers in Australia by the end of
this year as the country&#8217;s importance to Chevron&#8217;s global
operations grows. 
Australian gas developments have become the &#8220;centerpiece&#8221;
of Chevron&#8217;s growth strategy as the second-largest U.S. energy
producer advances the A$43 billion Gorgon venture, Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in the publication. 
Chevron expects to employ more than 2,500 people in
Australia by the end of 2010, compared with 1,800 now, the
company said. Gorgon, due to start LNG exports in 2014, has
already generated almost 3,000 jobs, the company estimated. 
The construction of Gorgon on the Barrow Island nature
reserve is proceeding after San Ramon, California-based Chevron,
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc approved the project
last year. Unions and contractors reached an agreement on
working conditions in January, Chevron said. 
The venture, Australia&#8217;s largest resources investment, will
spend A$20 billion on Australian &#8220;goods and services&#8221; over the
next five years, Chevron said. The U.S. oil and gas producer&#8217;s
Wheatstone venture, also in Western Australia, is among more
than a dozen proposed LNG projects in Australia targeting rising
Asian demand for cleaner-burning fuels.

An environmental report for Chevron
Corp.&#8217;s plan to upgrade an oil refinery near San Francisco
failed to adequately specify whether heavier and more polluting
crude oil could be processed or disclose measures for mitigating
increases in greenhouse gas emissions, a California court ruled. 
A state appeals court in San Francisco yesterday found that
elements of the report violated requirements of California&#8217;s
environmental quality law. The Richmond City Council relied on
the report when it voted 5-4 in 2008 to issue permits for the
Chevron project in that city, according to the ruling. 
The project, which would replace equipment including a
40-year-old hydrogen unit, was halted after a state court judge
ruled that an environmental permit was inadequate. Groups
including Earthjustice and Communities for a Better Environment
alleged in a lawsuit that the project would increase pollution. 
Chevron is reviewing the ruling, said spokesman Brent
Tippen, in an e-mailed statement. 
&#8220;We feel both the evidence and the law amply supported the
adequacy of the environmental impact report prepared by the city
of Richmond for the renewal project,&#8221; Tippen said in the
statement. &#8220;Chevron believes that the renewal project was
properly analyzed and permitted.&#8221; 
Chevron and environmental groups halted talks on reviving
the project, Chevron said in July. 
The case is Communities for a Better Environment v. City of
Richmond, A125618, Court of Appeal (San Francisco).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which for
years saw no need to play a traditional Washington lobbying
game, is deploying former lawmakers and crisis specialists as it
tries to tamp down the political firestorm threatening its well-
honed brand. 
The firm&#8217;s 12-person government affairs office in
Washington is aiding what one person involved called a franchise
protection strategy in the wake of a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud suit against the firm this month. Advisers
include an ex-House Democratic Leader, a chief of staff to
President Ronald Reagan, President Bill Clinton&#8217;s SEC chairman
and President Barack Obama&#8217;s first White House counsel. 
The first test of the campaign comes today as Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six other current or
former Goldman Sachs employees testify before a Senate panel
investigating the company&#8217;s role in fueling the subprime loan
crisis. The grilling is a turnabout for the firm, which has seen
its former partners become Treasury secretaries, top
presidential aides and even senators. 
&#8220;Goldman relied on their top-level connections so they
wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the public relations and the crisis
lobbying,&#8221; said Mark Corallo, a former Justice Department
spokesman who now provides communications advice to companies.
&#8220;Seemingly they haven&#8217;t learned the lesson of politics: In a
crisis, it&#8217;s every man for himself.&#8221;

Levin, who questioned Goldman Sachs executives during a

JPMorgan Chase  Co. will stop
financing tax-refund loans for about 13,000 independent U.S.
preparers, according to a person at the bank briefed on the
matter, a move that may drive customers toward HR Block Inc. 
The bank decided tax-refund loans don&#8217;t fit the New York-
based company&#8217;s strategic plans, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced.
American Banker, the industry trade journal, reported the halt
earlier today. 
&#8220;Block is the biggest winner in this,&#8221; said John Hewitt,
chief executive officer of Liberty Tax Service, a privately held
company in Virginia Beach, Virginia, that also may benefit. 
Refund-anticipation loans, or RALs, are used to attract
clients who need cash immediately by offering short-term loans
based on the expected amount of their tax refunds. Consumer
groups fault RALs for putting people deeper in debt, with interest rates on some versions that exceed 100 percent on an
annualized basis. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender after Bank of
America Corp., joins banks that have stopped offering refund-
anticipation loans or plan to do so, including London-based HSBC
Holdings Plc and Santa Barbara Bank  Trust. The decision may
give Kansas City, Missouri-based HR Block an advantage through
2013, when its contract with HSBC expires.

Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Dan Toscano as co-head of global
leveraged and acquisition finance as lending to non-investment
grade companies rebounds. 
Toscano, 45, will join the New York-based firm May 3 and
will lead the group with Gene Martin, according to an internal
memo from Raj Dhanda, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s head of global capital
markets. A copy of the memo was obtained by Bloomberg News and
confirmed by Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Mary Claire Delaney. 
Toscano was co-head of leveraged and acquisition finance in
the Americas at HSBC Holdings Plc, which he left last year. He
also worked in leveraged finance at Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers
Trust Co. for almost 16 years, according to the memo. 
Leveraged lending has rebounded this year after the amount
of high-yield loans dropped in 2009 to the lowest level since
2001. Companies borrowed $66.8 billion in the U.S. syndicated
leveraged loan market in the first quarter, more than five times
that of a year earlier, according to Bloomberg data. High-yield,
or leveraged, loans are those rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service or BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. led
lenders to CF Industries Holdings Inc. to finance the $4.7
billion takeover of Terra Industries Inc., which was completed
this month. 
Toscano is at least the fourth senior hire for Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s capital markets unit in the last six months. The firm
hired John Moore from 3i Capital to serve as co-head of equity
capital markets for the Americas earlier this month, according
to an April 12 memo. 
Last month, the unit hired Wylie Collins a vice chairman
for global capital markets. He was previously head of Americas
debt capital markets at Merrill Lynch  Co. Morgan Stanley hired
David Moffitt, also a former Merrill Lynch executive, in
November as head of global credit solutions. 
Whit Marshall will serve as head of leveraged and
acquisition finance for the Americas, and Matt Naber and Mark
Walsh will continue to lead the unit in Europe, the memo said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Petroleo
Brasileiro SA and other oil producers offered Argentine workers
an 18 percent raise in a bid to avert a nationwide strike that
could lead to fuel shortages, an industry group said. 
The Oil Industry Chamber, which also represents Royal Dutch
Shell Plc in salary negotiations with unions, will discuss the
offer in government-brokered talks with union officials
tomorrow, Executive Director Enrique Pourteau said in a
telephone interview today. The Argentine Federation of Oil, Gas
and Biofuel Workers called a strike for April 30. 
Petrobras, Exxon, Shell, Destileria Argentina de Petroleo
SA and Rutilex Hidrocarburos Argentinos SA refine about 50
percent of the country&#8217;s fuel in the seven cities where the
federation plans the stoppage. A fuel shortage in Argentina
would come at a time when neighboring Chile is boosting imports
from Asia to cover domestic demand after a Feb. 27 earthquake
devastated the country&#8217;s biggest refinery. 
The union hasn&#8217;t named the units that will be affected by
the Argentine strike. Eight refineries in the seven cities have
a combined capacity to process 330,800 barrels of oil a day, or
about 50 percent of Argentina&#8217;s total refining capacity,
according to Bloomberg data. 
Repsol YPF SA&#8217;s Argentine unit said in an e-mail to
Bloomberg News that its three refineries in the country won&#8217;t be
affected by a strike because its workers belong to a different
union. The units have a combined capacity to process 320,000
barrels per day.

Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co.,
the world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of Coke beverages, has
surpassed National Bank of Greece SA to become the nation&#8217;s
biggest company by market value after the Greek debt crisis
caused banking stocks to plunge. 
Coca-Cola Hellenic, which is 24 percent owned by the Coca-
Cola Co., has a value of more than 7 billion euros ($9.3
billion), the only such company on the Athens exchange, after
National Bank plunged more than 41 percent this year on concern
over the country&#8217;s debt. Shares in the bottler gained 0.5
percent to 19.80 euros today, for a value of 7.2 billion euros. 
National Bank, the country&#8217;s oldest and biggest bank,
rebounded today for the first time since April 15 after the
country&#8217;s securities regulator banned short selling on the
bourse for two months. The lender gained 8.5 percent to 10.85
euros, valuing the business at 6.5 billion euros. 
Athens-based CCHBC bottles Coca-Cola drinks, teas, water
and juices in 27 European countries, including Russia, and
Nigeria, and its geographical expansion has helped buffer the
company from the effects of the Greek economic crisis. The
company may tomorrow say first-quarter profit jumped to 13.9
million euros ($18.5 million) from 1.9 million euros a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
endured more than 10 hours of congressional grilling in one of
the most public, and most hostile, political lashings in the
firm&#8217;s 141-year history. By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s
market value had risen by $549 million. 
Senator Carl Levin and members of his Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations said evidence they presented made
the case for Congress to pass legislation tightening financial
regulation. Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable
securities firm, was alone among 79 stocks of the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index in posting a gain yesterday. 
&#8220;Both sides got what they wanted,&#8221; said Robert Hillman, a
securities law professor at the University of California, Davis.
&#8220;The Senate probably did what it felt it had to do, which was
bring Goldman people up and embarrass them. For Goldman, the
goal was to demonstrate that they had not engaged in fraud or
illegal conduct. They probably succeeded in that.&#8221; 
The senators, capping a probe of Goldman Sachs that has
lasted more than a year, peppered Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former executives with questions
about their duty to clients and the ethics of betting against
the housing market as the bank sold mortgage-linked securities
to customers. The hearing came 12 days after the Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the New York-based firm for fraud,
saying the bank misled investors in a mortgage-linked investment
known as Abacus, claims the company denies. 
&#8216;Jarring&#8217; Realities 
&#8220;The cultural realities of what you all do is jarring to
most Americans,&#8221; Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from
Missouri and former prosecutor, told Blankfein during the
hearing. &#8220;This notion of selling a product that you&#8217;re betting
against is hard for people to understand.&#8221; 
Blankfein, who repeatedly insisted the company had done
nothing wrong, said after the hearing that he had &#8220;no
illusions&#8221; about how hard Wall Street must work to win back the
trust of the American people. 
&#8220;Wall Street has a lot of work to do to regain the
confidence of Main Street,&#8221; Blankfein told Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;We have a lot to improve in our communication with
Main Street and we&#8217;re committed to do it.&#8221; 
In a voicemail to employees last night, Blankfein called
the questioning &#8220;rigorous,&#8221; and said he tried to convey the
&#8220;seriousness with which we adhere to the rules and regulations
that govern our business.&#8221; 
&#8216;Continued External Focus&#8217; 
&#8220;Let me remind you that we should anticipate continued
external focus on Goldman Sachs for the foreseeable future,&#8221;
Blankfein said in the message. &#8220;Please do not let this distract
you from your daily responsibilities.&#8221; 
Some senators used the hearing to advertise their position
on a financial regulatory bill that&#8217;s been blocked by
Republicans so far this week. Levin concluded the hearing by
calling for tougher regulation than the bill contains, while
Republicans including Tom Coburn said they felt the measure
fails to address issues such as how to handle companies that are
&#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; 
As the day began, a line to enter the hearing stretched
down the corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate
office building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the
head of the queue were four protesters dressed in black-and-
white convict stripes and holding &#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for
Blankfein and Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Frenchman who was
the only Goldman Sachs employee named in the SEC suit.
Television crews from Russia and Japan were among journalists
who filled the packed room. 
&#8216;Huge Shorts&#8217; 
Disagreements between the senators and the executives
started with how much money the bank earned. Levin said Goldman
Sachs made $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;huge shorts&#8221;
against mortgage-linked securities. Taking into account losses
on securities it held, the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
securities had net revenue of less than $500 million, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said. 
&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; Levin
asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s mortgage unit at the
time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; 
Levin was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from Thomas
Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the Americas at
Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a set of
mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying to
sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; 
&#8216;I Don&#8217;t Recall&#8217; 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. 
&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. 
Blankfein, responding to questions from Levin, said the
nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers and market-makers have no obligation
to tell clients about their own position in a security. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; 
Levin, a Michigan Democrat, told Blankfein he&#8217;s
&#8220;troubled&#8221; by his view that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to
understand conflicts of interest. 
&#8216;Troubles Me&#8217; 
&#8220;You can make sure that someone you sell an investment to
knows that you believe it&#8217;s a bad investment,&#8221; Levin said.
&#8220;You obviously don&#8217;t see that. It troubles me that you don&#8217;t
see that.&#8221; 
Levin added, &#8220;It troubles me that you don&#8217;t see that your
client is yourself. Goldman Sachs has turned itself into its own
client.&#8221; 
The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market, helped the Abacus CDO manager
select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman Sachs has
called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; Paulson
wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. 
Tourre, wearing a charcoal-gray suit, white shirt and red-
and-navy striped tie, testified that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied
the allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this
false claim,&#8221; Tourre told the standing-room-only hearing. 
Conveying Risks 
&#8220;The securities weren&#8217;t meant to fail; they succeeded by
conveying the risks that people wanted,&#8221; Blankfein told Senator
Jon Tester about the Abacus deal. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re speaking a different language
here,&#8221; replied Tester, a Democrat from Montana who was a farmer
before he entered politics. Tester said &#8220;it seemed to me more
than just a little bit odd&#8221; that Paulson helped pick securities
even as he was betting against a CDO that later collapsed in
value. 
The politicians expressed frustration over a lack of direct
answers during the first panel, which lasted more than five
hours and featured testimony from Tourre; Sparks; Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured-products group;
and Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the group. 
Levin and Viniar, the chief financial officer, agreed on at
least one thing during his testimony: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221; 
&#8216;Very Unfortunate&#8217; 
&#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate to have on e-mail,&#8221;
Viniar said, drawing laughter from the audience and the press,
after Levin asked how he felt when he read e-mails in which
Goldman Sachs employees described mortgage-linked securities as
&#8220;crap&#8221; or &#8220;shitty.&#8221; 
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t take that the wrong way,&#8221; Viniar said when
pressed by Levin. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate for anyone
to have said that in any form.&#8221; 
Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. 
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest company, posted a smaller gain in first-quarter profit
than analysts estimated as health-care legislation increased
costs and U.S. refineries operated at a loss. 
Net income rose 38 percent to $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a
share, from $4.55 billion, or 92 cents, a year earlier, Irving,
Texas-based Exxon said today in a statement. Per-share profit
was 8 cents below the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. 
Exxon recorded a $200 million charge to reflect an increase
in health-care costs driven by legislation that President Barack
Obama signed into law last month. The company&#8217;s U.S. refineries
lost more than $600,000 a day as gains in gasoline and diesel
prices failed to keep pace with crude-oil costs. 
&#8220;The costs of health-care legislation are a hit every
company is going to take in one shape or another,&#8221; said Gianna
Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research in Flossmoor,
Illinois. &#8220;In refining, they&#8217;re taking it on the chin because
crude is so expensive and demand for fuel is lackluster.&#8221; 
Exxon fell 53 cents to $68.66 as of the 4 p.m. close of New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has 10 buy
ratings from analysts, 10 holds and 1 sell. 
The profit increase was Exxon&#8217;s first since the 2008 third
quarter. The company benefited from a jump in oil prices and its
biggest gain in first-quarter crude and natural-gas production
since 2000. Revenue climbed 41 percent to $90.3 billion. 
Cash Stockpile Grows 
The company spent $2 billion on share buybacks during the
first three months of the year and intends to maintain that pace
of purchases during the current quarter, according to the
statement. Exxon&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents rose by $3 billion
during the January-to-March period, to $13.7 billion. 
Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 66 percent to $5.81
billion. Exxon was paid an average of $74.21 per barrel of crude
sold outside the U.S., a 77 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to data on the company&#8217;s Web site. 
Exxon increased production 4.5 percent to the equivalent of
4.36 million barrels of crude a day, led by higher gas output in
the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Gas from Exxon&#8217;s
U.S. wells sold for $5.32 per thousand cubic feet, a 15 percent
increase. 
Global oil demand increased enough to fill 83 supertankers
after economies around the world emerged from recession,
according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. 
Refining Margins Narrow 
Exxon&#8217;s worldwide refining profit tumbled 97 percent to $37
million as margins from processing crude into fuels such as
gasoline and jet fuel in the U.S. evaporated. Chemicals earnings
more than tripled to $1.25 billion. 
Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans $28 billion in
capital spending this year to boost production with new wells
from California to the Middle East and to upgrade refineries.
Exxon also agreed in December to buy XTO Energy Inc., the
largest U.S. gas producer, for more than $29 billion. 
Exxon plans to close the purchase of Fort Worth, Texas-
based XTO by the end of June. The acquisition, Exxon&#8217;s largest
since it bought the former Mobil Corp. in 1999, will give the
company access to XTO&#8217;s gas reserves and its expertise in
tapping rock formations impervious to conventional drilling
techniques. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company,
yesterday said its net income climbed 57 percent to $5.48
billion. BP Plc of London said April 27 that its first-quarter
profit more than doubled to $6.08 billion. 
Earnings also more than doubled at ConocoPhillips and
Occidental Petroleum Corp., the third- and fourth-largest U.S.
oil companies by market value, which released their reports
today. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company, is
scheduled to report earnings tomorrow.

Options traders are boosting bets
that shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most-profitable
Wall Street firm, will rebound from losses spurred by the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit. 
Investors used a butterfly strategy yesterday, spending an
average of $1.56 per trade on contracts expiring in June,
according to a report from Interactive Brokers Group Inc. The
maximum profit of $8.44 per spread is earned should Goldman
Sachs close at $175 on June 18, the brokerage said. The shares
have sunk to $160.24 from $184.27 on April 15, the day before
the SEC announced its lawsuit. 
&#8220;The transaction is a very efficient way to act on bullish
sentiment because maximum loss potential -- $1.56 per contract
in this case -- is scant when compared to potential profits
which are 5.4 times greater,&#8221; Caitlin Duffy of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers wrote in a note yesterday. 
Goldman Sachs fell the most since January 2009 on April 16
after the SEC said the bank misled investors in a mortgage-
linked investment. On April 27, executives endured more than 10
hours of congressional grilling in one of the most public, and
most hostile, political lashings in the firm&#8217;s 141-year history.
By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s market value had risen by
$549 million, and it posted the only gain among 79 financial
institutions in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
June Contracts 
To create the butterfly yesterday, investors bought about
8,000 June $165 calls and 8,000 June $185 calls, while selling
16,000 June $175 calls. More than 108,000 Goldman Sachs calls
traded yesterday, 30 percent above than the four-week average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Interactive Brokers said that traders also used a bullish
butterfly strategy on Goldman Sachs on April 26 and April 27. 
A butterfly spread strategy combines three options with the
same expiration date and different strike prices, with half of
the contracts bought or sold at the middle strike price and the
rest divided among the top and bottom. 
Today, an investor made a bullish bet by selling almost
10,000 calls at the May $170 strike while buying June $165 calls
and selling June $175 calls, Duffy said. 
Goldman Sachs shares rose 2.1 percent today, rallying for
the third straight day.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are among U.S. investment banks that may be
forced to raise an additional $250 billion in capital, cut
executive pay and divest some of their most lucrative assets
under a bill on the U.S. Senate floor today, analysts say. 
A two-page provision tucked inside the 1,558-page bill on
April 21 would change the structure of about 40 of the largest
U.S. investment banks by forcing them to spin off their
derivatives businesses. Another measure added this month would
require derivatives dealers to maintain a &#8220;fiduciary duty&#8221; to
municipal, pension and retirement plan investors, which some
analysts say would wipe out that market altogether. 
&#8220;The bill has moved so far left so hard, that it&#8217;s caught
everybody by surprise,&#8221; said FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia. He said the bill was a &#8220;big, big hot button issue
with voters.&#8221; &#8220;The Street now is just realizing that all of
this stuff is getting in the bill.&#8221; 
The spin-off provision would result in a capital deficit of
$85 billion at eight of the largest global investment banks,
analysts led by Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan Securities in
London estimated in a research note today. It prohibits swaps
dealers from taking any federal assistance, including access to
the Federal Reserve discount window or deposit insurance from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
Spinning out Derivatives 
At a minimum, the measure would require banks to spin out
their derivatives business into a separately capitalized
affiliate, analysts say. It was actually designed to force about
40 of the largest U.S. swaps dealers that also have federally
insured banks to divest all swaps activities, said Courtney
Rowe, a spokeswoman for bill sponsor Senator Blanche Lincoln,
who sponsored the bill. 
&#8220;This would be a sweeping change to our financial system
and it was introduced 11 days ago without a hearing, without a
study on its impact,&#8221; said Luke Zubrod of Pennsylvania-based
Chatham Financial Corp., which advises more than 1,000 firms on
derivatives. 
If passed, analysts say the provision would drive business
to foreign broker dealers that don&#8217;t take deposits in the U.S.,
such as Societe Generale, France&#8217;s No. 2 bank by market value.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which
represents Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and other large
derivatives dealers, estimates the provision would require as
much as $250 billion in new capital. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that the proposed regulatory
changes would have a significant impact on global return on
equities, declining from 19 percent pre-regulation to 12
percent,&#8221; Abouhossein wrote. &#8220;Given the political pressure in
various geographies, we believe investment bank compensation
reduction would be a key driver&#8221; to boost profitability. 
&#8216;Banks Should Be Banks&#8217; 
Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, said she may not have the
votes to pass the measure, and several other amendments are
pending in the Senate that would potentially separate certain
investment-banking activities from the traditional business of
taking deposits and lending money. 
&#8220;Banks should be banks,&#8221; Rowe said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from
Arkansans, especially our community banks in Arkansas, that they
need a level playing field.&#8221; 
Analysts say they fear that anger over Wall Street may
drive support for more burdensome amendments, like reinstating
Glass-Steagall-like regulations that separated investment and
commercial banking. 
&#8220;There really is a new kind of political model at work
here,&#8221; said Brian Gardner, an analyst for KBW Inc. in
Washington and a former staff director for Louisiana
Representative Richard Baker, who was chair of the House
Financial Services committee sub-committee before he left
Congress in 2008. &#8220;The dissatisfaction with Wall Street and
then the Goldman news has just changed the political dynamic.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has a larger exposure than any of
its peers to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain,
according to Wells Fargo  Co. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure to the five so-called PIIGS countries
is $36.3 billion, equating to 28 percent of the firm&#8217;s Tier-1
capital, a measure of financial strength, Wells Fargo analysts
including Matthew Burnell wrote today. Morgan Stanley holds
$32.4 billion of debt in the region, which equates to 69 percent
of its Tier 1 capital, Burnell wrote. 
&#8220;Regulatory data suggests JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure is largest
in aggregate, but Morgan Stanley held the largest aggregate
exposure to the PIIGS relative to Tier 1 capital,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. Overall U.S. bank &#8220;exposure to Greece is lower than
exposure to Ireland, Italy and Spain.&#8221; 
Bonds and stocks plunged across Europe in the past week on
concern the Greek debt crisis is spreading across the euro area.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s this week cut Greece, Portugal and Spain&#8217;s
credit ratings as concern the nations may fail to meet their
debt commitments increased. 
U.S. banks held a total of $236.8 billion of exposure to
the five nations, including $18.1 billion to Greece, Wells Fargo
said. European banks have claims totaling $193.1 billion on
Greece, according to the Bank for International Settlements,
with another $832.2 billion of claims on Spain.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. met
regulators from the U.K. Financial Services Authority today to
formally discuss how the agency&#8217;s probe into the bank will
progress, two people familiar with the investigation said. 
It was the first time Goldman Sachs and the agency met to
discuss the timetable of the probe, the people said, on
condition of anonymity because the inquiry is confidential. The
regulator has a duty to meet with firms it is investigating at
an early stage to outline what will happen during the probe. 
The FSA said earlier this month that it was investigating
Goldman Sachs&#8217; London office after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over the New York-based
bank&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. Prime
Minister Gordon Brown, facing a May 6 election, called on the
FSA to investigate after the SEC suit. 
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London and FSA spokesman
Chris Hamilton both declined to comment. Sky News first reported
the meeting today. 
The bank may be fined or individuals banned if the FSA
finds a breach of its rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president
named in the SEC case, Fabrice Tourre, is employed at the bank&#8217;s
London office. His FSA authorization was suspended at the firm&#8217;s
request. 
Senate Questioning 
Goldman Sachs executives, including Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, were questioned by a U.S. Senate Subcommittee
earlier this week over the bank&#8217;s marketing of CDOs, which the
SEC alleges was fraudulent. Goldman Sachs denies the allegations
and has said it will fight the suit. 
Tourre was also questioned at the Senate hearing. He
started working at the London office in November 2008, according
to the FSA&#8217;s register, and the SEC&#8217;s allegations relate to when
he worked in New York. 
The French markets regulator, the Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said today it found no evidence that local fund-
management companies bought the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-AC1,
which is the subject of the SEC lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s BaFin
regulator said this month it will seek information from the SEC
about the case. 
German and British banks both lost money because of the
fraud, according to the SEC suit. The Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, majority-owned by U.K. taxpayers, unwound a position
in Abacus bought by its ABN Amro unit by paying Goldman Sachs
$840.9 million, the SEC said. Germany&#8217;s IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG lost nearly all of its $150 million investment
in the CDO, according to the SEC. 
CDOs bundle bonds or loans, or both, from a variety of
issuers, such as companies or countries. Interest payments on
the underlying bonds or loans are used to pay investors.

Incentives to buy electric cars
such as Nissan Motor Co.&#8217;s Leaf will &#8220;plunder&#8221; government
treasuries and do little to reverse pollution, a coalition of
German environmental groups said today. 
&#8220;A lot of money is going to be handed out to support
electric cars instead of implementing tougher carbon-dioxide
emissions and making gas and diesel cars more efficient,&#8221; said
Juergen Resch, who heads the Berlin-based environmental
organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe. 
Carmakers including Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG should
focus on boosting fuel efficiency and lowering carbon emissions
for vehicles installed with combustion motors, Resch said.
Electric cars often pollute more than gasoline or diesel
vehicles factoring in emissions at coal and natural gas power
plants, he said. 
Powering an electric car using the existing combination of
electricity sources in Germany, including coal and natural gas,
means such vehicles emit at least 120 grams of CO2 for each
kilometer driven, the environmental groups said. That&#8217;s more
than Volkswagen&#8217;s least-polluting Polo at 99 grams and Daimler&#8217;s
Smart car, which has a carbon output of 87 grams. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel is to meet May 3 with
representatives from the automobile and energy industries in
Berlin to discuss the future of electric mobility.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s legal
troubles may be contained to the U.S. as investors in Europe bet
regulation will lead to more stability for banks, said Gary
Jenkins, head of credit strategy at Evolution Securities Ltd. 
Bonds of U.K. banks have returned 0.28 percent since
Goldman was accused of defrauding investors 11 days ago,
compared with losses of 0.75 percent in the U.S., according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate
Index. Securities of New York-based Goldman gave up 3.45 percent
in the same period, making them the worst performers among the
biggest firms in the benchmark. 
&#8220;More intense regulation isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing,&#8221;
Jenkins said. &#8220;Bondholders are concerned about the ability of
banks to repay debt. The more stable financial firms are and the
more focus there is on a steady return over a business cycle,
the better for bondholders.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, became on April 16 the first major bank accused by the
Securities and Exchange Commission of fraud connected to the
collapse of the subprime mortgage market. Investors in the U.S.
have &#8220;woken up&#8221; to the Obama Administration&#8217;s determination to
target investment banks, while regulators in Europe have been
more passive, Jenkins said. 
&#8220;The Goldman Sachs SEC investigation is having much more
of an impact in the U.S. than in Europe,&#8221; he said. 
&#8216;Significant Upside&#8217; 
Investors in Europe are favoring bonds of Barclays Plc,
Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said
Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at LNG Capital LLP, a
London-based hedge fund he co-founded in 2006. Barclays bonds
have gained 0.08 percent since April 15, while debt of Lloyds
returned 0.41 percent, Bank of America data show. RBS bonds
gained 0.44 percent. Debt of ING Groep NV in Amsterdam was the
best bank performer globally, returning 0.65 percent. 
&#8220;There is significant upside in some of the European banks
as a result of the decimation they have taken over the past two
years,&#8221; Gargour said. &#8220;Systemic risks will be minimal for the
next few years and banks are sufficiently profitable in good
times to bear the burden of the proposed global bank tax.&#8221; 
The International Monetary Fund has recommended banks set
aside money to fund future bailouts. 
Bonds of the top five U.S. banks have all lost money for
investors since the SEC suit was filed. Fixed-income securities
of Morgan Stanley gave up 1.13 percent, Bank of America lost
0.72 percent, Citigroup Inc. lost 0.5 percent and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. lost 0.27 percent. 
A sovereign default by a country like Greece remains a risk
to financial firms in Europe, Evolution&#8217;s Jenkins said. European
banks had total claims on Greece including bonds and loans of
$193.1 billion as of Dec. 31, according to the Bank for
International Settlements. 
Lloyds said yesterday that its &#8220;exposure&#8221; to Greece and
Portugal isn&#8217;t material. RBS chairman Philip Hampton said his
firm has less than 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) of Greece
debt.

Warren Buffett, who called Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. an &#8220;exceptional institution&#8221; when he invested
$5 billion in the firm, will have his biggest platform to
discuss the bank after it was sued for fraud by regulators and
pilloried in Congress. 
Buffett, who will host shareholders of his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. at the May 1 annual meeting, was a satisfied
Goldman Sachs client when he extended capital and credibility to
the firm during the credit crisis in 2008. Buffett has since
defended the bank amid public outrage about its pay and conduct,
drawing on a relationship that dates to a visit with a Goldman
Sachs executive in New York at the age of 10. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s more than 60 years of experience with Goldman
Sachs that&#8217;s talking,&#8221; said Jeff Matthews, author of
&#8220;Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Omaha&#8221; and founder of the
hedge fund Ram Partners LP. &#8220;Buffett is not going to be turning
around selling his Goldman Sachs.&#8221; 
Buffett said people who feel cheated by the recession have
unfairly lashed out at Wall Street when regulators, mortgage
lenders and politicians should share the blame. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs
offering the apple,&#8221; Buffett said in a March 1 interview with
CNBC. 
The billionaire has &#8220;great confidence&#8221; in his investment,
according to Berkshire Director Thomas Murphy, who told 
Bloomberg Television that he spoke with Buffett after the  
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs on April 
16. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said 
he also spoke privately with Buffett after the lawsuit. 
Shareholder Questions 
Buffett will take about five hours of shareholder questions
at the meeting and, according to Murphy, should expect inquiries
about Goldman Sachs, which was accused of misleading clients on
the sale of mortgage-related investments. About 35,000 people
attended last year&#8217;s meeting at Omaha&#8217;s Qwest Center arena.
Buffett&#8217;s comments from the gathering and subsequent press
conference are read throughout the world. 
Buffett, a critic of Wall Street greed and corruption, has
supported a firm that&#8217;s been a lightning rod for criticism.
Public regard for Goldman Sachs plunged in the year and a half
since Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
bought preferred securities paying 10 percent interest. 
Berkshire makes $500 million a year in interest on the
Goldman Sachs perpetual preferred stock, which the bank may call
at any time by paying a 10 percent premium. The warrants Buffett
negotiated as part of the deal give Berkshire the option to buy
$5 billion of common stock for $115 a share. Berkshire&#8217;s paper
profit on the warrants was about $1.8 billion as of yesterday,
down from $3 billion before the SEC lawsuit was announced. 
Goldman Shares 
Goldman Sachs advanced $3.97, or 2.6 percent, to $157.01
yesterday in New York trading. The bank closed at $184.27 on
April 15. Berkshire rose $675 to $115,625. 
The transaction is reminiscent of a 1987 deal with Salomon
Inc. in which Buffett invested $700 million. 
Buffett was named interim chairman of Salomon in 1991 after
the firm was accused of misconduct in the Treasury debt auction
market, and he worked with regulators to restore the company&#8217;s
credibility. In testimony to Congress, he summarized his message
for Salomon employees: 
&#8220;Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding,&#8221;
Buffett said. &#8220;Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I
will be ruthless.&#8221; 
Senate Hearing 
Goldman Sachs executives endured more than 10 hours of
grilling before the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations on April 27 about their duty to clients and the
ethics of betting against the housing market as the bank sold
mortgage-linked securities. Michigan Democrat Carl Levin said he
was &#8220;troubled&#8221; that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to understand
conflicts of interest. 
Goldman Sachs has said the SEC suit is unfounded. 
&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein told the committee. &#8220;The thing we are
selling to them is supposed to give them the risk they want.
They are not coming to us to represent what our views are.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs posted a record $13.4 billion profit in 2009,
a year after receiving $10 billion in a taxpayer bailout. It
repaid the funds with interest in June. 
Buffett told television interviewer Charlie Rose in
November that the bank didn&#8217;t need the bailout. As politicians
railed about bonuses, Buffett, the world&#8217;s third-richest person,
praised Blankfein and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind paying for
performance.&#8221; 
Finding a Target 
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to expect vilification of banks,&#8221; Buffett
said in a January interview. &#8220;If I lost my job I&#8217;d be mad at
somebody, I&#8217;d probably be mad at everybody. And that&#8217;s human
nature. And it sometimes gets fanned by people to whom it&#8217;s to
their advantage to have a target.&#8221; 
The Goldman Sachs case is the SEC&#8217;s first contested lawsuit
against a major investment bank in more than a decade, and comes
as the regulator seeks to restore a reputation tarnished by its
failure to detect Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
Buffett, who has ridiculed investment bankers for the size
of their fees, relied on Goldman Sachs for some of his biggest
deals, including the $4.5 billion acquisition of Marmon Holdings
Inc. in 2008 and the $1.45 billion takeover of McLane Co. Those
deals were facilitated by Byron Trott, the former Goldman Sachs
managing director of whom Buffett said &#8220;I trust him
completely.&#8221; 
An Investing Icon 
At last year&#8217;s meeting, Buffett praised Wells Fargo  Co.
and dismissed the importance of government analysts who were
reviewing banks in an industrywide stress test. The San
Francisco-based bank jumped 44 percent the following week. 
&#8220;Warren Buffett is certainly an icon in terms of picking
the right companies and investing with a long-term strategy,&#8221;
said Jeff Resnick of Opinion Research Corp., a specialist in
brand and reputation consulting. A good reputation &#8220;will give
you a reservoir of goodwill among your most important
stakeholders.&#8221; 
Berkshire rose to first place this month in Harris
Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate reputations. Goldman
Sachs came in 56th out of 60. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s an important client as well as an investor,&#8221;
Blankfein said of Buffett in the April 27 Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for Warren.&#8221; 
Buffett said last year in Omaha that almost everyone
associated with finance, from bankers to regulators to insurers,
contributed to the crisis. 
&#8220;Some of it stemmed from greed, some from stupidity, some
from people saying the other guy was doing it,&#8221; Buffett said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may have
backed itself into a corner by speaking out quickly to counter
fraud claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
In the two weeks since the SEC filed its lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs has released multiple written defenses, sent executives to
Capitol Hill for sworn testimony and put Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein on television to explain the firm&#8217;s conduct as
the housing market soured. While broadcasting its story, the New
York investment bank also has given regulators, lawmakers and
law enforcement agencies material to scour for contradictions
that could weaken its defense. 
SEC attorneys are already poring through the April 27
Senate testimony of Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old banker at
the center of the lawsuit, looking for any deviation from sworn
statements he made during the agency&#8217;s investigation, according
to a person familiar with the probe who declined to be
identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. 
&#8220;Going under oath and committing yourself before you have
any idea what kind of a case might be brought against you -- and
more particularly what the evidence in that case might be -- is
going to seriously curtail a defense lawyer&#8217;s ability to find
running room to defend you,&#8221; said Samuel Buell, a former
federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Washington
University in St. Louis. 
Before the hearing, Tourre and Blankfein, 55, were
interviewed under oath by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
heads the panel, said he&#8217;s looking into whether they &#8220;tried to
fudge&#8221; their responses in the public hearing this week.
Blankfein will appear next week at the annual shareholders
meeting to answer questions related to the lawsuit. 
Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. 
Khuzami Meeting 
Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s chief of enforcement, said in a
closed meeting with Congressional staff on April 29 that it
wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate to discuss whether there are settlement
talks taking place, according to one person who attended and
spoke on condition of anonymity because the briefing was
private. Khuzami also declined to comment on why Tourre was the
only individual named in the lawsuit, the person said. 
The SEC&#8217;s April 16 lawsuit revolves around whether the firm
should have told investors in 2007 that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., helped pick the underlying securities for a collateralized
debt obligation -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t
accused of any wrongdoing. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Strategy 
While locking in testimony this early in the litigation
process posed risks, it was part of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s strategy,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm&#8217;s
defense. Tourre&#8217;s public statements make it less likely that he
could change his story later and negotiate a lesser penalty with
the SEC in return for information that could be damaging to the
firm or other executives, the person said. 
Tourre, whose legal fees are paid by Goldman Sachs, said he
&#8220;categorically&#8221; denies the SEC&#8217;s allegations. He may have
testified to save his reputation and career, Buell said. 
&#8220;These guys&#8217; considerations aren&#8217;t just legal,&#8221; said
Buell. &#8220;They have to do with public relations, with reputation,
with their ability to continue to function the way they want to
in the business world.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock dropped 13 percent on the day the SEC
announced its case and declined 9.4 percent yesterday after
reports that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
the matter to determine whether to pursue a criminal fraud case. 
Along with two analyst downgrades, the scrutiny &#8220;puts the
pressure&#8221; on Goldman Sachs to try to settle sooner rather than
later, Matt McCormick, an analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in
Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8 billion, said yesterday in
a Bloomberg Television interview. 
In terms of public opinion, McCormick said, Goldman Sachs
has &#8220;already been condemned, the question is the price.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell in
New York trading after reports that federal prosecutors are
weighing criminal fraud charges against Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable firm and the stock was downgraded to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; at Bank of America Corp. 
Goldman Sachs dropped $15.04, or 9.4 percent, to $145.20 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares,
which doubled last year, have slumped 21 percent since April 15,
the day before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a civil lawsuit alleging the bank misled investors in
a mortgage-linked investment. 
Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
transactions by Goldman Sachs to determine whether to pursue a
criminal fraud case, according to two people familiar with the
matter. The review, which lawyers say is common in such a high-
profile case, is being done by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
said the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on
condition of anonymity. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that GS has long-term earnings
power beyond what is discounted in the share price,&#8221; Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank
of America, wrote in a report today. &#8220;However, it is very
difficult to see the shares making further progress until the
matter has been resolved.&#8221; 
Burden of Proof 
Bank of America also reduced its share-price estimate on
Goldman Sachs to $160 from $220, according to Moszkowski.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s equity analyst Matthew Albrecht cut his
recommendation on the shares today to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221; and
reduced his price estimate to $140 from $180. 
The SEC suit said the bank created and sold collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages in early 2007, as
the U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles. The company called the SEC&#8217;s claims
&#8220;unfounded.&#8221; 
The burden of proof in a criminal case would be higher than
in the SEC&#8217;s civil case. Criminal allegations have to be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Based on public reports about the SEC matter, a criminal
case may be difficult, said Douglas R. Jensen, an attorney with
Park  Jensen LLP in New York. The case appears &#8220;highly
complex&#8221; and Goldman Sachs would be able to make multiple
arguments in its defense, he said in an interview. 
Blankfein Speaks 
&#8220;In order to proceed criminally in a case, you need to
have very clear evidence of lying, cheating and stealing,&#8221; said
Jensen, a former deputy chief of the criminal division of the
U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District of New York who
served on that office&#8217;s securities fraud task force. 
Goldman Sachs needs to be more transparent to stave off the
type of criticism the firm has recently endured, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein told National Public Radio. 
&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript dated
yesterday on NPR&#8217;s website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position
where activities seem to people as mysterious as they were at
the start of this crisis.&#8221; 
In an interview with CBS News earlier this week, he said,
&#8220;It is my belief that nothing unethical and nothing illegal has
happened, but I will tell you if I discovered something like
this, or any senior person at Goldman Sachs discovered illegal
or unethical behavior, we would eliminate that from the firm.&#8221; 
Goldman Annual Meeting 
Blankfein will be up for re-election as chairman when the
bank holds its annual shareholder meeting on May 7. Charles
Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested
$5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008, told CNBC today that he
admires Blankfein. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m favorably impressed by him,&#8221; Munger said in an
interview on the news channel. 
The U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District
&#8220;pretty consistently&#8221; reviews SEC cases that are &#8220;higher
profile&#8221; such as those involving large dollar amounts or policy
issues, he said. The reviews may begin before the SEC files a
lawsuit. 
Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara, declined to comment. 
Full Cooperation 
Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the company would &#8220;fully cooperate with any
requests for information.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Given the recent focus on
the firm, we&#8217;re not surprised by the report of an inquiry.&#8221; 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation hasn&#8217;t opened a
criminal investigation, said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity and wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment publicly
on the matter. The Postal Inspection Service, which also could
investigate such cases, doesn&#8217;t have any open probes into
Goldman, said Tom Boyle, a spokesman for the agency in New York. 
Two former prosecutors for the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
New York, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said prosecutors
have their own investigators who may be examining the case
before determining whether to involve the FBI or postal
inspectors. The SEC may have provided documents and other
information to prosecutors gathered as part of its
investigation, allowing them to assess whether a criminal case
could be made, they said. 
Sixty-one House Democrats and one House Republican, led by
Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, sent a letter to
the Justice Department on April 23 asking Attorney General Eric
Holder to investigate Goldman Sachs, if the Justice Department
wasn&#8217;t already. The department will review the letter, Alisa
Finelli, a spokeswoman, said in an April 27 e-mail. 
Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
trade and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. The SEC also sued
Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president who helped create
the CDOs, known as Abacus.

Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, reported its largest profit increase in at
least a decade, exceeding analyst estimates, after recovering
economies around the world spurred increases in fuel demand. 
First-quarter net income more than doubled to $4.55
billion, or $2.27 a share, from $1.84 billion, or 92 cents, a
year earlier, San Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in
a statement. Excluding severance costs, per-share profit was
about $2.38, 43 cents higher than the average of 14 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson boosted oil and
natural-gas output by 4.5 percent with new wells from the Gulf
of Mexico to Australia. Watson is selling money-losing assets
and shifting capital to oil and natural-gas fields Chevron has
been working to bring online for years, said Edward Westlake, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. 
&#8220;Production was above expectations so it&#8217;s very hard to
shoot any holes in their story,&#8221; said Robbert Van Batenburg,
head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in New York. &#8220;As
long as they continue to bring new projects on line, it&#8217;s blue
skies ahead.&#8221; 
Worldwide demand for crude rose by 1.84 million barrels a
day during the first quarter, almost three times the growth rate
of the final three months of 2009, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris. 
Chevron fell 85 cents to $81.44 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock rose as
much as 1 percent after the earnings report was released this
morning. It has 19 buy and 6 hold ratings from analysts. 
Record Production 
Revenue jumped 33 percent to $48.2 billion, Chevron said.
The company&#8217;s oil and gas production increased to the equivalent
of 2.78 million barrels of crude a day, a company record, as new
wells started output in Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Angola and the Gulf
of Mexico. 
Profit from oil and gas wells more than tripled to $4.72
billion as the prices the company was paid for crude and gas
surged 97 percent and 28 percent, respectively. 
Refining and chemicals earnings tumbled 74 percent to $196
million as higher crude prices squeezed margins on making
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. 
Watson, 53, announced plans last month to reduce the
company&#8217;s refining workforce by 12 percent, sell Chevron&#8217;s only
remaining European refinery and shed other assets that aren&#8217;t
meeting internal profitability goals. 
Watson, who succeeded David O&#8217;Reilly as CEO on Jan. 1, is
contending with reduced access to some of the world&#8217;s biggest
remaining untapped oil fields. The refining restructuring
announced last month includes plans to sell more than 1,000
gasoline stations and 60 fuel-storage terminals. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday that its first-quarter net income rose 38 percent to
$6.3 billion.

Microsoft Corp., which some
analysts had predicted would make an offer for Palm Inc., won&#8217;t
bid after Hewlett-Packard Co. agreed to acquire the maker of Pre
and Pixi phones this week. 
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, asked
whether the world&#8217;s largest software maker planned to make a
counteroffer, replied, &#8220;No we don&#8217;t.&#8221; Ballmer, who was
speaking at a conference in Mexico City, said the company also
will continue to invest in tablet-computer devices. 
Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is used in
Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s smartphones and tablet computers, stands to
lose if the computer maker replaces Windows with Palm&#8217;s
software. Earlier this year, Eric Risley, founder of Architect
Partners, a Menlo Park, California-based merger-and-acquisition
advisory firm, suggested that Microsoft could be a suitor for
Palm. 
Hewlett-Packard has canceled plans for a Windows-based
tablet, expected to go on sale later this year, TechCrunch
reported yesterday, citing a person it didn&#8217;t name. 
Microsoft spokesman Bill Cox declined to comment on
specific products today. &#8220;H-P is a strategic partner of
Microsoft and will continue to be,&#8221; he said. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 47 cents to
$30.53 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needs to
be more transparent to stave off the type of criticism the firm
has recently endured, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
told National Public Radio. 
&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript on NPR&#8217;s
website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position where activities
seem to people as mysterious as they were at the start of this
crisis.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which generates more trading revenue than
any other Wall Street firm, faces a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil fraud lawsuit over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security and is under scrutiny by federal criminal
prosecutors. Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
tried to defend the firm&#8217;s actions this week when he was
interrogated by a U.S. Senate subcommittee. 
&#8220;Someone like Goldman Sachs has never been in the consumer
business and never really had to get out and explain to the
public at large how we do our business,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to the transcript, dated yesterday. &#8220;And now I&#8217;m
afraid it&#8217;s become very, very important for us to do that.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds, played
a role in creating the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, Blankfein told NPR. 
&#8216;Contributed to Crisis&#8217; 
&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So,
for example, Goldman Sachs did transactions for companies that
involved lending them a lot of money, maybe too much money. We
financed real estate that was probably overleveraged.&#8221; 
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 8.4 percent, or $13.42, to
$146.82 as of 2:30 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock is down about 20 percent since April 15, the
day before the SEC filed suit. 
In the future, Blankfein said, Goldman Sachs and the
industry as a whole should be better at spotting bubbles in the
markets if they occur and better at absorbing the effects of
those bubbles. 
&#8220;If institutions can&#8217;t absorb it and don&#8217;t have the
financial wherewithal to deal with the problems as they arise,
at least we have to have a system in place where financial
systems can be put out of business in a way that doesn&#8217;t
jeopardize the entire system by creating system risk,&#8221;
Blankfein added, according to the transcript. 
Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s allegations and that it
will &#8220;fully cooperate&#8221; with any requests for information from
federal prosecutors.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as federal prosecutors
investigate the firm to determine whether to pursue a criminal
fraud case, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs increased the most
since the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s civil lawsuit
filing on April 16, as a federal review begins by the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, said two people familiar with the matter,
who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bank of America Corp. cut its rating on the shares to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing the probe. 
Credit swaps on Goldman Sachs climbed 25.8 basis points to
157.4 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. Swaps on other
banks, including Morgan Stanley to Bank of America, also rose. 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
rose 0.98 basis point to a mid-price of 90.31 basis points as of
10:47 a.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. The index
typically falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it
deteriorates. 
Swaps on Morgan Stanley rose 10.2 basis points to 162.7
basis points, CMA prices show. Contracts on Bank of America
climbed 8.3 basis points to 135.7, and swaps on JPMorgan Chase 
Co. increased 8 basis points to 82.6. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Goldman also recruited Albert Sagiryan, a JPMorgan Chase 
Co. vice president for debt origination in Moscow, according to
the people, who declined to be identified before the new
positions have been made official. 
Wall Street firms are competing for bankers as Russia&#8217;s
economy recovers from its worst contraction on record. Companies
will probably sell a record 1 trillion rubles ($34 billion) of
domestic bonds this year, according to Trust Investment Bank and
ING Groep NV. Both UBS AG and Renaissance Capital forecast
Russian companies will raise $20 billion in initial public
offerings. 
Goldman hired Christopher Barter to head its Russian office
on Jan. 29 and recruited former OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Tav Morgan to improve its commodities
business in the former Soviet Union. 
Hiring Spree 
Morgan Stanley hired Gergely Voros and Dmitry Avdeev as co-
heads of investment banking for Russia, replacing Yan Tavrovsky,
who left the bank earlier this year, according to a statement
April 27. Avdeev will resign as chief financial officer of
Russian oilfield service company Integra Group to return to
Morgan Stanley while Voros is London-based head of emerging
equity capital markets at the bank. 
Credit Suisse recruited five fixed-income specialists last
month, including three from Deutsche Bank AG, while Renaissance
Capital appointed Credit Suisse&#8217;s Nikolai Yukovich to run its
emerging-markets currency team. Otkritie Financial Corp., a
local brokerage part-owned by VTB Group, in March took on 18
people for its new debt and currency market units. 
Goldman Sachs was the 10th biggest arranger of Eurobonds
for Russian companies in 2007-2009, organizing sales by OAO
Gazprom, OAO Transneft and Russian Agricultural Bank, according
to Bloomberg data. The company missed out on winning a role on
Russia&#8217;s first international bond sale this month since 1989
after making the shortlist of 22 banks. 
Goldman declined to comment and Djumaliev and Sagiryan
could not be reached for comment. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named
ICICI Bank Ltd.&#8217;s Sonjoy Chatterjee as managing director and co-
chief executive officer of its Indian operations. 
L. Brooks Entwistle, who has helmed operations in India for
the last four years, will oversee the Indian unit with
Chatterjee, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed
statement today. 
The U.S. lender, which offers investment banking and
research services in India, is seeking a license for commercial
banking in the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major economy. 
Goldman Sachs ranks 16th in managing share sales in India
this year, lagging behind rivals such as Citigroup Inc. and
Morgan Stanley, according to Bloomberg data. On advising clients
on mergers and acquisitions, it ranks 11th, behind Barclays
Plc&#8217;s investment bank and Standard Chartered Plc, the data show. 
ICICI Bank, based in Mumbai, ranked 11th on managing
share sales and wasn&#8217;t among the top 20 banks in takeover
advisory, the data show. Chatterjee had been an executive
director at the company since 1997. 
India&#8217;s second-largest lender appointed Rajiv Sabharwal to
the board, according to a filing from the Mumbai-based bank to

There is &#8220;no guarantee&#8221; the U.K.
will retain its AAA credit rating and the election campaign has
revealed little about what the next government will do to cut
the budget deficit, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
With a U.K. election next week, Goldman Sachs economists
Ben Broadbent and Adrian Paul said the U.K.&#8217;s prospects for
fiscal retrenchment, economic growth and interest rates look a
&#8220;little better&#8221; in general than Spain&#8217;s. Having a free-
floating exchange rate will also benefit the U.K., they said. 
&#8220;While that probably helps to explain why the U.K. has
retained its AAA so far, it is no guarantee that it will over
the future,&#8221; the London-based economists wrote in a note to
clients late yesterday. &#8220;All three rating agencies have
expressed concern about the existing government&#8217;s fiscal plans
and the election campaign has brought us precious little clarity
about what the next government will do.&#8221; 
The U.K. ran a budget deficit of 11.5 percent of gross
domestic product last year and has a government debt of 68.1
percent of GDP, according to the EU&#8217;s statistics office.

Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said a &#8220;callousness&#8221;
toward clients demonstrated in some e-mails released to the
public this week is unacceptable and doesn&#8217;t represent the firm. 
&#8220;There were some e-mails where some people were projecting
I would say, at best indifference, and at worst a callousness,&#8221;
Blankfein, 55, said in an interview on the &#8220;Charlie Rose&#8221;
television show last night, according to a transcript. While he
said those e-mails aren&#8217;t representative of the firm, &#8220;it&#8217;s
inexcusable if 10 people think that way or thought that way.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street firm that generates more
trading revenue than any other, has lost 21 percent of its
market value since it was sued on April 16 by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security. It is also under criminal investigation by
federal prosecutors, said two people familiar with the matter. 
&#8220;The firm is guiltless and this is a big preoccupation for
me and a big preoccupation for our management group,&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. 
Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
defended the firm&#8217;s actions this week under interrogation from a
U.S. Senate subcommittee, which released 901 pages of documents
including e-mail that showed employees disparaging securities
they were offering to clients. 
Most of the complex derivatives the firm developed and
traded had a &#8220;social utility,&#8221; he said, while others may have
gone too far. 
&#8216;Hindsight&#8217; Regrets 
&#8220;If the issuants themselves are too complicated, become
too illiquid as it turns out that they were, notwithstanding the
purpose you may say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s not do those things,&#8217;&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So in hindsight I wish we
had not done some of those things.&#8221; 
The stock fell 9.4 percent yesterday to $145.20, in New
York trading, its biggest drop since the SEC brought the suit on
April 16. The company has lost $21 billion in market value since
the case was filed. 
Blankfein said Goldman Sachs will survive and &#8220;thrive&#8221; in
the future. He said he would step down if his leadership damaged
the firm, calling that scenario unlikely. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here,&#8221; he said, according to the transcript.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my expectation and that&#8217;s my duty.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs must improve communication with the public,
Blankfein said. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge challenge, I would just say it&#8217;s my
deficiency,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t exist in the current state
that we&#8217;re in and we understand that. So we have a lot of work
to do.&#8221; 
Stunning News 
News of the SEC suit came as a shock, Blankfein said. 
&#8220;It was in the middle of the morning, it was stunning,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I saw it over the screen. I read it, and my -- it
just -- my stomach turned over. I couldn&#8217;t -- I was stunned.&#8221; 
Blankfein defended the role that Goldman Sachs, and Wall
Street as a whole, plays in making markets. 
&#8220;You could call it a casino, but if it is, it&#8217;s a very
socially important casino,&#8221; he said. 
On congressional efforts to strengthen financial
regulation, Blankfein said he supports many aspects of the bill
proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
The so-called Volcker Rule, which would require banks to exit
the business of trading for their own account, or proprietary
trading, would eliminate about 10 percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
revenue, Blankfein said. 
&#8220;There are aspects of the Volcker rule that go too far,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I work very hard for the 10 percent of our revenue.&#8221; 
In an interview to be aired tomorrow on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed
Zakaria GPS,&#8221; Blankfein said parts of the Volcker rule &#8220;are
warranted&#8221; and he &#8221;could&#8221; support them. 
&#8220;If it makes institutions safer, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But if it makes institutions forgo revenue opportunities, that
fact by itself is bad.&#8221; 
Contributing to Crisis 
Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds,
inadvertently helped cause the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, Blankfein said in an interview with National
Public Radio on April 29. 
&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein told NPR, according to a transcript of
that interview. &#8220;So, for example, Goldman Sachs did
transactions for companies that involved lending them a lot of
money, maybe too much money. We financed real estate that was
probably overleveraged.&#8221; 
Blankfein told CNN the firm must &#8220;regain the trust of the
public&#8221; to survive. &#8220;We have no choice,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to a transcript of the interview. &#8220;We can&#8217;t survive
without people thinking well of us.&#8221; 
In the CNN interview, Blankfein also said former Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson called him during the financial crisis
and that Paulson was being &#8220;very, very careful to be
appropriate.&#8221; 
Blankfein said, &#8220;the conversations would be &#8216;What are you
seeing? What are you hearing? What are your clients saying? How
are the markets?&#8217;&#8221; 
Paulson had been head of Goldman Sachs before going to the
Treasury Department. Paulson isn&#8217;t connected to the hedge fund
by the same name.

Johnson  Johnson is recalling some
liquid infant&#8217;s and children&#8217;s pain relievers and allergy
medicine because the drugs&#8217; quality and potency may be unsafe. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement
JJ&#8217;s McNeil Consumer Healthcare is voluntarily recalling some
liquid Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl because of
&#8220;manufacturing deficiencies&#8221; that could affect quality, purity
or potency of the drugs. 
McNeil said in a separate statement the recall involves
over-the-counter infant and children&#8217;s drops and liquid Tylenol,
Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl in sizes ranging from 0.5 ounces (14
milliliters) to 4 ounces. Some of the products may have more of
the active drug, while others may have inactive ingredients that
didn&#8217;t meet standards or may contain small particles, the
drugmaker said. 
The New Brunswick-based company said the likelihood of any
serious reactions is &#8220;remote,&#8221; although it urged consumers who
have the products not to use them. 
Johnson  Johnson shares fell 71 cents yesterday to $64.30
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 22 percent in the past year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. must &#8220;regain
the trust of the public&#8221; to survive, Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein said in an interview on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed Zakaria
GPS.&#8221; 
&#8220;We have no choice,&#8221; Blankfein said, according to a
transcript of the interview, which will be broadcast tomorrow.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t survive without people thinking well of us.&#8221; 
The firm is the target of a Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit that revolves around whether it should have
told investors that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., helped select
the underlying securities for a collateralized debt obligation
and then bet against it. Paulson  Co. wasn&#8217;t accused of any
wrongdoing in the matter, which dates back to 2007. 
In the interview, Blankfein said &#8220;I could&#8221; support the
Volcker rule, which would place restrictions on investments
banks make for their internal accounts. He said parts of the
proposal, by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, &#8220;are
warranted.&#8221; 
&#8220;If it makes institutions safer, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; Blankfein
said of the plan, which has been endorsed by President Barack
Obama. &#8220;But if it make institutions forgo revenue
opportunities, that fact by itself is bad.&#8221; 
Blankfein also said Goldman &#8220;made a contribution&#8221; to the
market bubble. &#8220;How did we make the contribution?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We were a lender. We lent money to companies&#8221; and &#8220;real
estate ventures that had too much leverage.&#8221;
